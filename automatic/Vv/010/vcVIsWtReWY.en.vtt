only to save on money to make it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.820 
only to save on money to make it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
breaking down during the other but it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.510 
breaking down during the other but it's
all<00:00:30.539> simple<00:00:30.900> yeah<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> frozen

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
all simple yeah it is so the frozen

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.310 
all simple yeah it is so the frozen
pipes<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> simplest<00:00:33.540> ways<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> fix<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
pipes one of the simplest ways to fix it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.250 
pipes one of the simplest ways to fix it
are<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.770> foam<00:00:35.239> pipe<00:00:36.239> covers<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.170> they're

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
are these foam pipe covers and they're

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
are these foam pipe covers and they're
already<00:00:37.500> split<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.190> wrap<00:00:38.340> around<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
already split you just wrap around the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.790 
already split you just wrap around the
pipes<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.270> there's<00:00:39.420> corners<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.500> grooves

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
pipes and there's corners and grooves

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
pipes and there's corners and grooves
that<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.219> also<00:00:41.340> sold<00:00:41.730> along<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.360> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that are also sold along with these so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
that are also sold along with these so
you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.840> protect<00:00:43.290> all<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.800> pipe<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.399> run

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you can protect all of the pipe they run

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
you can protect all of the pipe they run
four<00:00:44.850> dollars<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> package<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.780> these<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
four dollars a package for these so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.920 
four dollars a package for these so
really<00:00:46.559> inexpensive<00:00:47.250> another<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.719> I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
really inexpensive another one that I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
really inexpensive another one that I
grew<00:00:49.170> up<00:00:49.200> using<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.399> foam<00:00:50.700> insulators

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
grew up using are these foam insulators

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.080 
grew up using are these foam insulators
for<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> faucets<00:00:51.989> outside<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:53.280> was<00:00:53.610> rotten

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
for the faucets outside that was rotten

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.670 
for the faucets outside that was rotten

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
really cool yeah this one is is about

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
really cool yeah this one is is about
two<00:00:58.079> dollars<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> plastic<00:00:59.250> covered<00:00:59.789> one

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
two dollars and the plastic covered one

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
two dollars and the plastic covered one
is<00:01:00.180> four<00:01:00.449> dollars<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.079> John<00:01:01.410> said<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.770> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
is four dollars and John said that this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.229 
is four dollars and John said that this
one<00:01:02.070> works<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.520> bit<00:01:02.730> better<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
one works a little bit better if you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.420 
one works a little bit better if you
want<00:01:03.449> extra<00:01:03.719> insulation<00:01:04.229> stick<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> towel<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
want extra insulation stick a towel on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.950 
want extra insulation stick a towel on
the<00:01:05.519> inside<00:01:05.880> before<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.240> wrap<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the inside before you wrap it around the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.179 
the inside before you wrap it around the
pipe<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.560> give<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.010> an

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
pipe and that will give you just an

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
pipe and that will give you just an
extra<00:01:08.729> burst<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.570> insulation<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> good

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
extra burst of insulation that's a good

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
extra burst of insulation that's a good
idea<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> i<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.400> took<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.610> hoses<00:01:11.939> off<00:01:12.270> my

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
idea and i just took my hoses off my

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
idea and i just took my hoses off my
neighbor<00:01:12.659> reminded<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:13.320> had<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> he's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
neighbor reminded i had them on and he's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.679 
neighbor reminded i had them on and he's
like<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> better<00:01:14.670> take<00:01:14.880> those<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.509> now

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
like you better take those off right now

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
like you better take those off right now
exactly<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:16.830> drain<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.220> hose<00:01:17.460> yes

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
exactly and also drain your hose yes

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.240 
exactly and also drain your hose yes
that's<00:01:18.390> another<00:01:18.720> good<00:01:18.960> idea<00:01:19.080> because<00:01:19.470> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that's another good idea because you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
that's another good idea because you
know<00:01:20.400> they're<00:01:20.729> from<00:01:20.909> florida<00:01:21.240> i<00:01:21.299> forget<00:01:21.780> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
know they're from florida i forget it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.510 
know they're from florida i forget it's
like<00:01:22.380> even<00:01:22.619> though<00:01:22.830> i<00:01:22.860> lived<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> midwest

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
like even though i lived in the midwest

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
like even though i lived in the midwest
it<00:01:23.939> doesn't<00:01:24.240> get<00:01:24.330> quite<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.780> cold<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it doesn't get quite as cold in the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.679 
it doesn't get quite as cold in the
midwest<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.920> does<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:26.850> know<00:01:27.030> i'm

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
midwest as it does here so i know i'm

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.359 
midwest as it does here so i know i'm
from<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> west<00:01:28.049> side<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> state<00:01:28.770> yes<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
from the west side of the state yes you

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.260 
from the west side of the state yes you
don't<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:30.710> where<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> yes<00:01:32.670> by

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
don't know where is for you to yes by

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
don't know where is for you to yes by
far<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> coolest<00:01:33.750> thing<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.200> found<00:01:34.409> are<00:01:34.680> these

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
far the coolest thing I found are these

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.679 
far the coolest thing I found are these
electric<00:01:35.460> wires<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
electric wires and they actually you

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
electric wires and they actually you
take<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.079> along<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> pipe<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.490> hot<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
take them along the pipe it's not hot to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
take them along the pipe it's not hot to
the<00:01:39.030> touch<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.689> they<00:01:39.990> work<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.619> as

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the touch but they work just as well as

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
the touch but they work just as well as
the<00:01:40.979> foam<00:01:41.189> insulators<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.420> only<00:01:42.720> bad<00:01:42.930> thing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the foam insulators the only bad thing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.840 
the foam insulators the only bad thing
is<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> they're<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.890> energy-efficient

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
is that they're not energy-efficient

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
is that they're not energy-efficient
however<00:01:45.149> John<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.479> home<00:01:45.630> depot<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.110> Spokane

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
however John at home depot in Spokane

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.639 
however John at home depot in Spokane
Valley<00:01:46.530> he<00:01:47.220> told<00:01:47.460> me<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.869> don't<00:01:49.229> emit<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
Valley he told me that they don't emit a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
Valley he told me that they don't emit a
lot<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.070> energy<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
lot of energy so they're not going to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
lot of energy so they're not going to
rack<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.689> bill<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.439> they<00:01:52.470> work<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.040> you

rack up your bill but they work if you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
rack up your bill but they work if you

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is this is the best way to save energy

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.170 
is this is the best way to save energy
on<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.590> home<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.670> program<00:02:05.969> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
on your home because you can program it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.150 
on your home because you can program it
when<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.540> leave<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> home<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.500> turn<00:02:08.009> the

when you leave the home to turn the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
when you leave the home to turn the
temperature<00:02:08.459> down<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:09.060> can't<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.660> with

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
temperature down you can't do that with

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.270 
temperature down you can't do that with
the<00:02:09.959> ones<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:11.190> you're<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.700> school
