00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
makeup either but you know it does get

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.400 
makeup either but you know it does get
rid<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> kinkiness<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.989> everything<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
rid of the kinkiness and everything it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
rid of the kinkiness and everything it
smells<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.579> doesn't<00:01:03.180> smell

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
smells you know a little doesn't smell

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.090 
smells you know a little doesn't smell
bad<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.260> smells<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.739> worse<00:01:05.070> than

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
bad but it smells a little worse than

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060 
bad but it smells a little worse than
fixed<00:01:05.670> plus<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> comes<00:01:07.890> with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
fixed plus but you know it comes with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.760 
fixed plus but you know it comes with
two<00:01:08.250> ounces<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> retails<00:01:10.590> for

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
two ounces and I think it retails for

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
two ounces and I think it retails for
three<00:01:11.189> dollars<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> elf

always has a sale always always so like

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
always has a sale always always so like
you<00:01:17.340> only<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.850> paying<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> dollar<00:01:18.210> fifty<00:01:18.479> for

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you only be paying a dollar fifty for

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230 
you only be paying a dollar fifty for
this<00:01:18.869> anyway<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:20.520> reason<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
this anyway but the reason I like this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
this anyway but the reason I like this
better<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:23.100> only<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
better is because not only is it in a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.870 
better is because not only is it in a
little<00:01:23.790> travel-size<00:01:24.479> bottle<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
little travel-size bottle but the way it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.310 
little travel-size bottle but the way it
sprays<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.750> finer<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.070> six<00:01:29.490> plus<00:01:29.880> i

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
sprays out is finer like with six plus i

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.190 
sprays out is finer like with six plus i
find<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.759> like<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.970> definitely<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
find that like I definitely have to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.890 
find that like I definitely have to
apply<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.560> mascara<00:01:34.710> afterwards<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.900> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
apply my mascara afterwards and this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.109 
apply my mascara afterwards and this
leaves<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.409> droplets<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.579> face<00:01:38.820> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
leaves little droplets on your face like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.609 
leaves little droplets on your face like
I<00:01:39.360> would<00:01:39.689> spray<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> won't<00:01:40.470> really

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I would spray it but you won't really

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.760 
I would spray it but you won't really
see<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.350> has

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
see it this is you know it just has

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
see it this is you know it just has
those<00:01:44.159> big<00:01:44.579> globs<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.119> water<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.689> want

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
those big globs of water you don't want

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.190 
those big globs of water you don't want
that<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.079> face<00:01:46.460> this<00:01:47.509> has<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> finer<00:01:48.930> mist

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that on your face this has a finer mist

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
that on your face this has a finer mist
so<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:49.920> why<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.399> better<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:51.210> not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so that's why I like this better do not

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
so that's why I like this better do not
spend<00:01:51.659> eighteen<00:01:52.079> dollars<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.500> fix<00:01:52.770> plus<00:01:53.040> when

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
spend eighteen dollars on fix plus when

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.830 
spend eighteen dollars on fix plus when
you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.520> spend<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.970> dollar<00:01:54.210> fifty<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.890> elf
