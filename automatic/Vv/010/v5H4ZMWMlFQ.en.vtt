00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.690
 and of course everyone is alex of 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.810
 the team of eric van on is not found 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.459
 the presentation of the asus motherboard 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.699
 m51 97 air 2.0 a motherboard in socket 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:17.350
 am3 highest figure seven years 1970 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.020
 right now we are going 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.610
 interest in the information that is 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.470
 communicated on the box 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.080
 so right now the first thing that 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.230
 I was challenged enough on this map 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.630
 mother is double technology 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.460
 smart processor when you just 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.239
 here on the student 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.530
 first the tpe that boosts the processor 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:45.069
 so in clear he goes smartly 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 optimize the system to get a 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:52.089
 clock frequency faster while 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.280
 remaining stable then there is the p so 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:58.449
 it's saving energy in time 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.569
 real so it automatically detects the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.760
 charge if the system charge forgiveness and 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.740
 moderate real-time power 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.650
 so suddenly the noise is 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.980
 less important and not even occasion 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.270
 the life span is extended on 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.170
 the motherboard packaging can be 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.160
 find out who can accommodate the fixed 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.320
 until 8h the athletes of the phenom 2 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.640
 it can accommodate a crossfire 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.750
 also that she is ready for windows 8 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.860
 that she has the usb 3.0 and louis 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 oil as to the inside of the box on 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.760
 found two sata cables 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.160
 so I hope to have a little bit 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.690
 more still the motherboard of course 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.460
 that I put aside we will come back 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:57.909
 after so under the box we can 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:00.550
 find the user manual one 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.790
 manual about bios the boot 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:08.110
 everything is a bit more technical the cd 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.640
 with the small sticker the plate 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.530
 to put children case 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.110
 and full of grace that I have not yet 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.690
 took the time to read so directly 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.350
 on the motherboard so we find 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.450
 the cpu am3 slot more right next 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 four slots for ram memory 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.550
 so there my words we will welcome 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.770
 maximum on this motherboard 32 gigas of 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.780
 ram 8 giga maximum on each 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.650
 location 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.900
 it is equipped with two ports pci 2.0 x 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.330
 16 two ports pcie 2.0 x 1 and 2 ports 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.860
 pci 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.239
 so at the level of rear connectors 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:57.769
 there are two ports ps 2 2 usb ports 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:03:01.640
 3.0 6 usb 2.0 ports an ethernet port and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.800
 the connectors are so this is this 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.450
 video coming to an end I hope she 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.489
 you will be pleased do not hesitate to put a 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.010
 gem a comment and subscribe 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.380
 to see all our hardware videos 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.380
 and soon the pc mount
