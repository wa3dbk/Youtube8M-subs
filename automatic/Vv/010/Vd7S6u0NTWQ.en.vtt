00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.380
 when I arrived especially I wanted 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 continue dancing 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.180
 and there is where I proposed to Khasan 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.220
 do the scenic training in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.290
 explaining to me that it was therefore necessary in the end 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 or mount a festival and we were 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.039
 we really did everything for the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 festival you and the montage on 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.350
 also welcomed artists and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.350
 same time we danced 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.260
 the blue line is the founder of the 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.610
 festival ravensare bring together a lot of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.490
 graf corners that come everywhere 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.440
 and there are also people from the training 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.870
 Scenic schools that leave is 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.030
 to exchange also coming for this 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.770
 festival to have a little a return 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.850
 what is the dance with the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.570
 professionals what is it 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 dance with the amateurs 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.930
 the style that I put in place 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.240
 I call this the round technique because 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.460
 that it's a mix of martial arts and 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.300
 at the same time the classic game remains a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.040
 of course in classical but I come back 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.259
 also in the traditions of my country we 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.450
 do not mix in a little dance arts 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.640
 martial and contemporary and the other my 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.500
 country here that is in mix here is 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.330
 that's why I call the technique 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 round sit-in technique between 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.050
 body language and at the same time 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.910
 the plastic at the same time the 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.910
 contemporary and it's a mix of everything 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.579
 me is that I was really that me 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.820
 allowed me to free myself from 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.650
 discover my body is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.460
 really see another operation in 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.220
 does the body yes they love that it's 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.260
 a loophole it's true we're here 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.840
 where we get free where we express a lot 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.490
 when we are not used to talking 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.030
 with the mullahs talked with the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.730
 gestures 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 what I'm trying to put in place is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.360
 especially for the dancers that the game of 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.870
 mirrors must play and that the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.970
 spectators 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310
 what I like is what su especially 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.260
 beauty of the movement that must appreciate 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.090
 I want the dancers to be able to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 to go further than the dance itself 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.920
 it is only necessary that he crosses 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.320
 almost the story that he's trying to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 understand that's why it's 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.910
 interesting with the amateurs y the sale 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.440
 at the same time they are a little fragile 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.760
 in the movement but at the same time 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.200
 in the expression they are much more 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.510
 strong they wanted to go further 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.670
 and it's up to the spectators to discover 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.800
 a bit of an idea of ​​what they think of 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.720
 mirrors after each one sees what they 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.560
 want it's not an obligation to say 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 that's how it works 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.040
 it's a festival that brings together a lot 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.750
 artists who are painters and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.519
 same time sculptors but 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.680
 especially on the dance speaks 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.480
 a lot more about dance these are 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.140
 dance companies who are who comes 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.599
 from everywhere 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 it's really an exchange we try to 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.540
 to gather a lot of things with that 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.540
