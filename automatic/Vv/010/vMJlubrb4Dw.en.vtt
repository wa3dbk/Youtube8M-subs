some<00:00:34.440> great<00:00:34.680> soft<00:00:35.040> pretzels<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.780> have<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
some great soft pretzels I have the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
some great soft pretzels I have the
dough<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.469> I've<00:00:37.559> flattened<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.180> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
dough here that I've flattened out the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.520 
dough here that I've flattened out the
important<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.020> dough<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
important thing about the dough is that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.600 
important thing about the dough is that
you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.219> bit<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
you want it to be a little bit on the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
you want it to be a little bit on the
stiff<00:00:41.850> side<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.110> should<00:00:43.230> come<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
stiff side and it should come out of the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
stiff side and it should come out of the
mixer<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.160> about<00:00:44.340> 70<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> 72<00:00:45.390> degrees

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
mixer at about 70 to 72 degrees

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
mixer at about 70 to 72 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> little<00:00:46.920> bit<00:00:47.010> easier

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
Fahrenheit so it's a little bit easier

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.830 
Fahrenheit so it's a little bit easier
to<00:00:47.309> work<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.940> colder<00:00:48.270> stiffer<00:00:48.629> dough

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to work with the colder stiffer dough

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.920 
to work with the colder stiffer dough
makes<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.010> simpler<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> work

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
makes it just a little simpler to work

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.029 
makes it just a little simpler to work
once<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> flatten<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
once you flatten it out and get it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.340 
once you flatten it out and get it
consistent<00:00:54.000> across<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> face<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> we're

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
consistent across the face of it we're

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
consistent across the face of it we're
gonna<00:00:55.440> cut<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> into<00:00:55.980> about<00:00:56.190> four<00:00:56.789> or<00:00:56.910> five

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
gonna cut it into about four or five

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
gonna cut it into about four or five
ounce<00:00:57.329> strips<00:00:58.910> using<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.120> pizza<00:01:00.300> cutter<00:01:02.030> once

the<00:01:03.210> strips<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.660> cut<00:01:04.640> we're<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> roll

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the strips are cut we're going to roll

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.330 
the strips are cut we're going to roll
and<00:01:06.240> form<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> pretzels<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:09.740> roll<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and form the pretzels I roll it out a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960 
and form the pretzels I roll it out a
nice<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:12.270> tube<00:01:13.049> just<00:01:14.040> slightly<00:01:14.580> wider<00:01:14.850> than

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
nice even tube just slightly wider than

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
nice even tube just slightly wider than
my<00:01:15.270> body<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> proper<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> tie<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
my body and the proper way to tie a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.950 
my body and the proper way to tie a
pretzel<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.590> bring<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> around<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.400> loop

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
pretzel is to bring it around in a loop

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.499 
pretzel is to bring it around in a loop
bring<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> over<00:01:22.320> itself<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.509> then

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
bring it over itself one time and then

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
bring it over itself one time and then
bring<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.890> flip<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.189> over<00:01:26.400> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
bring it back and then flip it over so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
bring it back and then flip it over so
that<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> points<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> bottom<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that the points are on the bottom and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.399 
that the points are on the bottom and
you<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> perfectly<00:01:29.040> formed<00:01:29.280> pretzel<00:01:30.409> after

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you get a perfectly formed pretzel after

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.609 
you get a perfectly formed pretzel after
a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> practice<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:33.200> after<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.380> lot<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
a lot of practice that's after a lot of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.109 
a lot of practice that's after a lot of
practice<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.280> gets<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.790> little<00:01:35.820> bit

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
practice it gets just a little bit

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
practice it gets just a little bit
different<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:37.020> faster<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
different and a little bit faster and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.510 
different and a little bit faster and
that<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.909> roll<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.070> motion

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that you roll it out and with one motion

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.420 
that you roll it out and with one motion
you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> tied<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> pretzel<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> again<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you can tied the pretzel so again on the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.679 
you can tied the pretzel so again on the
slow<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:48.829> as<00:01:49.829> you're<00:01:50.100> learning<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.970> over

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
slow side as you're learning it's over

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.399 
slow side as you're learning it's over
itself<00:01:52.159> one<00:01:53.159> more<00:01:53.340> turn<00:01:53.960> bring<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.110> points

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
itself one more turn bring your points

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
itself one more turn bring your points
down<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.860> turn<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.700> over<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:57.600> your

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
down and turn it over and there's your

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319 
down and turn it over and there's your
pretzels<00:01:58.549> during<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.640> demonstration<00:01:59.880> I'm

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
pretzels during this demonstration I'm

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.760 
pretzels during this demonstration I'm
going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.509> show<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> safer<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to show you a safer way to do it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.800 
going to show you a safer way to do it
instead<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.369> using<00:02:02.549> sodium<00:02:03.030> hydroxide<00:02:03.630> or

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
instead of using sodium hydroxide or

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.999 
instead of using sodium hydroxide or
household<00:02:04.530> lye

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
household lye

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679

today<00:02:05.520> we're<00:02:05.670> going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.939> using<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.299> baking

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
today we're going to be using a baking

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.690 
today we're going to be using a baking
soda<00:02:06.869> solution<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.220> lot<00:02:08.459> safer

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
soda solution it's a lot safer

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
soda solution it's a lot safer
alternative<00:02:09.420> than<00:02:09.599> having<00:02:09.929> caustic

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
alternative than having caustic

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.530 
alternative than having caustic
chemicals<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.009> bakery<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:12.390> the
