around that is to plant it in the pot
which<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.250> what<00:03:02.490> we're<00:03:02.640> going<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.850> do<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:15.080> put

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
which is what we're going to do here put

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.200 
which is what we're going to do here put
one<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.740> think<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> might<00:03:17.550> be<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:17.910> way

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
one in I think I might be the one way

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.360 
one in I think I might be the one way
round<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:18.930> what<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.890> mean<00:03:20.040> it's<00:03:20.130> not<00:03:20.190> upside

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
round but what I mean it's not upside

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.910 
round but what I mean it's not upside
down<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.030> it's<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.990> know<00:03:22.020> maybe<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.470> maybe<00:03:22.800> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
down but it's you know maybe the maybe a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.380 
down but it's you know maybe the maybe a
purple<00:03:23.340> bit<00:03:23.520> should<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.820> been<00:03:23.910> facing<00:03:24.150> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
purple bit should have been facing the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:34.100 
purple bit should have been facing the
front<00:03:25.110> but<00:03:26.600> ok<00:03:27.600> I'll<00:03:27.630> began<00:03:28.380> starting<00:03:33.110> my
