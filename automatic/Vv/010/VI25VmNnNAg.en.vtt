00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
here is made in the USA and I don't

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.230 
here is made in the USA and I don't
really<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:23.130> decals<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> USA<00:00:24.570> cars

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
really like the decals on the USA cars

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.060 
really like the decals on the USA cars
it<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.779> looks<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.699> solid<00:00:29.699> decal

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
it it looks kind of like a solid decal

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.270 
it it looks kind of like a solid decal
with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> old<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.520> painted<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.149> there<00:00:34.280> versus

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
with the old one painted on there versus

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
with the old one painted on there versus
the<00:00:35.579> other<00:00:35.700> manufacturers<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.110> clear

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the other manufacturers that have clear

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.619 
the other manufacturers that have clear
decals<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.210> look<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> lot

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
decals and I just think they look a lot

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.650 
decals and I just think they look a lot
better<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:42.170> one<00:00:43.170> interesting<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
better and one interesting thing is the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
better and one interesting thing is the
exhaust<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> bottom<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> USA<00:00:47.250> ones

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
exhaust on the bottom of the USA ones

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.220 
exhaust on the bottom of the USA ones
they're<00:00:47.850> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> slanted<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> mufflers<00:00:50.610> are

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
they're kind of slanted the mufflers are

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.479 
they're kind of slanted the mufflers are
where<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> other<00:00:52.649> ones<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.160> straight

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
where all the other ones are straight

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.930 
where all the other ones are straight
and<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.840> show<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:58.309> that's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> USA
