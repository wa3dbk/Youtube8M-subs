00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.290
 today the basic math in our course 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.170
 immigration will bring about the issue of how to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.320
 subtraction by exercising a little bit of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 theory we remember here that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 subtraction presents some elements that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 make up 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 we have 1,500 and subtracting and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 difference also called remainder by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:37.520
 example number here - 3 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 this here is the poison is equal to 7 windows 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 It is exactly the subtract love that is the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:01:00.199
 number and the difference remains or referred to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.910
 difference in this same thing 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.360
 exactly a decent number 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:13.350
 from this solve the question was 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 placed by a student soldiers 2003 of the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.670
 which are the largest delay of 80 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:26.330
 taking 180 from one without the other from 0 to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 40 the number of know each other 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.590
 he says that they are of the two numbers being 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.979
 that 11 athletes avoid already has a number 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 381 of it 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:48.450
 the examiner also as a consequence of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 will be 81 81 call the second of x 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:02:11.390
 Hey singing with the first one here 0001 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.390
 for 300 works of JosÃ © of the other 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.370
 there are those who find the result of subtraction 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 let the difference diminish congratulate 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.549
 x x which presents the same and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.590
 simone cusack missing everything but 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:03:29.129
 examiner who stated that the sum of 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:03:44.190
 army and 50 the rest is the same for the same 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:04:00.480
 to 40 which did otherwise replace 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:04:16.760
 180 to solve that way we're going 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:16.760
 make a time 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.250
 for those issues being used to 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:35.620
 justify not training in x 87 looking for 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.620
 peace or try to kill them on scoreboard 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:13.210
 let's solve this area 100 extraction 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.180
 uncertain hours that added a popular 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:06:12.980
 Flemish season x defeats 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:06:18.430
 but a fan subscribes to our channel 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.430
 so that our work until the next
