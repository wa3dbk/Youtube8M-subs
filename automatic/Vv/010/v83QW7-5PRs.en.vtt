00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.340
 Ananda I'm 23 years old, I work in the box. 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.860
 federal economic today but rather 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.790
 My story started with a contest. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.830
 when I saw a poster calling at 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.120
 procon sabesp contest was for the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:37.150
 internship for two years and I 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.670
 I ended up getting interested because I studied. 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.320
 I spent in this contest I saw that it was 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 possible to pass a public tender 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.290
 About 17 years ago I gave 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.830
 contest for icms 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.350
 I noticed that despite my 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.470
 great effort you are studying not 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.390
 had some way for you to pass on a 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.570
 contest that has someone who had him 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.240
 so I ended up looking for the means 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.610
 find the contest center that 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.159
 helped me to know what I really 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.810
 I wanted for my life, that 's what I did 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.450
 lecture 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.240
 Are you telling me where I could be? 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.659
 studying how it could have been a year 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.750
 the means that I could be getting the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.720
 performance in a public tender and 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.750
 I decided to enroll in the central 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.180
 career in federal revenue auditor 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 in which I am currently studying 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.530
 already in the banking industry I tried to know 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.400
 about the cash box contest 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.910
 federal 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.430
 I came here to look for the plant and I bought 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.890
 workbooks for account 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.610
 but we always want something 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.410
 more and I opted for the tax area and the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.430
 federal income tax competition for being a 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.190
 very difficult contest and you like it a lot 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.800
 I've been looking for help from the 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.010
 contests that is that is helping 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:19.700
 in my preparation for such a tender 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:23.900
 Difficult to study is to study 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.670
 it requires a lot and it does not help it ends up 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.370
 lost in an act that starts from a 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.560
 matter is at home going to watch tv 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 open the fridge closes the refrigerator and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.070
 not in the course 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.410
 Are you regularly taking courses? 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.380
 You have and dedicate a time 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.020
 specific for studying at the day is 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.330
 I usually arrive early in the morning 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.880
 classes are in the cockpit that the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.769
 available to do a study before 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.080
 and arrived no longer 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.690
 already in the room I 'd arrived 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.390
 in the room just to really ask questions 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.160
 of the subjects that I have only with the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.060
 teacher's help in addition to taking these 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.370
 doubts 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.660
 they will actually fall into the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.989
 proves why they already have this 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.970
 one of the public tender 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.370
 There are teachers who have the most 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.080
 20 years teaching then only people 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.080
 who really know what they're talking about
