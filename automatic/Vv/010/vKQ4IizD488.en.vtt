tweak called video pain now basically

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.189 
tweak called video pain now basically
the<00:00:22.890> main<00:00:23.100> premise<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.850> video<00:00:24.210> pain<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.900> that

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the main premise of video pain is that

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.580 
the main premise of video pain is that
it<00:00:25.350> allows<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.070> play<00:00:26.250> video<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.410> can

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it allows you to play video and you can

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.580 
it allows you to play video and you can
just<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.910> pop-up<00:00:30.210> window<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.140> then<00:00:31.529> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just get a pop-up window and then you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.560 
just get a pop-up window and then you
can<00:00:31.769> navigate<00:00:31.949> around<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.940> whole<00:00:33.180> device

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
can navigate around your whole device

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.990 
can navigate around your whole device
and<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.260> will<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.710> obtrusive<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:35.820> one

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and it will be in obtrusive and it's one

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450 
and it will be in obtrusive and it's one
of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> greatest<00:00:36.420> weeks<00:00:36.870> ever<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.100> very

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of the greatest weeks ever and it's very

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.819 
of the greatest weeks ever and it's very
very<00:00:38.820> similar<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.320> would<00:00:40.350> find<00:00:40.500> on

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
very similar to what you would find on

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.330 
very similar to what you would find on
the<00:00:40.950> samsung<00:00:41.399> galaxy<00:00:41.760> s4<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.649> it's

have<00:01:01.050> activation<00:01:01.590> methods<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
have activation methods and then you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969

you're going to go into activation
methods<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.520> default<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
methods and then my default one is

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
see right there and it can change it to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.429 
see right there and it can change it to
everything<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.780> find<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.290> the

none other than Apple critics and let's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.030 
none other than Apple critics and let's
say<00:01:33.930> i<00:01:33.960> play<00:01:34.290> my<00:01:34.530> iOS<00:01:35.009> 7<00:01:35.460> video<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> can

see you can hear the sound and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.550 
see you can hear the sound and
everything<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.610> i'll<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.939> turn<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.180> off

everything but i'll just turn that off

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
everything but i'll just turn that off

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
so if i just simply do the activation

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
so if i just simply do the activation
I'm<00:01:46.140> method<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.950> double<00:01:47.280> tapping<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.759> status

also<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> option<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.849> enlarge<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
also have the option to enlarge the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.280 
also have the option to enlarge the
video<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.440> make<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> fullscreen<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:22.140> you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
video and make it fullscreen and as you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.860 
video and make it fullscreen and as you
can<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.890> would<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.310> right<00:02:23.520> there<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.000> I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
can see it would be right there and I

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.410 
can see it would be right there and I
can<00:02:24.900> rotate<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.190> fine<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.760> it's<00:02:26.940> working

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
can rotate it just fine and it's working

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.080 
can rotate it just fine and it's working
properly<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.310> basically<00:02:29.310> those<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
properly and basically those are the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.150 
properly and basically those are the
options<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.750> we'll<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.890> into

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
options that you have we'll go back into

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.600 
options that you have we'll go back into
that<00:02:32.250> window<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.600> from<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.380> can

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
that window and then from there I can

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.040 
that window and then from there I can
still<00:02:35.610> drag<00:02:35.850> it<00:02:35.970> around<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.600> now<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> could

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
still drag it around but now I could

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.559 
still drag it around but now I could
just<00:02:37.230> simply<00:02:37.790> remove<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.970> from<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
just simply remove it from there and

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.590 
just simply remove it from there and
there<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:42.060> basically

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
there it is and then that is basically

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.360 
there it is and then that is basically
the<00:02:42.750> main<00:02:42.959> premise<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.709> cydia<00:02:44.069> tweak

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the main premise of the cydia tweak

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.780 
the main premise of the cydia tweak
called<00:02:45.080> video<00:02:46.080> pain<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
cydia tweak it's a tweak that should

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.770
