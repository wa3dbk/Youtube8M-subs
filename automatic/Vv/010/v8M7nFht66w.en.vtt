00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
synching bluetooth also has NFC so the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
synching bluetooth also has NFC so the
easiest<00:00:39.390> way<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.690> sync<00:00:40.500> things<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.160> take

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
easiest way to sync things up just take

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.020 
easiest way to sync things up just take
your<00:00:41.879> phone<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> tap<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.879> lock<00:00:44.879> it

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
first tap it to it thusly and it will

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
first tap it to it thusly and it will
connect<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.770> were<00:00:49.890> aired<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> before<00:00:50.579> so

connect if you were aired it before so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.010 
connect if you were aired it before so
we<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.840> good<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.780> nope<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
we are good to go I think nope that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.709 
we are good to go I think nope that
disconnected<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.860> reconnected<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> want

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
disconnected it's reconnected and want

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
disconnected it's reconnected and want
to<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.870> give<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> quick<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.070> example

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to just give you a quick little example

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.689 
to just give you a quick little example
of<00:00:59.850> how<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:01.140> sounds<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.010> again<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
of how it sounds so again think of it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.009 
of how it sounds so again think of it
like<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> subwoofer<00:01:03.149> it's<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> spit

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
