00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.100
 very good to all kids that such a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.020
 Be believe him and I bring you a guide to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.860
 the demon hunter for the version 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.860
 1.4 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.579
 well in this guide we are going to talk about the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.440
 stats and team skills 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.930
 that we are going to look for to exploit 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.900
 maximum the power of the hunter demon that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.809
 is not little the truth so let's go 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.699
 first to comment on the skills that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.980
 they will be hungry arrow with the re one 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.769
 arrow arrow elemental arrow with the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.019
 of a lightning bolt with rays arrow 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.690
 the rune trace of ashes power of the 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.970
 shadows with the runes shadows arrow 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.489
 cluster with runes cluster bombs 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.729
 and preparation with the rune preparation 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 constant good 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.240
 these two power abilities of the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 shadows and preparation we will use 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.909
 well then to survive basically 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.429
 because it is our only way of escape 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 elemental arrow and hungry arrow 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.210
 good we will use it to go cleaning 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.950
 the little white bugs and such and good in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.329
 this case the hungry arrow too 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.959
 for the elites when we were left without 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:27.209
 or without hate the bunch cluster arrow 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.950
 when we use this skill on 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.750
 voices or elites is that you'll see that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 those of the stage or you kill them 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 instantly 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 at least I go 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.020
 good and somersault with the trail rune 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.930
 defined these is incredible has 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 that this can only be seen by the one who 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.900
 have tried and good now you will see it in 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.980
 the gameplay that I have prepared for you but 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.780
 this stability is what there is 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.400
 so good passive 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.560
 We continued with the passives that I had 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.979
 bundled archery as always the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.530
 steady pulse and stalked night if not 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.880
 you have a lot of criticism then what I said 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.850
 in the afterlife 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 you can take it then where is it here 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.700
 aim it will give you critical a 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.440
 little bit and good I like I have enough 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.400
 I do not need it anymore 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.069
 so well let's see the states and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.670
 the equipment that we are going to use and we are going to 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.790
 search at all costs 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.890
 let's see first of all we'll have 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.980
 that raise the skill the probability of 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.200
 critical the critical hit damage the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.050
 attack speed our life and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.720
 our resistances these are the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.430
 These let's look also good 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.230
 life by blows if you want to put the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.080
 true that is not necessary but good 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.829
 it would not hurt too, no, well 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.690
 here you are seeing my are 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.890
 43% critical 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.590
 300% Critical Damage 2400 Dexterity 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.640
 and 22 life hash the truth that with 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.500
 I already passed these these good game 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.800
 is that I'm left now in the gameplay 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.600
 you are going to see it and good on the subject of the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.650
 items and just look at the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.870
 team the truth that gives me a bit of 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.750
 shame because he is not a great team 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.310
 I do not look at it either and it can be improved by 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.140
 all sides but good I'll give you a 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.900
 couple of recommendations as I told you 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.440
 in the previous video the natalia set 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.660
 is the old one is brutal the new one does not 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.950
 I've tried but 20 discipline 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.310
 I only discipline I'm going to 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.590
 get 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.180
 with this drop that already gives me 8 and with the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 natalia breastplate that I have it 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.830
 change not I still prefer a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.349
 old and from what I see in the auctions 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.630
 is making it so good how much 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.960
 before you take it I think that better 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.530
 the subject of the good weapon nowadays what 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.780
 better would be to opt for a blanket tail 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.600
 that normalitas are not very expensive and 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.280
 good if you are looking for a decent weapon 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.680
 if I carry this the truth the jewel the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.880
 I could improve if I'm going to improve 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.490
 fact 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.190
 but good little by little kids either 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.950
 you despair because good any 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.010
 object of these for example is perfect 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.780
 so good the set of in to this that is 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.510
 of good monk also goes very well 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.920
 because as you see here the pants for 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.990
 not so speed of movement and 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.480
 attack speed that the truth that 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.980
 apart from the bonus a 330 and if you notice 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.650
 rather more uploaded to me the dps a 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.440
 heap the belt as he has increase 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.000
 of the sacred damage and my weapon for example 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.400
 it's black damage is to say that it has no 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.630
 damage of any element as it increases 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.610
 that 8% 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.720
 so well we also benefit 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.700
 from another state 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.290
 good are many objects in the 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.200
 bracelets I took but there are a few 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.880
 embracing the recio or something like that 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.969
 they give a lot of skill and a lot of criticism 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.729
 it would also be a good option 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.729
 so good kids 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.360
 save because look how I'm this 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.789
 it's my gold and what is squandered 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.840
 but good here you have a good team and 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.840
 this truth that note 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.870
 so like tps and well, this would be 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.450
 the result 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.190
 you do a cartwheel and the fire that comes out 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.370
 youtube boots then exterminate all 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.660
 the enemies 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.940
 the truth that apart from this skill 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.689
 As I said before, it is also very 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.929
 good to escape 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:37.589
 since good for example they put everything 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:39.769
 in a corridor full of ice as well 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.769
 is 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.639
 we have started to use the time we 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.879
 demos fantelli and now we are very well 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:51.800
 It is also true that those who say that 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.750
 it's not very viable, well, I've tried it 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.100
 the truth is that it is not as good as in 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.500
 natalia but good grades like all 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.900
 If you want to go to the top, you have to 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.200
 look for the best option good option 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.200
 would be 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.600
 once 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.959
 no no during 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.570
 so good thank you very much everyone for 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:20.490
 those 400 subscribers the truth that the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.220
 day I made this channel I never thought that 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.199
 would get to have so many of that 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.470
 true thank you very much to all and good 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.820
 I hope it helps you 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.220
 and that you like this guide 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.290
 and good if you liked that what you 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.480
 I always say the best way to 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.810
 prove it and that horror helps 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.270
 true then it is to give those I like 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.580
 have favorite videos and so on so 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.879
 good 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.500
 with these kids and well I hope that you 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.500
 I liked it, see you
