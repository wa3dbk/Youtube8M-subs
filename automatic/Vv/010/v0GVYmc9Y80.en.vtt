00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.629
 good football friends 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.849
 I have everything ready I have my workout 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have my belt I have everything ready my 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.730
 Everything clothes and pre coach to take me 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.890
 during training my amino acids 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.500
 and post trained you know let's kill the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 first man legs like seo 6 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.530
 so I do not know we 'd be until the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.030
 legs let's kill the squats 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.030
 press pension intentions 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 i 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.100
 we think as not clear that yes with the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.720
 squats this a compound exercise 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.850
 that the truth is that we work all 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.210
 the leg parts focusing on 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.340
 The quadriceps femoris is then very 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
 important to do we always start with 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.390
 the squats companies obviously with 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.339
 a 45- pound batch on each side to 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.510
 a total of 90 pounds for the bar 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.730
 Olympic that are 45 pounds a total of 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.400
 135 pounds we do from 12 to 15 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.480
 repetitions after the second batch what 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.850
 what we are going to do is that we increase it 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.710
 a little more and we take it to 75 pounds 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.570
 well remember that this depends 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.670
 also of the amount or weight that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.350
 you can do it very important 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.310
 Keep your back straight like flax 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.829
 Bencomo these 12 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 very important the back straight so that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.420
 do not go to see any injury in the part 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 lumbar is very important help also 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.320
 with breathing before doing 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.909
 force to breathe a little bit short a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.119
 little bit and vote when you're 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.759
 making the centrality up 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.490
 there I also start with 75 pounds a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 Repeat this routine repetition 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.820
 leg is spectacular you have to have him 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.860
 fear of these exercises you do not have to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.140
 afraid to sit there 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.509
 that being afraid of the press does not mean 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.039
 be afraid of the deadlift if they see that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.140
 the back is completely straight 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.240
 always and that's what makes this 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 exercise will not cause you lessons 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.319
 anyway it's always good too 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
 wear a belt that's also going to 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.920
 allow you is going to help you have the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.770
 compressed back 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.599
 and that there is greater confidence to 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.819
 make your decision the best 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.950
 already we have two series two batches 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.410
 this the third round and the o with 90 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.170
 books on each side for a total of 180 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.050
 books plus the 45 pound bar for a 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.110
 total of 225 pounds also makes 8 a 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.150
 10 reps is very important if you see 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.730
 like treating the quadriceps part 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.239
 down all the quadriceps part 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.459
 femoral 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.600
 they also work the twins work 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.510
 the buttocks and work muscles 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.310
 hamstring this is a very exercise 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.480
 important and I would say that the exercises 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.050
 Kings 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 of all the people we are going to finally do 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.159
 I'm doing with is a risk for me 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.799
 that's why they 're going to see that this exercise 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.989
 I do 46 reps but it did not go down 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.879
 a lot on some occasions because it's a 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.140
 record for my son was filming 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.450
 me and the truth is that I did not have someone 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.790
 that would help me then I did it with 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.190
 much caution look there went down perfect 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.379
 went down well with the back straight with that 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.510
 amount of weight I have been almost a 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:18.700
 90 degree angle of the genera 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.260
 the legs if they see how the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.120
 Buttocks how the whole body works 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.239
 this exercise must always be maintained 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.480
 the straight back is very important that and 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.120
 are going to be also 46 reps the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.040
 true that it was too heavy but 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.720
 very happy to reach that weight I 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.390
 I think that in the day we can get 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.610
 the three cakes on each side and follow 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 keep improving and keep fulfilling 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.060
 our football vision of 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.099
 transform our body and help 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.780
 to you later we go to the press 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.569
 the second exercise the press is 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.480
 spectacular to work also all 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.120
 the muscles 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.090
 lose especially the part of the fact 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.280
 d 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900
 of the buttocks and we also work a 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.230
 little twins 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.330
 this is a routine 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.970
 very interesting because what we do 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.080
 they are pure exercises 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.080
 force once 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.080
 compact 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.959
 in this exercise in basic you 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.759
 I recommend that you give everything 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.860
 the movement to the legs 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.810
 they need to work from the best 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.330
 that is, try to carry the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.000
 knees to the chest to the whole movement 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 complete and at the end when you extend 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.349
 legs try not to neglect the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.900
 knees and that they do not reach the 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.889
 type 14 always keep your knee a 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.889
 slightly flexed 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.590
 completely skin 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.150
 and it seems that the city is squeezing 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.650
 completely sorry 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.600
 so was 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.490
 but this is not the case if they see that a 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.259
 little hamburger knee lime that 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.240
 does not allow me to extend completely 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.390
 the legs that not to force the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.460
 knees 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 and good to see another angle of doing 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.050
 this exercise I turn in I take it almost 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.220
 up to the chest but what a good angle here 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.740
 with the camera of the wpro 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.740
 we make four rounds of day 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.780
 two repetitions with a very good weight 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.950
 as 75 percent of your maximum 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.720
 weight in this press I the maximum mine that 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.400
 I usually work with 6 good cake 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.250
 we have done 7 to 8 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.260
 cakes with 4 repetitions but what 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.990
 what are we going to do are 5 day series 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.660
 two repetitions then good very 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.090
 important that here is jose also 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.010
 trying to give the best of himself with 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.420
 four cakes or you're killing yourself 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.170
 just as they were killing the 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.910
 legs will weigh a little more than me in 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.800
 he does read yes a little shorter but 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.139
 because I have a strength that the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.449
 in the muscles of the legs 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.550
 obviously he is a person who weighs 81 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.439
 kilos is a person who weighs 72 kilos 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.240
 this is very important you have to have it 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.279
 into account when doing exercises 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.469
 which is more complicated for lifting 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.180
 the foot the same weight as me however 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.060
 it does it in an excellent way the 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.740
 third exercise to us are 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.770
 Cuadre extensions look how 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.449
 they see the fully formed muscles 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.360
 of the legs if you can see that they look 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.770
 the muscle mass looks the muscles that 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.509
 they are developing and that's because 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.999
 we do the best exercises that are 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.689
 the squat and the press for the 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.090
 legs 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.289
 we do extensions here as they are 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.810
 watching we make enough weight we are 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.150
 doing explosive exercise so 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.189
 we both upload the pieces so 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.539
 quickly and then we also download them from 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.830
 fast way because we are going with 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:37.879
 a lot of weight we are doing it in a way 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.740
 explosive 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.050
 we make this exercise 5 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.659
 4 runs so fast we 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.370
 explosive looks 5 170 pounds and it's like 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.810
 rises explosively and also 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.210
 down very quickly because it is 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.430
 difficult to contain all that weight then 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.900
 the last batch what we are going to do is 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.150
 that we are simply going to do 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.620
 reps and let's go down very 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.720
 slow but what we do in 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.880
 contractions of the initial part very 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.050
 important this exercise we do 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.690
 lying down we also do it in a way 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.240
 explosive went up a little bit faster 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.340
 slow but we do great weight and what 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.470
 still conscious 30 150 pounds 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.419
 then that was all for today is the 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.490
 legs routine do not forget too 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.810
 work the first ones in the exercises 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.030
