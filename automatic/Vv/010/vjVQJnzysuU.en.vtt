doesn't word it exactly the same way but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
doesn't word it exactly the same way but
right<00:00:52.680> from<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> start<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> pole<00:00:53.760> he

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right from the start of the pole he

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.360 
right from the start of the pole he
focuses<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.989> pulling<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.500> bar<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:55.980> towards

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
slightly backwards so that's one of the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.789 
slightly backwards so that's one of the
reasons<00:03:09.540> why<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:09.810> tip<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:11.459> helpful<00:03:11.879> and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
again the second reason is that it helps

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.979 
again the second reason is that it helps
your<00:03:17.160> head<00:03:17.370> move<00:03:17.609> back<00:03:17.880> which<00:03:18.540> helps<00:03:18.840> your
