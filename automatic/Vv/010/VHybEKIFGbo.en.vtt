intensify as we get deeper into the new

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.650 
intensify as we get deeper into the new
solar<00:03:45.100> minimum<00:03:45.700> which<00:03:45.910> will<00:03:46.090> run<00:03:46.300> for<00:03:46.570> the

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
next 30 years now freight farms they

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.930 
next 30 years now freight farms they
take<00:03:50.050> these<00:03:50.200> reefer<00:03:50.680> containers<00:03:50.940> refurbish

of these containers is the equivalent of
1.8<00:03:57.100> acres<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.380> also<00:03:59.380> when<00:03:59.530> you're<00:03:59.650> looking

1.8 acres and also when you're looking

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.270 
1.8 acres and also when you're looking

Ice Age where you see dark blue it's
going<00:06:31.059> to<00:06:31.209> get<00:06:31.360> cold<00:06:31.749> again<00:06:31.990> it's<00:06:32.589> a<00:06:32.769> pattern

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:33.279 
going to get cold again it's a pattern

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.759 
going to get cold again it's a pattern
it<00:06:33.550> repeats<00:06:34.059> itself<00:06:34.360> this<00:06:34.990> is<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.349> second

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:35.769

year<00:06:35.800> of<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.189> grand<00:06:36.459> solar<00:06:36.789> minimum<00:06:37.329> we<00:06:37.929> will

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:38.349 
year of the grand solar minimum we will

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.339 
year of the grand solar minimum we will
not<00:06:38.559> hit<00:06:38.860> bottom<00:06:39.129> in<00:06:39.369> the<00:06:39.519> cooling<00:06:39.969> until<00:06:40.360> 2030

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:41.349 
not hit bottom in the cooling until 2030

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.339 
not hit bottom in the cooling until 2030
