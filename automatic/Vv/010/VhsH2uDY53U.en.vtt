simple process basically people do this

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.990 
simple process basically people do this

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
better sometimes people just like

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
better sometimes people just like
playing<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> note<00:00:19.770> flatter<00:00:20.100> sounds<00:00:20.939> great<00:00:21.119> on

the<00:00:21.449> guitar<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.380> actually<00:00:22.769> use<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.100> quite<00:00:23.369> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the guitar so I actually use it quite a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.650 
the guitar so I actually use it quite a
bit<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.699> different<00:00:23.880> things<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.359> I've<00:00:24.510> done

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
bit in different things that I've done

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990 
bit in different things that I've done
over<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.990> years<00:00:25.279> anyway<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.400> pretty<00:00:26.519> simple

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
over the years anyway it's pretty simple

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.580 
over the years anyway it's pretty simple
as<00:00:27.180> long<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.230> some

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
as long as you have if you have some

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.050 
as long as you have if you have some
kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> chromatic<00:00:29.400> tuner<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:29.730> even<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
kind of a chromatic tuner or even a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
kind of a chromatic tuner or even a
digital<00:00:30.240> tuner<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
digital tuner like the one I have I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.290 
digital tuner like the one I have I
strongly<00:00:32.040> suggest<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.640> get<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:33.180> you

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
strongly suggest you get one if you

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.950 
strongly suggest you get one if you
don't<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.660> one

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
don't have one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.410 
don't have one
um<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.890> come<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.250> real<00:00:35.430> handy<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.910> guitars

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
um they come in real handy and guitars

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
um they come in real handy and guitars
always<00:00:36.719> sound<00:00:36.930> better<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.350> they're<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.620> tune

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
always sound better when they're in tune

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.729 
always sound better when they're in tune
so<00:00:38.100> two<00:00:38.700> ways<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:40.350> regular

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so two ways you can do it your regular

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
so two ways you can do it your regular
top<00:00:40.950> string<00:00:41.280> would<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.760> e<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.989> go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
top string would be your e you just go

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.779 
top string would be your e you just go
down<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> half<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.770> note<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.399> case<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
down a half a note so in this case it

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.830 
down a half a note so in this case it
would<00:00:44.879> be<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.180> D<00:00:45.450> sharp

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
would be like a D sharp

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.119 
would be like a D sharp
type<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.010> go

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
type thing right and then you would go

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
type thing right and then you would go
to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> next<00:00:47.550> string<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.969> then<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> next

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to the next string and then the next

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
to the next string and then the next
string<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> half<00:00:49.289> note<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
string and go down a half note but I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.150 
string and go down a half note but I
find<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.969> easiest<00:00:51.000> way<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.750> do<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.129> put

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
find the easiest way to do it is to put

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
find the easiest way to do it is to put
a<00:00:53.340> capo<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> first<00:00:54.449> fret

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
a capo on the first fret

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
a capo on the first fret
get<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:55.980> close<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> frec

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
get it as close as you can to that frec

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
get it as close as you can to that frec
without<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.719> touching<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.469> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
without actually touching it and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.420 
without actually touching it and then
just<00:00:59.489> tune<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> regular<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> top<00:01:02.129> string

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
just tune it regular so the top string

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
just tune it regular so the top string
here<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> capo<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.359> first<00:01:03.570> fret<00:01:03.780> what

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
here with a capo on the first fret what

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.390 
here with a capo on the first fret what
game<00:01:04.170> would<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.619> E<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.280> be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
game would be your E and then will be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
game would be your E and then will be
your<00:01:08.520> day

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
