00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
electric constant of water and let's

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.319 
electric constant of water and let's
make<00:02:17.650> another<00:02:17.799> mistake<00:02:18.189> instead<00:02:18.969> of<00:02:19.060> changing

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
make another mistake instead of changing

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.539 
make another mistake instead of changing
solvents<00:02:20.049> let's<00:02:20.230> change<00:02:20.469> concentration<00:02:21.430> of

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
solvents let's change concentration of

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.990 
solvents let's change concentration of
ions<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.629> the<00:02:22.810> solvent<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.560> we've<00:02:23.680> got<00:02:23.799> six<00:02:24.430> KBT

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
ions in the solvent so we've got six KBT

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.440 
ions in the solvent so we've got six KBT
here

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
here

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.119 
here
let's<00:02:26.099> foolishly<00:02:27.099> make<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.519> one<00:02:27.760> molar<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
let's foolishly make this one molar and

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.640 
let's foolishly make this one molar and
you<00:02:30.129> see<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.700> we've<00:02:31.180> lost<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:32.019> lot<00:02:32.379> of<00:02:32.409> the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
you see that we've lost a lot of the

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.949 
you see that we've lost a lot of the
stabilization<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.269> charge

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
stabilization because the charge

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.830 
stabilization because the charge
I<00:02:34.989> ran<00:02:35.439> the<00:02:35.650> particle<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.310> now<00:02:36.760> hidden<00:02:37.269> by<00:02:37.780> this

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
I ran the particle is now hidden by this

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.199 
I ran the particle is now hidden by this
strong<00:02:38.530> concentration<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.609> it's<00:02:39.760> returned<00:02:40.060> it

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
strong concentration so it's returned it

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.160 
strong concentration so it's returned it
to<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.780> lower<00:02:41.439> strength<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.510> now<00:02:43.750> we<00:02:43.810> need<00:02:44.049> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
to a lower strength so now we need to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.129 
to a lower strength so now we need to
put<00:02:44.319> on<00:02:44.439> something<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.799> 50<00:02:45.250> millivolts<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
put on something like 50 millivolts and

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.319 
put on something like 50 millivolts and
when<00:02:47.139> we<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.409> a<00:02:47.439> 50<00:02:47.920> millivolt<00:02:48.400> z2<00:02:48.939> potential

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
when we have a 50 millivolt z2 potential

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.509 
when we have a 50 millivolt z2 potential
then<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.930> find<00:02:50.200> there's<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.769> strong<00:02:51.159> Debye

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
then we find there's is strong Debye

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.409 
then we find there's is strong Debye

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
it's fighting against the Vander vaults

Hammacher term the net result is that

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.509

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
we've got a barrier of greater than 25

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.210 
we've got a barrier of greater than 25
KBT<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.959> going<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.319> be<00:03:05.439> stable<00:03:05.889> in

suppose we can't have a high Phi then we

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.379 
suppose we can't have a high Phi then we

point four
nothing<00:04:27.629> happens<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.530> we<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.740> use<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.889> bad

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
nothing happens so we can use a bad

matter how bad the solvent is 0.49 still
nothing<00:04:36.090> happens<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.780> then<00:04:36.930> we<00:04:37.020> make<00:04:37.199> it

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
nothing happens and then we make it

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.129 
nothing happens and then we make it
point<00:04:37.500> 5<00:04:37.740> 1<00:04:38.419> because<00:04:39.419> we've<00:04:39.629> just<00:04:39.659> made<00:04:39.960> per

point 5 1 because we've just made per

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
solvent a little bit worse and now we

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.020 
solvent a little bit worse and now we

have stearic stabilization but we have
