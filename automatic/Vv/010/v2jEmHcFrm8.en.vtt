okay<00:00:06.189> doing<00:00:07.189> some<00:00:07.399> RP

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
okay doing some RP

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.430 
okay doing some RP
I'm<00:00:08.360> going<00:00:08.480> to<00:00:08.570> do<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:08.780> test<00:00:08.990> with<00:00:09.110> each<00:00:09.290> one

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
I'm going to do the test with each one

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.380 
I'm going to do the test with each one
of<00:00:09.560> the<00:00:09.650> engines<00:00:10.580> they<00:00:10.700> have<00:00:10.820> plans<00:00:11.090> available

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.390 
of the engines they have plans available

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.140 
of the engines they have plans available
for<00:00:12.100> this<00:00:13.100> is<00:00:13.220> the<00:00:13.309> first<00:00:13.550> test<00:00:13.820> we're<00:00:14.059> going

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
for this is the first test we're going

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.390 
for this is the first test we're going
to<00:00:14.240> do<00:00:14.360> with<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.540> copper<00:00:14.870> top<00:00:15.080> when<00:00:16.040> the<00:00:16.070> test

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
to do with the copper top when the test

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.650 
to do with the copper top when the test
is<00:00:16.460> going<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.670> be<00:00:16.730> at<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:16.850> lower<00:00:17.060> temp<00:00:17.420> I'm

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
is going to be at a lower temp I'm

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.660 
is going to be at a lower temp I'm
shooting<00:00:18.050> for<00:00:18.200> about<00:00:18.260> 250<00:00:18.800> but<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.250> burner<00:00:19.490> is

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
shooting for about 250 but the burner is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.000 
shooting for about 250 but the burner is
not<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.060> precise<00:00:20.480> kind<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.470> cycles<00:00:21.860> between

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
not so precise kind of cycles between

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.200 
not so precise kind of cycles between
about<00:00:22.340> 230<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.119> 270<00:00:24.579> check<00:00:25.579> our<00:00:25.759> temperature

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
about 230 and 270 check our temperature

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:40.020 
about 230 and 270 check our temperature
here<00:00:27.130> well<00:00:28.130> actually<00:00:28.550> we're<00:00:28.880> at<00:00:29.050> 253<00:00:30.050> so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.759 

so<00:00:41.030> we're<00:00:41.329> looking<00:00:41.629> at<00:00:41.690> about<00:00:42.519> 141<00:00:43.519> at<00:00:44.769> 250

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
so we're looking at about 141 at 250

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:51.369 
so we're looking at about 141 at 250
degrees<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.609> copper<00:00:46.879> tile<00:00:50.379> therming

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
degrees for the copper tile therming

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.220 
degrees for the copper tile therming
temperature<00:00:51.769> for<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.070> engine<00:00:52.460> is<00:00:52.550> closer<00:00:52.820> to

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
temperature for this engine is closer to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.369 
temperature for this engine is closer to
mmm

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
mmm

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.360 
mmm
200<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.399> 10<00:00:56.710> then<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.769> have<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.040> Phoenix

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
200 to 10 then we have the Phoenix

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.829 
200 to 10 then we have the Phoenix
engine<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:59.780> engine<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.379> probably<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
engine this engine is probably the

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.299 
engine this engine is probably the
easiest<00:01:02.839> starting<00:01:03.469> engine<00:01:03.769> of<00:01:03.890> mine

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
easiest starting engine of mine

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.389 
easiest starting engine of mine
starting<00:01:05.030> at<00:01:05.149> around<00:01:05.330> 150<00:01:06.200> degrees<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.220> that's

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
starting at around 150 degrees so that's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.450 
starting at around 150 degrees so that's
a<00:01:07.610> nice<00:01:08.210> little<00:01:08.240> temp<00:01:08.720> for<00:01:09.710> stovetop

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
a nice little temp for stovetop

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.889 
a nice little temp for stovetop
operation<00:01:11.470> hot<00:01:12.470> plate<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.130> currently<00:01:13.899> that's

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
operation hot plate is currently that's

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.790 
operation hot plate is currently that's
way<00:01:15.080> too<00:01:15.110> low

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.230 

like<00:01:18.800> Bob<00:01:19.039> 2:38<00:01:21.520> lower<00:01:22.520> temp<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.090> was

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
like Bob 2:38 lower temp that I was

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.710 
like Bob 2:38 lower temp that I was
looking<00:01:23.450> for<00:01:26.590> just<00:01:28.240> trying<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.360> get<00:01:29.479> them<00:01:29.630> all

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
looking for just trying to get them all

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.899 
looking for just trying to get them all
at<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.899> same<00:01:30.020> temperature<00:01:30.710> for<00:01:30.890> my<00:01:31.250> rpm

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
at the same temperature for my rpm

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.520 
at the same temperature for my rpm
measurement<00:01:36.280> but<00:01:37.280> we're<00:01:37.459> running<00:01:38.530> right

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
measurement but we're running right

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:51.490 
measurement but we're running right
around<00:01:39.649> 260<00:01:41.049> 166<00:01:42.049> rpm<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:45.430> right<00:01:46.430> about<00:01:50.500> 269

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.520 

here<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> original<00:02:03.840> beer<00:02:04.229> bottle

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
here we have the original beer bottle

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:22.980 
here we have the original beer bottle
engine<00:02:06.619> surface<00:02:07.619> temperature<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:10.190> 244

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:33.160 

looking<00:02:23.990> at<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> boat

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170

all<00:02:45.320> right<00:02:45.680> we<00:02:45.830> love<00:02:46.430> your<00:02:47.000> bottle<00:02:47.270> -<00:02:47.450> engine

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
all right we love your bottle - engine

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.250 
all right we love your bottle - engine
it<00:02:49.040> runs<00:02:49.280> really<00:02:49.460> good<00:02:49.760> now<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:52.990> added<00:02:53.990> in

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
it runs really good now that I added in

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.720 
it runs really good now that I added in
a<00:02:54.820> air<00:02:55.820> bypass<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.920> was<00:02:58.040> suctioning<00:02:58.520> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
a air bypass it was suctioning the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
starts around 175 degrees or so just

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.200 
starts around 175 degrees or so just
check<00:03:06.860> our<00:03:07.010> temperature<00:03:07.430> real<00:03:07.610> quick<00:03:09.040> more

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
check our temperature real quick more

I'm going to bring it up to 500 degrees

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.580 
I'm going to bring it up to 500 degrees
they'll<00:03:44.240> test<00:03:44.480> each<00:03:44.690> one<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.050> engines<00:03:45.440> at

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
they'll test each one of the engines at

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
with that fivepence

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.670 
with that fivepence
I<00:04:00.350> said<00:04:00.650> that<00:04:00.800> already

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.679 

we're<00:04:06.459> running<00:04:06.819> right<00:04:07.060> about<00:04:08.099> 328<00:04:09.450> which<00:04:10.450> is<00:04:10.659> a

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:10.689 
we're running right about 328 which is a

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.660 
we're running right about 328 which is a
bit<00:04:10.989> lower<00:04:11.200> than<00:04:11.319> last<00:04:11.620> time<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:12.040> tested<00:04:12.489> this

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
bit lower than last time I tested this

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.369 
bit lower than last time I tested this
there's<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.209> few<00:04:13.390> things<00:04:13.599> I<00:04:13.689> wanted<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.930> test<00:04:14.200> I

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
there's a few things I wanted to test I

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.869 
there's a few things I wanted to test I
wanted<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.620> go<00:04:14.739> back<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.159> piston<00:04:15.549> designer

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
wanted to go back to the piston designer

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.719 
wanted to go back to the piston designer
since<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.329> had<00:04:16.479> put<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.720> air<00:04:16.840> by<00:04:17.350> pass<00:04:17.590> on<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.160> was

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
since I had put the air by pass on I was

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.310 
since I had put the air by pass on I was
waiting<00:04:18.940> for<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.120> bell<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.449> fail<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.780> figured

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
waiting for the bell to fail I figured

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.439 
waiting for the bell to fail I figured
it<00:04:20.410> would<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:20.919> it's<00:04:21.310> not<00:04:21.519> I've<00:04:22.090> got<00:04:22.240> about<00:04:22.330> a

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
it would but it's not I've got about a

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.029 
it would but it's not I've got about a
hundred<00:04:22.600> hours<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:23.080> run<00:04:23.289> time<00:04:23.320> on<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.860> now

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
hundred hours of run time on it now

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.950 
hundred hours of run time on it now
that's<00:04:24.970> doing<00:04:25.750> just<00:04:25.960> fine<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:27.570> also<00:04:28.570> I<00:04:28.780> have

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
that's doing just fine so also I have

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.150 
that's doing just fine so also I have
the<00:04:29.400> bolts<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.520> displacer<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> made<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:32.160> wood

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
the bolts of displacer I made it's wood

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.189 
the bolts of displacer I made it's wood
with<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.370> hollow<00:04:33.610> inside<00:04:33.880> but<00:04:34.449> they<00:04:34.840> are<00:04:34.930> tight

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
with a hollow inside but they are tight

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.340 
with a hollow inside but they are tight
I<00:04:35.940> want<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.030> try<00:04:37.210> those<00:04:37.389> two<00:04:37.570> things<00:04:37.810> out<00:04:37.990> but

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.540 

still<00:04:41.350> we're<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.620> fight<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.190> we<00:04:42.310> have<00:04:42.430> the

still we're in the fight and we have the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
original beer bottle engine I'm sure is

faint<00:05:10.490> engine<00:05:10.990> or<00:05:11.990> should<00:05:12.710> be<00:05:12.740> pretty<00:05:13.040> close

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250

yes<00:05:19.220> that's<00:05:19.490> close<00:05:19.760> enough<00:05:23.110> laughs<00:05:24.110> gain<00:05:24.380> with

yes that's close enough laughs gain with

yes that's close enough laughs gain with
that<00:05:24.710> speed

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.070 

you<00:05:30.860> can<00:05:31.009> add<00:05:31.389> 439<00:05:34.479> this<00:05:35.479> one<00:05:35.659> runs<00:05:35.899> pretty

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
you can add 439 this one runs pretty

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.100 
you can add 439 this one runs pretty
good<00:05:36.199> at<00:05:37.099> high<00:05:37.969> and<00:05:38.240> low<00:05:38.360> temperatures<00:05:38.869> I

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
good at high and low temperatures I

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.820 
good at high and low temperatures I
guess<00:05:39.439> they<00:05:39.589> all<00:05:39.619> do<00:05:39.919> but<00:05:41.439> this<00:05:42.439> one<00:05:42.499> will<00:05:42.710> get

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
guess they all do but this one will get

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.820 
guess they all do but this one will get
a<00:05:42.860> bit<00:05:43.039> faster<00:05:43.689> typically<00:05:44.689> I<00:05:44.719> don't<00:05:44.869> take<00:05:45.259> try

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
a bit faster typically I don't take try

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.929 
a bit faster typically I don't take try
to<00:05:45.889> keep<00:05:46.069> the<00:05:46.219> temperature<00:05:46.369> of<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.729> stove

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509

that I run them on under 600 degrees
well<00:05:50.509> occasionally<00:05:50.779> it<00:05:51.080> gets<00:05:51.229> over<00:05:51.499> that<00:05:51.589> and

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.989
