and then I'll take the rest of it put it

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.310 
and then I'll take the rest of it put it
up<00:02:55.750> off<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.110> way<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:58.209> my<00:02:58.390> front<00:02:58.750> I'm<00:02:59.080> using

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
up off the way and in my front I'm using

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.760 
up off the way and in my front I'm using
two<00:02:59.830> strands<00:03:00.600> two<00:03:01.600> strands<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.170> thread<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.740> the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
two strands two strands of thread in the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.910 
two strands two strands of thread in the
back<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.250> used<00:03:03.550> three<00:03:04.000> strands<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.570> 3<00:03:04.870> i'll<00:03:05.590> take

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
back I used three strands of 3 i'll take

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.460 
back I used three strands of 3 i'll take
this<00:03:06.130> method<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.970> i'll<00:03:07.270> make<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.660> strands<00:03:08.140> go

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this method and i'll make the strands go

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.580 
this method and i'll make the strands go
over<00:03:08.830> each<00:03:08.860> other<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.580> way<00:03:09.820> if<00:03:10.780> y'all<00:03:11.410> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
over each other that way if y'all can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.080 
over each other that way if y'all can
see<00:03:11.769> what<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:12.310> doing<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.880> looks

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
see what it is I'm doing and it looks

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.259 
see what it is I'm doing and it looks
like<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.660> I'll<00:03:14.290> trying<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.850> loop<00:03:15.850> together

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
like this I'll trying to loop together

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.990 
like this I'll trying to loop together
and<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.019> take<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.500> ends<00:03:17.980> straighten<00:03:18.880> them

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
and you take the ends straighten them

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.970 
and you take the ends straighten them
out<00:03:19.239> maybe<00:03:19.930> pull<00:03:20.230> bow<00:03:20.410> for<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.709> together

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
out maybe pull bow for them together

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.520 
out maybe pull bow for them together
where<00:03:21.190> they<00:03:21.220> even<00:03:21.550> as<00:03:21.790> possible<00:03:22.420> then<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
where they even as possible then you

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.940 
where they even as possible then you
take<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.900> grab<00:03:25.900> up<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.110> hair<00:03:28.530> with<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.680> hair

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
take it grab up the hair with the hair

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.340 
take it grab up the hair with the hair
in<00:03:30.100> between<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.550> hands<00:03:30.820> like<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.350> route

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
in between the hands like that route

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.979 
in between the hands like that route
that<00:03:32.590> thread<00:03:32.950> around<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.670> here<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.810> way

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
that thread around that here that way

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.210 
that thread around that here that way
you<00:03:35.050> have<00:03:35.350> your<00:03:36.010> hair<00:03:36.370> and<00:03:37.170> also<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.560> yard<00:03:38.890> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
you have your hair and also the yard the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
you have your hair and also the yard the
two<00:03:39.430> strands<00:03:40.060> of<00:03:40.239> yarn<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:41.170> start

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
two strands of yarn and you just start

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.390 
two strands of yarn and you just start
going<00:03:43.780> through<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.860> just<00:03:45.070> start

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
going through it and you just start

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.080 
going through it and you just start
braiding<00:03:46.140> his<00:03:47.140> base<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.860> is<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.370> say<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:48.940> you

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
braiding his base it is is to say if you

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.570 
braiding his base it is is to say if you
know<00:03:49.269> how<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.450> do<00:03:49.780> single<00:03:50.320> braids<00:03:50.590> is<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.280> same

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
know how to do single braids is the same

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.870 
know how to do single braids is the same
way<00:03:51.940> then<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.260> comes<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.799> down<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.430> break

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
way then I just comes on down a break

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
way then I just comes on down a break
this<00:03:55.209> way<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:57.760> space<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.330> E<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.900> same<00:03:59.170> way

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
this way in space it E is the same way

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.460 
this way in space it E is the same way
as<00:03:59.739> if<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.489> are<00:04:00.820> single<00:04:01.420> braid<00:04:01.810> here<00:04:02.170> then

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
as if you are single braid here then

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.890 
as if you are single braid here then
once<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:02.890> get<00:04:03.100> to<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.370> end<00:04:03.549> of<00:04:03.730> your<00:04:03.970> hair<00:04:04.299> you

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
put like a piece of the yard with the

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.970 
put like a piece of the yard with the
end<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.209> hair<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:08.320> just<00:04:08.500> keep<00:04:08.739> on

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
end of the hair and you just keep on

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.940 
end of the hair and you just keep on
Brady<00:04:09.400> if<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:10.269> want<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.690> make<00:04:10.870> another<00:04:11.170> yarn

Brady if you want to make another yarn

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.460 
Brady if you want to make another yarn
to<00:04:12.310> go<00:04:12.489> over<00:04:12.820> there<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.049> can

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
to go over there then you can

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.410 
to go over there then you can
that<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.430> then<00:04:15.520> you<00:04:15.670> have<00:04:15.940> like<00:04:15.970> two

pieces of yarn with that piece of hair

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.220 
pieces of yarn with that piece of hair
of<00:04:20.140> yours<00:04:20.700> see<00:04:21.700> two<00:04:22.000> pieces<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.480> yarn<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.050> then

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
of yours see two pieces of yarn and then

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.420 
of yours see two pieces of yarn and then
you<00:04:23.350> just<00:04:23.560> spray<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.860> on<00:04:24.070> down<00:04:24.480> then<00:04:25.480> once<00:04:25.840> you

braid as fast as I can without this yard

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.900 
braid as fast as I can without this yard
and<00:04:52.750> also<00:04:53.140> make<00:04:53.380> sure<00:04:53.410> once<00:04:53.890> you're<00:04:54.130> braiding

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
and also make sure once you're braiding

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.570 
and also make sure once you're braiding
it<00:04:55.210> through<00:04:55.750> like<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.290> that<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:56.920> are<00:04:57.190> going

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
it through like this that you are going

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.480 
it through like this that you are going
all<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.900> way<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.110> know<00:04:59.590> down<00:04:59.890> and<00:05:00.250> it
