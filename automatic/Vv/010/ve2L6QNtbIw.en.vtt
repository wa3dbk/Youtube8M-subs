00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.850 
heavy and hardly no wind so I'm really
happy<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.760> cast<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:14.080> real<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.500> slow

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
happy with that cast the real is slow

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.390 
happy with that cast the real is slow
it's<00:03:15.850> got<00:03:16.000> all<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.240> bearings<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:18.100> think

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it's got all the bearings and I think

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.240 
it's got all the bearings and I think
what<00:03:18.550> some<00:03:18.700> tweaking<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.330> real<00:03:19.570> could<00:03:19.840> be

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
what some tweaking that real could be

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.220 
what some tweaking that real could be
very<00:03:21.250> effective<00:03:21.760> we<00:03:22.450> tournament<00:03:22.840> real<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.080> one

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
very effective we tournament real is one

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.500 
very effective we tournament real is one

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
as far as an initial balance is the zero
