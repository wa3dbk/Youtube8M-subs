despite<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:56.759> troubles<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.140> should

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
despite these troubles just as we should

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.840 
despite these troubles just as we should
as<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.189> through<00:01:59.460> life

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.780 

Oh<00:02:01.990> God<00:02:03.350> anyway<00:02:03.920> let's<00:02:04.189> let's<00:02:04.490> head<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.640> back

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
Oh God anyway let's let's head on back

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.820 
Oh God anyway let's let's head on back
to<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.330> crafting<00:02:05.900> bench<00:02:05.990> inside<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.710> our

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
to the crafting bench inside of our

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.160 
to the crafting bench inside of our
heads<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.280> let's<00:02:08.060> make<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.240> paintbrush<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
heads and let's make a paintbrush of a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.970 
heads and let's make a paintbrush of a
different<00:02:09.470> color<00:02:09.759> say<00:02:10.780> blue<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.410> provides<00:02:12.830> a

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
different color say blue that provides a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.650 
different color say blue that provides a
nice<00:02:13.100> contrast<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> red<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.330> were<00:02:14.450> using

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
nice contrast to the red we were using

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.010 
nice contrast to the red we were using
and<00:02:15.730> from<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:16.940> let's<00:02:17.180> head<00:02:17.480> on<00:02:17.510> over<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
and from there let's head on over to the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.240 
and from there let's head on over to the
canvas<00:02:18.340> next<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.459> us<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.020> oh<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.709> don't<00:02:21.920> know

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
canvas next to us and oh I don't know

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.150 
canvas next to us and oh I don't know
we'll<00:02:22.459> draw<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> smiley<00:02:24.290> face<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.770> something

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
we'll draw a smiley face with something

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.530 
we'll draw a smiley face with something
very<00:02:25.510> very<00:02:26.510> large

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.750 

now<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.569> actually<00:02:32.840> see<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.800> I<00:02:34.069> drifted

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
now I actually see that I I drifted

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.180 
now I actually see that I I drifted
outside<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> lines<00:02:35.930> here<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.530> don't

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
outside of the lines here and I don't

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
outside of the lines here and I don't
particularly<00:02:37.610> like<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.050> can<00:02:39.170> go

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
particularly like that so you can go

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.120 
particularly like that so you can go
ahead<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.269> we<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.660> craft<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.350> paint

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
ahead and do is we can craft a paint

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.370 
ahead and do is we can craft a paint
chipper<00:02:43.519> now<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.630> does<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.170> serves

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
chipper now what this does is it serves

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.340 
chipper now what this does is it serves
a<00:02:45.560> sort<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.860> an<00:02:45.980> eraser<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:47.300> allows<00:02:47.569> us<00:02:47.600> to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
a sort of an eraser and it allows us to

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.590 
a sort of an eraser and it allows us to
go<00:02:48.650> back<00:02:48.830> over<00:02:48.860> what<00:02:49.310> we've<00:02:49.489> done<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:49.970> we

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
go back over what we've done if we

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.470 
go back over what we've done if we
perhaps<00:02:51.220> don't<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:52.400> it's<00:02:52.640> we<00:02:53.269> made<00:02:53.450> a

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
perhaps don't like it's we made a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.900 
perhaps don't like it's we made a
boo-boo<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.560> case<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.040> we<00:02:55.549> can<00:02:55.580> go<00:02:55.790> ahead

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
boo-boo in this case and we can go ahead

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.050 
boo-boo in this case and we can go ahead
and<00:02:56.239> fix<00:02:56.569> our<00:02:56.750> mistakes<00:02:57.340> so<00:02:58.340> there<00:02:58.489> we<00:02:58.580> go

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and fix our mistakes so there we go

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.229 
and fix our mistakes so there we go
all<00:02:59.450> nice<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.049> back<00:03:01.040> inside<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.670> canvas<00:03:01.880> so

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
all nice and back inside the canvas so

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.309 
all nice and back inside the canvas so
now<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.480> gonna<00:03:02.569> go<00:03:02.780> ahead<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.080> just<00:03:03.230> use

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
now I'm gonna go ahead and just use

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.310 
now I'm gonna go ahead and just use
toomanyitems<00:03:03.739> I'll<00:03:04.519> give<00:03:04.790> myself<00:03:05.000> all<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
toomanyitems I'll give myself all the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.190 
toomanyitems I'll give myself all the
colors<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:08.140> now<00:03:09.140> we'll<00:03:09.470> go<00:03:10.340> ahead<00:03:10.489> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
colors and now we'll go ahead and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.580 
colors and now we'll go ahead and
scribble<00:03:12.200> on<00:03:12.519> everything<00:03:13.519> because<00:03:14.360> it's<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
scribble on everything because it's the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.050 
scribble on everything because it's the
right<00:03:15.739> thing<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:16.070> do<00:03:16.190> why<00:03:16.700> not

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
right thing to do why not

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.740 
right thing to do why not
so<00:03:17.870> let's<00:03:18.019> decorate<00:03:18.650> our<00:03:19.220> Museum<00:03:19.880> thoroughly

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750

with<00:03:21.019> lots<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.790> abstract<00:03:22.790> art<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.620> make<00:03:24.620> it

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
with lots of abstract art and make it

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.039 
with lots of abstract art and make it
look<00:03:24.950> nice<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.650> lovely<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:28.329> if<00:03:29.329> Jackson

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
look nice and lovely as if Jackson

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.340 
look nice and lovely as if Jackson
Pollock<00:03:30.500> had<00:03:30.920> been<00:03:31.100> invited<00:03:31.579> and<00:03:32.109> ate<00:03:33.109> his

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
Pollock had been invited and ate his

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.470 
Pollock had been invited and ate his
heart<00:03:33.530> outs<00:03:33.799> and<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.489> yellow<00:03:34.790> paintbrush<00:03:35.299> is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
heart outs and the yellow paintbrush is

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.080 
heart outs and the yellow paintbrush is
apparently<00:03:35.930> erasing<00:03:36.530> my<00:03:36.680> marks<00:03:37.070> so<00:03:37.910> that's

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
apparently erasing my marks so that's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.960 
apparently erasing my marks so that's
interesting<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:42.049> we<00:03:42.980> shall<00:03:43.160> continue<00:03:43.370> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
interesting and we shall continue and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.750 
interesting and we shall continue and
erase<00:03:44.870> outside<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.890> lines<00:03:46.130> we<00:03:46.430> don't<00:03:46.609> want

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
erase outside the lines we don't want

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.930 
erase outside the lines we don't want
that<00:03:50.769> looks<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:51.980> wonderful<00:03:52.160> does<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.790> not

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
that looks so wonderful does it not

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.210 
that looks so wonderful does it not
let's<00:03:53.870> put<00:03:54.079> some<00:03:54.230> green<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.620> white<00:03:54.859> that'll

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
let's put some green on white that'll

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.130 
let's put some green on white that'll
provide<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.549> nice<00:03:55.760> contrast<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.630> what<00:03:56.780> we<00:03:56.810> had

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
provide a nice contrast to what we had

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.490 
provide a nice contrast to what we had
before<00:03:58.299> do<00:03:59.299> we<00:03:59.420> have<00:03:59.540> any<00:03:59.690> more<00:03:59.810> colors<00:04:00.170> we<00:04:00.319> can

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
before do we have any more colors we can

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.349 
before do we have any more colors we can
use<00:04:02.200> hmm<00:04:03.200> looks<00:04:04.100> like<00:04:04.160> we've<00:04:04.430> used<00:04:04.670> up<00:04:04.819> just

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
use hmm looks like we've used up just

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.930 
use hmm looks like we've used up just
about<00:04:05.630> all<00:04:05.900> we<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.319> in<00:04:06.590> terms<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.250> colors

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.180 

and<00:04:10.750> it'll<00:04:10.960> splatter<00:04:11.230> over<00:04:11.620> one<00:04:11.800> more<00:04:11.950> image

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
and it'll splatter over one more image

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.570 
and it'll splatter over one more image
and<00:04:12.700> then<00:04:13.380> well<00:04:14.380> would<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.680> look<00:04:14.830> at<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.010> it

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
and then well would you look at that it

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.390 
and then well would you look at that it
appears<00:04:15.910> we<00:04:16.090> have<00:04:16.120> ourselves<00:04:16.480> a<00:04:17.019> regular

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
appears we have ourselves a regular

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.660 
appears we have ourselves a regular
Museum<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.580> Modern<00:04:19.540> Art<00:04:19.870> Andy<00:04:20.650> Warhol<00:04:21.040> eat

your<00:04:22.000> heart<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.890> realize<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.370> the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
your heart out and I realize I think the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.760 
your heart out and I realize I think the
reason<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.720> yellow<00:04:26.080> paintbrush<00:04:26.530> was

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
reason that the yellow paintbrush was

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.890 
reason that the yellow paintbrush was
actually<00:04:27.250> erasing<00:04:27.730> paints<00:04:28.240> up<00:04:28.450> there<00:04:28.690> was

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
actually erasing paints up there was

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.380 
actually erasing paints up there was
because<00:04:29.230> I<00:04:29.260> went<00:04:30.040> into<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.610> paint<00:04:30.970> chipper

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
because I went into the paint chipper

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.940 
because I went into the paint chipper
section<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.170> too<00:04:32.290> many<00:04:32.470> items<00:04:32.770> without

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
section of too many items without

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.190 
section of too many items without
realizing<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.910> grabbed<00:04:34.660> one<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
realizing it and grabbed one of the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.310 
realizing it and grabbed one of the
colored<00:04:35.950> paint<00:04:36.640> chippers<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.050> would<00:04:38.170> be

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
colored paint chippers so that would be

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.590 
colored paint chippers so that would be
an<00:04:38.410> explanation<00:04:38.710> anyway<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.730> guess<00:04:40.390> that's

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
an explanation anyway I guess that's

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.480 
an explanation anyway I guess that's
