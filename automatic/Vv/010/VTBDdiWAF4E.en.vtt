00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
 about this theme 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.609
 there is very optimistic 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.869
 Antonio Díaz Alperi Titanic Coli 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.730
 Olivas I want to detail the steps that I follow when I get up and take me to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.949
 makeup as they still exist in pajamas 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.019
 I want to teach what are the cares of the morning before the 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.489
 makeup 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.489
 all we need is a toothpaste 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.280
 a tonic 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 a moisturizer 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.790
 and a sunscreen 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.740
 First and foremost of everything 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.230
 go to the bathroom 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.420
 and brush the teeth 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.360
 I am using the second string 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 the advanced bleach 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.260
 we continue in the bathroom now wash your face with soap and water 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.010
 and we already started with cosmetic products 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.680
 I'm going to throw my tonic first of all to clean the pores that have 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.720
 added during the night 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.289
 I am desiring that the nuclear climate 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.560
 the black spot cleaner tonic 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.400
 equal and for it I take something caught this so big that you see 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.290
 the manager of ica lugo 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590
 I bought it in eroski 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.590
 we chat in a clean tito tree 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.750
 and we started to apply 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
 the tonic all over the skin especially considering 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.070
 this for example that has a lot of alcohol 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.540
 the declining already 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.130
 that we can not apply it on the eyes, however, when I used this plus 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.840
 the facial tonic is normal as it is for all skin types and has hardly 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 alcohol yes he used it on the eyelid although it is not recommended 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.320
 so good we apply especially incidiendo in the area d the Christmas 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.320
 speed and voice that also leave some black dots 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
 and the forehead 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.029
 and of course the last pass after cleaning our skin as hydrate the 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.909
 I do it with simplicity with the moisturizer and the fierceness and that is 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.469
 city ​​water 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.579
 and I'm doing very well with abnormal texture and gel texture 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.809
 this general structure 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 for normal and combined activities 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.449
 in Spain 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.729
 scratch the other cream talked about a normal one 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.799
 that's for drier dry skin than very dry 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.529
 so it goes beyond 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.849
 I take a little of the product 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.849
 and applied 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.289
 and circular movements 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.289
 down this part 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:17.029
 very happy 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.999
 and on the forehead 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 in circles too and towards him 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.079
 and now what I do is take a little more 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.369
 and west point 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.369

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:52.159
 well up here the steps or is not science laws clean the skin the 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.279

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:57.559
 and now how am I going to go out to Libya street to be all day outside locke 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:58.659
 something 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.340
 is also to use a sunscreen because the simplicity does not have 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.339
 protectors the only thing I do not like but it's great 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:11.959
 so what I use is the amount of deliplus sd facial sunscreen and 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:12.889
 have 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.889
 eva some asset protection account 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.239

 Sober face to face do not have to take a lot of quantity with this we have enough 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.850
 incising in the areas where more in 11 2 l burn the face for me are wolf 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.199
 bangs 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.279
 and the forehead must always be protected 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.199
 and that's it, we're all ready and prepared for the whole day 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.719
 the ladies in other allies 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.569
 and while there is a bench 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.569
