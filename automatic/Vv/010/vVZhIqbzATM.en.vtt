both phones and so we have a clear
memory<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:20.279> let's<00:00:20.580> see<00:00:20.820> how<00:00:21.390> fast<00:00:21.840> both<00:00:22.590> can

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
memory and let's see how fast both can

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.679 
memory and let's see how fast both can
reboot<00:00:23.760> first<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> yeah<00:00:26.699> unless<00:00:27.060> back<00:00:27.390> side

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
reboot first so yeah unless back side

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.250 
reboot first so yeah unless back side
we've<00:00:28.019> got<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.670> 5.2<00:00:29.670> inch<00:00:29.849> display<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> LG

regular galaxy s4 international it also

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.540 
regular galaxy s4 international it also
you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:50.750> g2<00:00:51.949> rebooted<00:00:52.949> quite

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you can see that the g2 rebooted quite

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.479 
you can see that the g2 rebooted quite
quickly<00:00:54.530> definitely<00:00:55.530> faster<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
quickly definitely faster than the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.560 
quickly definitely faster than the
samsung<00:00:56.910> galaxy<00:00:56.940> s4<00:00:57.809> we've<00:00:58.590> got<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> five<00:00:59.070> inch

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570

and<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.840> memory<00:01:07.200> must<00:01:07.619> be

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and so now you see the memory must be

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
and so now you see the memory must be
completely<00:01:09.260> blank<00:01:10.260> we've<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.520> data

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
completely blank we've got no data

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
it has a Snapdragon 600 CPU with I think

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.160 
it has a Snapdragon 600 CPU with I think
four<00:01:48.479> times<00:01:48.890> 1.9<00:01:49.890> gigahertz<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.020> also

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
four times 1.9 gigahertz you can also

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.249 
four times 1.9 gigahertz you can also
get<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:52.619> an<00:01:52.740> octa-core<00:01:53.130> version<00:01:53.640> which<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
get with an octa-core version which is

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.639 
get with an octa-core version which is
Samsung's<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.680> own<00:01:56.090> Exynos<00:01:57.090> CPU<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Samsung's very own Exynos CPU but is the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.590 
Samsung's very own Exynos CPU but is the

which<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.079> also<00:02:01.820> yeah<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.270> widespread<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
which is also yeah more widespread so

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.139 
which is also yeah more widespread so
you<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.680> vg2<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:06.439> finished<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.849> let's<00:02:08.849> see

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you see vg2 is finished and let's see

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.500 
you see vg2 is finished and let's see
we've<00:02:09.330> got

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.970 

eighteen<00:02:12.510> thousand<00:02:13.200> seven<00:02:13.560> hundred<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
eighteen thousand seven hundred and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.270 
eighteen thousand seven hundred and
seventy<00:02:14.549> points<00:02:14.790> which<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.290> lot<00:02:16.829> more<00:02:16.859> than

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
seventy points which is a lot more than

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.289 
seventy points which is a lot more than
v1x<00:02:17.969> yeah<00:02:18.540> sure<00:02:19.340> vcpu<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.579> definitely<00:02:21.090> faster

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
v1x yeah sure vcpu is definitely faster

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.280 
v1x yeah sure vcpu is definitely faster
and<00:02:21.749> we've<00:02:22.379> got<00:02:22.650> ten<00:02:23.400> thousand<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.389> thirty

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
and we've got ten thousand and thirty

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.449 
and we've got ten thousand and thirty
one<00:02:25.590> point<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.999> samsung<00:02:27.450> galaxy<00:02:27.650> s4<00:02:28.650> so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
one point on the samsung galaxy s4 so

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.220 
one point on the samsung galaxy s4 so
you<00:02:29.519> see<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.000> difference<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.659> definitely

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
you see the difference is definitely

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.390 
you see the difference is definitely
noticeable<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.609> benchmarks<00:02:33.299> which<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:35.010> of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
noticeable in the benchmarks which is of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.240 
noticeable in the benchmarks which is of
course<00:02:36.030> clear<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:37.019> CPU<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.650> vg2<00:02:38.129> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
course clear the CPU on vg2 is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.159 
course clear the CPU on vg2 is
definitely<00:02:38.700> faster<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:39.349> and<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.799> do<00:02:41.870> let's<00:02:42.870> go

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
definitely faster so and to do let's go

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:47.179 
definitely faster so and to do let's go
where<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.239> go<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.620> apps<00:02:46.859> also

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
where is it there you go so apps also

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.140 
where is it there you go so apps also
start<00:02:47.669> up<00:02:47.849> on<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> g-tube<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.780> bit<00:02:49.109> faster

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
start up on the g-tube a bit faster

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.970 
start up on the g-tube a bit faster
nothing<00:02:51.150> too<00:02:51.329> noticeable<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.139> you<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.469> okay

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
nothing too noticeable but you see okay

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.539 
nothing too noticeable but you see okay
we<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.639> tests<00:02:54.030> running<00:02:54.299> here<00:02:54.689> already

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
we have the tests running here already

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:04.060 
we have the tests running here already
now<00:02:56.549> let's<00:02:56.939> test<00:02:58.639> yes<00:02:59.639> everything

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.620 

so<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.640> same<00:03:05.880> version<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.360> into

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
so you see it's the same version of into

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:17.600 
so you see it's the same version of into
24<00:03:07.290> n<00:03:07.500> dot<00:03:08.280> 0<00:03:09.180> dot<00:03:09.210> 1<00:03:16.100> also<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.190> can<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.490> we

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
24 n dot 0 dot 1 also you can see we

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.540 
24 n dot 0 dot 1 also you can see we
display<00:03:18.090> different<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.930> V<00:03:19.560> GTO<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.250> bit

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
display different so V GTO is a bit

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.520 
display different so V GTO is a bit
higher<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:22.440> also<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.800> bit<00:03:22.980> wider<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:25.320> of

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
higher and also a bit wider and of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.450 
higher and also a bit wider and of
course<00:03:25.800> with<00:03:26.040> blacks<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.850> s4<00:03:27.000> are<00:03:28.460> more

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
course with blacks on the s4 are more

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.990 
course with blacks on the s4 are more
deeper<00:03:29.880> whereas<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.930> IPS<00:03:31.320> panel<00:03:31.680> still<00:03:32.610> has

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
deeper whereas the IPS panel still has

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.590 
deeper whereas the IPS panel still has
well<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.900> wouldn't<00:03:34.500> call<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.890> problems<00:03:35.490> but<00:03:35.820> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
well I wouldn't call it problems but it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.070 
well I wouldn't call it problems but it
doesn't<00:03:36.990> look<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.140> good<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:39.570> black<00:03:39.810> side

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
doesn't look that good on the black side

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.370 
doesn't look that good on the black side
on<00:03:40.440> vg2<00:03:40.920> as<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.490> galaxy<00:03:41.910> s4<00:03:42.210> but<00:03:42.840> still<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
on vg2 as on the galaxy s4 but still the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.050 
on vg2 as on the galaxy s4 but still the
display<00:03:43.710> on<00:03:43.740> with<00:03:43.950> g2<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.430> definitely

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
display on with g2 is definitely

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:54.670 
display on with g2 is definitely
phenomenal<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.990> very<00:03:46.440> beautiful

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.890 

you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.229 

so<00:04:00.900> v<00:04:01.079> LG<00:04:01.530> g2<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.250> finished<00:04:03.000> with<00:04:04.189> 32,000<00:04:05.239> 329

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
so v LG g2 is finished with 32,000 329

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.500 
so v LG g2 is finished with 32,000 329
points<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:07.439> definitely<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.129> leader<00:04:08.510> galaxy

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
points it's definitely a leader galaxy

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.440 
points it's definitely a leader galaxy
s4<00:04:09.840> has<00:04:10.250> 27<00:04:11.250> thousand<00:04:11.819> eight<00:04:11.939> hundred<00:04:11.970> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
s4 has 27 thousand eight hundred and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.869 
s4 has 27 thousand eight hundred and
seventy<00:04:13.019> four<00:04:13.319> points<00:04:13.709> which<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.370> also<00:04:14.730> very

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
seventy four points which is also very

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.379 
seventy four points which is also very
good<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:16.009> but<00:04:17.009> it's<00:04:17.160> still<00:04:17.370> five<00:04:17.699> thousand

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
good and but it's still five thousand

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.949 
good and but it's still five thousand
points<00:04:18.570> less<00:04:19.019> so<00:04:20.000> let's<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.269> where<00:04:21.690> did<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
points less so let's see where did it

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.529 
points less so let's see where did it
win<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:24.030> we<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:25.580> multitasking<00:04:26.580> performances

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
win so we have multitasking performances

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.050 
win so we have multitasking performances
more<00:04:27.750> or<00:04:28.259> less<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.590> same<00:04:28.620> I'd<00:04:29.130> say<00:04:32.060> definitely

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
more or less the same I'd say definitely

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.110 
more or less the same I'd say definitely
