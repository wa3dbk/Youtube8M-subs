00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.299
 now time for mario kart 8 with yellow 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.400
 peel bananas 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.259
 why the mario kart 8 is back at 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.160
 evenings to fill and friendships for 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.349
 good to be told 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.480
 nintendo does for that matter where it 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.300
 well-known characters are mapped out 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.460
 put them on imaginative transportation 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.470
 times we can train against walls and 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.160
 just like the mario kart 7 our wings 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.200
 knock out 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.939
 after a big jump and the first one 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.820
 firing a new motionless wheel on us 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.019
 bio for a never to speak mario 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.160

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.050
 well that we just give it a go 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.089
 each other should remain clear where we 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.039
 so it was something last season 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.359
 return to battle are what bed 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.920
 dollars have a lot against each other 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.600
 fought 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.429

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.670

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.980
 child wants to win that each three times 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.080
 I should have done it twice 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.880
 okay for our well it is just 3 3 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.360
 battle of the law 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.040
 yes it would be 3 3 between us this season and 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.690
 so we still have one chance to get one 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.000
 to determine the winner and that I have this chance 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.000

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.340

 Mario Kart personally really has fun 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.330
 so no one who had mario kart no 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.820

 This course is new to the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.380
 Walls on travel budget really make you an onsen 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.030
 then you could grab shows through the wall 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.530

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.310

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.020
