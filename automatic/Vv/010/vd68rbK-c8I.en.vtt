00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
protein macros are I would say pretty

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.330 
protein macros are I would say pretty
standard<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.410> that's<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:31.740> great<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.219> me

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

we're thick honestly for a whey protein
it<00:02:13.050> came<00:02:13.170> out<00:02:13.320> really<00:02:13.560> thick<00:02:13.830> usually<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.790> use

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
it came out really thick usually I use

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.940 
it came out really thick usually I use
half<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> serving<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.720> cashew<00:02:16.380> milk<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.800> my

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
half a serving of cashew milk and my

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.340 
half a serving of cashew milk and my
proteins<00:02:17.400> don't<00:02:18.270> turn<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.930> thick<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
proteins don't turn out that thick I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.020 
proteins don't turn out that thick I
didn't<00:02:19.590> use<00:02:19.980> any<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:20.370> ice<00:02:20.520> than<00:02:20.550> usual

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
didn't use any more ice than usual

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:31.780 
didn't use any more ice than usual
either<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:22.020> let's<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.710> how<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.860> tastes

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.070 

it's<00:02:32.790> honestly<00:02:33.090> pretty<00:02:33.270> good<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.930> know<00:02:34.050> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
it's honestly pretty good you know I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's honestly pretty good you know I
mean<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.770> wouldn't<00:02:35.340> say<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:35.550> anything

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
mean like I wouldn't say it's anything

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.370 
mean like I wouldn't say it's anything
like<00:02:35.910> super<00:02:36.270> super<00:02:36.540> special<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:37.080> like<00:02:37.200> it's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
like super super special but like it's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.400 
like super super special but like it's
really<00:02:37.650> pretty<00:02:37.950> good<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.990> give<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.260> an<00:02:40.380> 8

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
really pretty good I would give it an 8

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.570 
really pretty good I would give it an 8
out<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.800> 10<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.570> as<00:02:42.570> far<00:02:42.810> as<00:02:42.900> taste<00:02:43.140> goes<00:02:43.580> I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
out of 10 for as far as taste goes I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.010 
out of 10 for as far as taste goes I
really<00:02:45.060> like<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.209> thickness<00:02:45.420> honestly<00:02:45.959> I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
really like the thickness honestly I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.690 
really like the thickness honestly I
really<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.410> mostly<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.130> only<00:02:47.459> get

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
really do mostly you kind of only get

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.380 
really do mostly you kind of only get
that<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.120> weight<00:02:49.050> concentrates<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.390> casing

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
that in weight concentrates and casing

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.030 
that in weight concentrates and casing
of<00:02:51.510> course<00:02:51.750> but<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.800> like<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
of course but I really like the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.890 
of course but I really like the
thickness<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.670> essence<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.450> versatile

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
thickness and essence it's so versatile

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.180 
thickness and essence it's so versatile
it's<00:02:55.020> weight<00:02:55.230> filter<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:55.830> much<00:02:55.950> anything

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it's weight filter pretty much anything

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.000 
it's weight filter pretty much anything
I'm<00:02:57.120> also<00:02:57.300> really<00:02:57.930> impressed<00:02:58.230> by<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.500> amino

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
I'm also really impressed by the amino

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.880 
I'm also really impressed by the amino
acid<00:02:59.370> profile<00:03:00.320> usually<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.380> don't<00:03:01.470> see<00:03:01.709> that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
acid profile usually you don't see that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.979 
acid profile usually you don't see that
much<00:03:02.070> found<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.670> protein<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.270> also<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.840> has

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
much found in a protein and also it has

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:04.820 
much found in a protein and also it has
bromelain

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
bromelain

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.690 
bromelain
which<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.670> great<00:03:05.970> digestive<00:03:06.930> enzyme<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.070> I

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
which is great digestive enzyme so I

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.340 
which is great digestive enzyme so I
always<00:03:09.060> like<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.360> give<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.780> digestive

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
always like to give more digestive

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.670 
always like to give more digestive
enzymes<00:03:10.680> in<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.040> that's<00:03:11.160> an<00:03:11.280> easy<00:03:11.400> way<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:12.180> I'm

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
enzymes in and that's an easy way so I'm

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.840 
enzymes in and that's an easy way so I'm
really<00:03:13.680> enjoy<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.100> protein<00:03:14.400> guys<00:03:14.580> I'm

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
really enjoy this protein guys I'm

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.340 
really enjoy this protein guys I'm
probably<00:03:15.150> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> buy<00:03:15.540> more<00:03:15.750> actually<00:03:16.200> it's

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
probably going to buy more actually it's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.420 
probably going to buy more actually it's
super<00:03:16.709> good<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:18.150> also<00:03:18.690> got<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> free<00:03:19.430> for

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
super good and I also got a free for

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
through body length comm and I bought

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.750 
through body length comm and I bought
this<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.380> got<00:03:25.620> chocolate<00:03:26.280> chocolate<00:03:26.580> chip
