00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.009 

when<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.850> first<00:00:51.059> pulled<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.629> machine

when we first pulled up to this machine

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.479 
when we first pulled up to this machine
it<00:00:52.199> definitely<00:00:52.590> threw<00:00:52.620> us<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.340> bit

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it definitely threw us for a little bit

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
it definitely threw us for a little bit
of<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> loop<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:54.899> especially<00:00:55.230> because

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
of a loop and me especially because

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.319 
of a loop and me especially because
first<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.609> all<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.850> something<00:00:57.089> like<00:00:57.120> you've

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
first of all it's something like you've

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
first of all it's something like you've
never<00:00:57.449> seen<00:00:57.690> before<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.230> one-seater

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
never seen before a one-seater
side-by-side<00:00:59.640> reminds<00:01:00.449> me<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.809> odyssey

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

back<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> day<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.909> it's<00:01:03.269> actually

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
back in the day but it's actually

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.469 
back in the day but it's actually
surprising<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.710> does<00:01:04.949> drive<00:01:05.759> really

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
surprising because it does drive really

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050 
surprising because it does drive really
well<00:01:06.690> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.649> really<00:01:07.830> neat<00:01:08.130> vehicle<00:01:08.580> first

and foremost because it creates a cool

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.249 
and foremost because it creates a cool
new<00:01:11.090> segment<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> off-road<00:01:12.840> industry

new segment for the off-road industry

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.770 
new segment for the off-road industry
being<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.820> beginner<00:01:15.270> vehicle

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
being that it's a beginner vehicle

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
being that it's a beginner vehicle
that's<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.320> aimed<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.030> accomplish<00:01:18.030> is
