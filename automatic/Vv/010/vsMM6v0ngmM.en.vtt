00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:20.660
 hello so repair bumper 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.090
 way number 2 and so here is not enough 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 piece of bumper 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:38.180
 look like on this side u need it 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:41.870
 here to attach for a start I prune 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 damaged place then it will not be easier 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.960
 I have customized parts from 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 other bumper 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 he puts this whole piece 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 trimmed part and 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.440
 then outline the contour 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.180
 I cut this part and I will be there 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.680
 insert 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 so cut the circuit 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:34.160
 cut 2 by tags and try on everything 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160
 fits 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:42.159
 stapler in several places fix 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.159
 two parts 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 so 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.960
 shot stapler 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.880
 and now you can weld 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:06.180
 so take in the hands of such a device 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:11.790
 sold in any household any 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:18.510
 store from the same bumper cut off 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 an electron and began to solder here the main thing 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 so as not to set fire to plastic so that it does not 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.660
 burned otherwise cooked will be bad 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.660
 just stick 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:52.700
 dumping around the seam 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.700
 from the inside I'll be drinking on my face 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:37.790
 when cooked now outside 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.790
 by the same pro going on you 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.310
 I'm so comfortable some cook 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:55.850
 but I clean the shock first bolt 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.850
 grinder number 40 on the hand machine 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.180
 but that I also repair this bumper 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:27.490
 it remains only to putty and paint 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:31.010
