you've<00:00:23.070> seen<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.550> design<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> past<00:00:24.750> as

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
you've seen this design in the past as

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
you've seen this design in the past as
it's<00:00:26.400> actually<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.119> effective<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.710> what

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's actually really effective but what

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's actually really effective but what
that<00:00:29.160> premise<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.179> you've<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.449> four

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720

the center and I'm going to show you
here<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> second<00:00:40.050> basically<00:00:40.469> you're<00:00:40.590> gonna

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
here in a second basically you're gonna

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030 
here in a second basically you're gonna
drop<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.780> three<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.290> four<00:00:43.559> jump<00:00:43.829> spells

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
drop down three of the four jump spells

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
drop down three of the four jump spells
right<00:00:44.280> away<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.700> drop<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.120> four<00:00:45.329> if

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
right away you can drop all four if

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.000 
right away you can drop all four if
you'd<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.809> particularly<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.649> maxed

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you'd like particularly if you're maxed

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.029 
you'd like particularly if you're maxed
out<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.840> spread<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.860> your

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
out and then you just spread out your

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.420 
out and then you just spread out your
golems<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.879> create<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> proper<00:00:51.629> funnel<00:00:52.430> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
golems to create the proper funnel and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
golems to create the proper funnel and
then<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> drop<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:53.969> Wiz<00:00:54.120> ease<00:00:54.300> behind<00:00:54.899> them

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
then you drop your Wiz ease behind them

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
then you drop your Wiz ease behind them
and<00:00:55.399> essentially<00:00:56.399> you've<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.670> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
and essentially you've got your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.720 
and essentially you've got your
offensive<00:00:57.360> line<00:00:58.219> protecting<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.579> your

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
offensive line protecting at your

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.299 
offensive line protecting at your
running<00:01:00.030> backs<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.829> march<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
running backs as you just march down the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
running backs as you just march down the
field<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.380> coming

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
field so as you can see there is coming

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
field so as you can see there is coming
right<00:01:08.130> through<00:01:08.159> right<00:01:08.990> now<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> inferno

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
right through right now the inferno

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820 
right through right now the inferno
tower<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.189> squarely<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.060> those<00:01:13.049> three<00:01:13.470> golems

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
tower is squarely on those three golems

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.940 
tower is squarely on those three golems
in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> center<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.320> it'd<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.530> ideal<00:01:18.650> if<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in the center and it'd be ideal if it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
in the center and it'd be ideal if it
hit<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> golems<00:01:20.909> however<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> does<00:01:21.450> get<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hit all the golems however it does get a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 
hit all the golems however it does get a
few<00:01:21.810> wizard<00:01:22.110> he's<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:23.369> its<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
few wizard he's on its way up and it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.929 
few wizard he's on its way up and it
makes<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.780> quick<00:01:25.049> work<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> withers

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
makes really quick work of the withers

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
makes really quick work of the withers
then<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> drop<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.390> rage<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> essentially

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
then you drop your rage and essentially

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.980 
then you drop your rage and essentially
your<00:01:28.950> royals<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.060> does<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.479> most<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
your royals are what does the most of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
your royals are what does the most of
the<00:01:31.049> jam<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> damage<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> center<00:01:32.670> now<00:01:33.360> if

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the jam it damage to the center now if

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.690 
the jam it damage to the center now if
you're<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:34.380> against<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> single<00:01:35.009> Inferno

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're going against a single Inferno

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.719 
you're going against a single Inferno
with<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.210> method<00:01:37.430> you're<00:01:38.430> gonna<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
with this method you're gonna have a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
with this method you're gonna have a
little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.210> trouble<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.439> because

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
little bit more trouble just because

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.440 
little bit more trouble just because
naturally<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> single<00:01:42.030> Inferno<00:01:42.270> tower

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
naturally what the single Inferno tower

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.710 
naturally what the single Inferno tower
does<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> always<00:01:44.220> want<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:45.360> careful

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
does and you always want to be careful

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
does and you always want to be careful
with<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:46.140> King<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> single<00:01:47.220> Inferno<00:01:47.670> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
with your King on a single Inferno be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.139 
with your King on a single Inferno be
careful<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.290> always<00:01:49.380> drop<00:01:49.770> him<00:01:49.979> later<00:01:50.369> than

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
careful and always drop him later than

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
careful and always drop him later than
the<00:01:51.299> rest<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:52.189> as<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.790> can

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the rest and as you can see you can

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
the rest and as you can see you can
little<00:01:54.090> there's<00:01:54.210> two<00:01:54.360> wizards<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> top

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little there's two wizards on the top

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.499 
little there's two wizards on the top
had<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.159> maybe<00:01:56.369> been<00:01:56.640> four<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.240> there

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
had there maybe been four up there

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.899 
had there maybe been four up there
instead<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> two<00:01:58.850> they'd<00:01:59.850> be

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
instead of just the two they'd be

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
instead of just the two they'd be
circling<00:02:00.420> around<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.840> top<00:02:01.140> side<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> little

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
circling around that top side a little

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.830 
circling around that top side a little
bit<00:02:02.070> faster

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
bit faster

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.649 
bit faster
so<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> maybe<00:02:04.680> take<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:05.540> one<00:02:06.540> or

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so if you do is maybe take out one or

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.609 
so if you do is maybe take out one or
two<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> wizards<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> center<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
two of the wizards in the center and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.420 
two of the wizards in the center and
like<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.739> might<00:02:10.890> give<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> chance<00:02:11.310> to
