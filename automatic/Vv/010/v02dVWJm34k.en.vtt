the gluten that helps bread to rise and
develop<00:02:33.920> bubbles<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.489> dump<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.790> into

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
develop bubbles you just dump that into

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.349 
develop bubbles you just dump that into
and<00:02:35.629> you<00:02:35.930> briefly<00:02:36.409> whisk<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:36.950> around<00:02:37.359> and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
in four cups of water it's lukewarm

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.009 
in four cups of water it's lukewarm
water<00:02:42.799> if<00:02:43.609> it<00:02:43.790> wasn't<00:02:44.150> lukewarm<00:02:44.540> water<00:02:44.629> it

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
water if it wasn't lukewarm water it

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.599 
water if it wasn't lukewarm water it
would<00:02:45.139> take<00:02:45.319> longer<00:02:45.530> than<00:02:45.799> two<00:02:45.859> hours<00:02:46.040> if<00:02:46.489> it's

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609

would take longer than two hours if it's
lukewarm<00:02:46.849> just<00:02:47.299> put<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.599> little<00:02:47.870> warm<00:02:48.079> to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
lukewarm just put it a little warm to

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
touch and I'm gonna mix that with a

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.360 
touch and I'm gonna mix that with a
spoon<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.810> what<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.349> see<00:02:51.530> I've<00:02:51.680> got<00:02:51.919> here<00:02:52.220> is

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
spoon and what you see I've got here is

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.170 
spoon and what you see I've got here is
a<00:02:52.790> wet<00:02:53.239> dough<00:02:53.450> I'm<00:02:54.049> gonna<00:02:54.260> cover<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.709> loosely

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
a wet dough I'm gonna cover it loosely

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.909 
a wet dough I'm gonna cover it loosely
maybe<00:02:56.180> snap<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.720> down<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:57.379> open<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.859> a

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
maybe snap it down and then open it a

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.979 
maybe snap it down and then open it a
bit<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.280> gas<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.790> come<00:02:58.970> out<00:02:59.120> stays<00:02:59.569> for<00:02:59.810> two

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
bit so gas can come out stays for two

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.599 
bit so gas can come out stays for two
hours<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.500> counter<00:03:00.859> it's<00:03:01.159> gonna<00:03:01.310> rise

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
hours on the counter it's gonna rise

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.159 
hours on the counter it's gonna rise
quite<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.060> lot<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.480> then<00:03:02.720> it's<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.019> go

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
quite a lot and then it's going to go

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.319 
quite a lot and then it's going to go
into<00:03:03.439> the<00:03:03.560> refrigerator<00:03:03.739> now<00:03:04.519> remember<00:03:05.090> I've
