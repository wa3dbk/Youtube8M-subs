so<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:01.949> want<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.280> talk<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:03.030> block<00:00:03.600> start

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
so I want to talk about this block start

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.190 
so I want to talk about this block start
here<00:00:04.290> here's<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.560> great<00:00:04.799> example<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:06.200> coming

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
here here's a great example of coming

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.350 
here here's a great example of coming
out<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.440> starting<00:00:07.799> blocks<00:00:08.210> one<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
out of the starting blocks one of the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.020 
out of the starting blocks one of the
first<00:00:09.570> things<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.929> can<00:00:10.110> look<00:00:10.260> at<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:11.030> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
first things you can look at is the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.709 
first things you can look at is the
angle<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.590> power<00:00:14.099> leg<00:00:14.549> should<00:00:15.330> be<00:00:15.389> about

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
angle of the power leg should be about

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.800 
angle of the power leg should be about
45<00:00:16.230> degree<00:00:16.619> angle<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.940> can

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
45 degree angle which it is here you can

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.210 
45 degree angle which it is here you can
adjust<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.380> whatever's<00:00:20.039> more

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
adjust that to whatever's more

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.560 
adjust that to whatever's more
comfortable<00:00:20.250> if<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.000> want<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
comfortable if you want it to be a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.390 
comfortable if you want it to be a
little<00:00:21.779> less<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.080> an<00:00:22.199> angle<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:23.189> more

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
little less of an angle to get more

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.660 
little less of an angle to get more
power<00:00:23.640> that's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.840> runners<00:00:25.170> preference<00:00:25.680> we

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
power that's a the runners preference we

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990 
power that's a the runners preference we
can<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.019> runners<00:00:28.380> also<00:00:29.000> directly

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
can see this the runners also directly

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
can see this the runners also directly
shoulders<00:00:30.720> over<00:00:30.990> hands<00:00:31.500> both<00:00:32.340> sides<00:00:32.790> right

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
shoulders over hands both sides right

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
shoulders over hands both sides right
over<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> starting<00:00:33.989> line<00:00:34.200> which<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> good

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
over the starting line which is a good

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580 
over the starting line which is a good
starting<00:00:35.489> position<00:00:35.690> not<00:00:36.690> leaning<00:00:37.050> forward<00:00:37.079> or

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
starting position not leaning forward or

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
starting position not leaning forward or
back<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.840> as<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:41.100> our<00:00:41.250> reaction<00:00:41.489> here

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
back and as we get our reaction here

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
back and as we get our reaction here
driving<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> blocks<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
driving out of the blocks one of the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
driving out of the blocks one of the
first<00:00:44.160> things<00:00:44.370> I'd<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> note<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:46.250> right

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
first things I'd like to note is right

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.170 
first things I'd like to note is right
here<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> little<00:00:49.620> reflex<00:00:50.309> kick<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
here this little reflex kick with the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.389 
here this little reflex kick with the
quick<00:00:51.420> leg<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> he'll<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
quick leg you can see that he'll kind of

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
quick leg you can see that he'll kind of
drops<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:55.070> sometimes<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:57.170> held<00:00:58.170> up

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
drops back sometimes that can be held up

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
drops back sometimes that can be held up
if<00:00:58.590> you're<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.670> block<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.420> too

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
if you're if you're back block is too

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.979 
if you're if you're back block is too
high<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.309> runners<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.180> rear<00:01:03.750> block

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
high so this runners got the rear block

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
high so this runners got the rear block
low<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.860> low<00:01:05.100> enough<00:01:05.369> angle<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
low at low enough angle right here you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.700 
low at low enough angle right here you
can<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.630> he<00:01:10.530> can

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
can see so that he can get that he can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.700 
can see so that he can get that he can
get<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.040> reflex<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.960> all<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.530> get

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
get that reflex in all right as we get

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.570 
get that reflex in all right as we get
started<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.659> driving<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.580> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
started here driving out all the way to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.310 
started here driving out all the way to
a<00:01:17.610> 45<00:01:18.509> degree<00:01:18.750> angle<00:01:19.369> which<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.320> I'll

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a 45 degree angle which you can see I'll

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.469 
a 45 degree angle which you can see I'll
draw<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.590> 45<00:01:23.220> degree<00:01:23.520> angle<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.119> here

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
draw that 45 degree angle up right here

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.910 
draw that 45 degree angle up right here
right<00:01:25.159> there<00:01:26.159> perfect<00:01:27.030> 45<00:01:27.479> degree<00:01:28.049> angle<00:01:28.350> he's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
right there perfect 45 degree angle he's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.929 
right there perfect 45 degree angle he's
driving<00:01:29.430> his<00:01:30.380> quick<00:01:31.380> arm<00:01:31.619> back<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.340> high<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.790> he

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
driving his quick arm back as high as he

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.310 
driving his quick arm back as high as he
can<00:01:33.770> which<00:01:34.770> naturally<00:01:35.400> forces<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> full

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
can which naturally forces a full

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.840 
can which naturally forces a full
extension<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.710> gets<00:01:37.890> him<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.040> full<00:01:38.400> stride

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
extension and gets him to full stride

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.639 
extension and gets him to full stride
length<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.159> he's<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.640> his<00:01:41.880> lead

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
length right there and he's got his lead

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
length right there and he's got his lead
leg<00:01:43.649> driving<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.880> high<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.090> he<00:01:45.390> possibly

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
leg driving out as high as he possibly

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.020 
leg driving out as high as he possibly
can<00:01:46.020> get<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:47.009> right<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> first<00:01:47.790> step

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
can get it all right so the first step

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.060 
can get it all right so the first step
comes<00:01:48.329> down<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.869> driving<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.320> foot<00:01:49.590> straight

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
comes down or driving that foot straight

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.030 
comes down or driving that foot straight
down<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> ground<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.930> we're<00:01:52.770> looking

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
down into the ground and we're looking

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.209 
down into the ground and we're looking
for<00:01:53.220> full<00:01:53.430> extension<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.270> second<00:01:54.780> stride

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
for full extension on the second stride

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
for full extension on the second stride
right<00:01:56.219> there<00:01:56.549> which<00:01:56.820> we're<00:01:57.030> getting<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> nice

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
right there which we're getting a nice

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
right there which we're getting a nice
extension<00:01:58.049> again<00:01:58.530> we're<00:01:58.770> still<00:01:58.979> looking<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
extension again we're still looking at a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.109 
extension again we're still looking at a
45<00:01:59.969> degree<00:02:00.000> angle<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:02.579> runners<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
45 degree angle and the runners going to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.840 
45 degree angle and the runners going to
continue<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.740> gradually<00:02:05.250> works<00:02:05.610> down

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
continue and as he gradually works down

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.050 
continue and as he gradually works down
the<00:02:06.030> track<00:02:06.329> five<00:02:06.840> or<00:02:07.079> six<00:02:07.350> strides<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:08.580> going

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the track five or six strides he's going

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.110 
the track five or six strides he's going
