00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
you're marbling I think that the setup

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.479 
you're marbling I think that the setup
is<00:00:35.540> really<00:00:35.690> important<00:00:36.379> it's<00:00:37.010> good<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.340> have

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
is really important it's good to have

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.780 
is really important it's good to have
lots<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:38.120> paper<00:00:38.390> towels<00:00:39.430> because<00:00:40.430> you're

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
lots of paper towels because you're

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.829 
lots of paper towels because you're
going<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.150> be<00:00:41.330> wiping<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.170> lot<00:00:42.379> of<00:00:42.530> polish<00:00:42.920> off

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
going to be wiping a lot of polish off

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.280 
going to be wiping a lot of polish off
of<00:00:44.839> your<00:00:45.140> orange<00:00:45.470> stick<00:00:45.530> as<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.190> work<00:00:47.290> I'm

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
of your orange stick as you work I'm

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.340 
of your orange stick as you work I'm
using<00:00:48.620> room<00:00:49.040> temperature<00:00:49.580> water<00:00:49.760> here<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.390> I

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
using room temperature water here and I

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.060 
using room temperature water here and I
prefer<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.830> use<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.489> pretty<00:00:53.239> small<00:00:53.659> cup<00:00:54.070> because

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
prefer to use a pretty small cup because

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.759 
prefer to use a pretty small cup because
it<00:00:55.670> keeps<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.540> polish<00:00:56.930> from<00:00:57.199> spreading<00:00:57.650> as

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
it keeps the polish from spreading as

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.160 
it keeps the polish from spreading as
much<00:00:57.979> and<00:00:58.339> kind<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:58.970> keeps<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.390> colors<00:00:59.750> more

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
much and kind of keeps the colors more

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.719 
much and kind of keeps the colors more
vibrant<00:01:00.229> I<00:01:02.229> think<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:03.440> one<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.710> about<00:01:04.309> three

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
vibrant I think this one is about three

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.620 
vibrant I think this one is about three
ounces<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.690> little<00:01:06.080> paper<00:01:06.500> cup<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.630> you

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
ounces it's a little paper cup and you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.020 
ounces it's a little paper cup and you
can<00:01:08.930> drop<00:01:09.890> your<00:01:10.070> polish<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:11.409> as<00:01:12.409> many<00:01:12.770> rings<00:01:13.700> as

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
can drop your polish in as many rings as

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.260 
can drop your polish in as many rings as
you<00:01:14.119> would<00:01:14.479> prefer<00:01:15.969> you<00:01:16.969> know<00:01:17.060> just

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
you would prefer you know just

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.959 
you would prefer you know just
experiment<00:01:17.899> with<00:01:18.020> whatever<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.710> would<00:01:18.829> like

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
experiment with whatever you would like

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.910 
experiment with whatever you would like
different<00:01:19.969> amounts<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:20.960> polish<00:01:21.320> obviously

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
different amounts of polish obviously

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.690 
different amounts of polish obviously
will<00:01:22.070> create<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.399> different<00:01:22.789> look<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:24.700> let's

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
will create a different look so let's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.500 
will create a different look so let's
get<00:01:25.969> one<00:01:26.240> more<00:01:26.450> drop<00:01:26.689> in<00:01:26.899> here

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.390 

and<00:01:29.870> then<00:01:30.260> I'm<00:01:30.560> just<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.040> take<00:01:31.220> my

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
and then I'm just going to take my

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.040 
and then I'm just going to take my
orange<00:01:31.640> stick<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.740> carefully<00:01:34.720> drag<00:01:35.720> through

the Polish and again depending on how
much<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:42.110> dragged<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.570> where<00:01:44.570> exactly<00:01:44.960> you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
much you dragged and where exactly you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.230 
much you dragged and where exactly you
dragged<00:01:45.650> you'll<00:01:46.130> end<00:01:46.370> up<00:01:46.490> with<00:01:46.760> slightly

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
dragged you'll end up with slightly

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.420 
dragged you'll end up with slightly
different<00:01:47.450> patterns<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.440> trial<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.250> error

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
different patterns a trial and error

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.380 
different patterns a trial and error
process<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:52.310> know<00:01:52.430> even<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.000> mess<00:01:53.180> up

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.840 
process and you know even if you mess up
it<00:01:53.540> usually<00:01:53.690> ends<00:01:54.020> up<00:01:54.080> looking<00:01:54.380> pretty<00:01:54.410> good

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
it usually ends up looking pretty good

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.550 
it usually ends up looking pretty good

it stays how well it spreads out you

the water to the bottom and are not
suitable<00:02:59.000> for<00:02:59.180> marbling<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.950> I've<00:03:01.400> found<00:03:01.880> so

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
suitable for marbling but I've found so

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.690 
suitable for marbling but I've found so
far<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:03.110> pretty<00:03:03.500> much<00:03:03.680> all<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.310> colors

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
far that pretty much all of the colors

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.470 
far that pretty much all of the colors
in<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:06.050> OMG<00:03:06.350> collection<00:03:07.100> work<00:03:07.880> really<00:03:08.239> well

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
in the OMG collection work really well

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.270 
in the OMG collection work really well
for<00:03:08.540> marbling<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.680> end<00:03:09.920> up<00:03:10.069> with<00:03:10.250> a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
for marbling and you end up with a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.940 
for marbling and you end up with a
really<00:03:10.580> pretty<00:03:11.650> pattern<00:03:12.650> when<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:13.130> done

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
really pretty pattern when you're done

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.030 
really pretty pattern when you're done
so<00:03:16.870> here<00:03:17.870> we<00:03:17.959> go<00:03:18.140> again<00:03:18.290> with<00:03:18.530> our<00:03:18.709> orange

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
so here we go again with our orange

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.770 
so here we go again with our orange
stick<00:03:19.340> just<00:03:19.970> take<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.630> drag

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.270 

and<00:03:26.300> once<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> design<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:29.010> you're

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
and once you have a design that you're

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:37.460 
and once you have a design that you're
happy<00:03:29.490> with<00:03:31.310> take<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.550> nail<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.729 

don't<00:03:38.160> get<00:03:38.310> in

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.250 

clean<00:03:42.340> up<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.060> extra

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.309 

tap<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.099> water<00:03:49.280> off<00:03:49.489> your<00:03:49.670> nail<00:03:50.049> because<00:03:51.049> if

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
tap the water off your nail because if

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.660 
tap the water off your nail because if
you<00:03:51.500> leave<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.129> on<00:03:52.220> there<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.579> get

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
you leave it on there and you get

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.330 
you leave it on there and you get
bubbles<00:03:53.060> sometimes<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.720> will<00:03:54.129> mess<00:03:55.129> up<00:03:55.159> your

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
bubbles sometimes that will mess up your

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.610 
bubbles sometimes that will mess up your
design<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:57.230> once<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.920> remove<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.730> tape

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
design but once you remove the tape

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.110 
design but once you remove the tape
which<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.650> pretty<00:04:01.010> easy<00:04:01.340> if<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.879> take<00:04:02.060> a

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
which is pretty easy if you just take a

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.600 
which is pretty easy if you just take a
scissors<00:04:02.659> and<00:04:03.049> kind<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.860> cut<00:04:04.040> up<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.310> bottom

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
scissors and kind of cut up the bottom

scissors and kind of cut up the bottom

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
being careful not to get it stuck to my

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.840 
being careful not to get it stuck to my
wet<00:04:20.389> design<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.959> course<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:24.520> there<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.699> can

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
wet design of course and there you can

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.210 
wet design of course and there you can
see<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:26.810> while<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.229> little<00:04:27.650> bit<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.949> cleanup

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
see that while a little bit of cleanup

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.100 
see that while a little bit of cleanup
is<00:04:28.370> required<00:04:28.850> that<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.330> tape<00:04:29.539> does<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.840> pretty

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
is required that the tape does a pretty

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.250 
is required that the tape does a pretty
good<00:04:30.199> job<00:04:30.350> of<00:04:31.180> keeping<00:04:32.180> this<00:04:32.720> from<00:04:32.930> being<00:04:33.110> too

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
good job of keeping this from being too

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.409 
good job of keeping this from being too
