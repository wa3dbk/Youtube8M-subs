00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.809
 panel and here that was here with us 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.809

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 it is a terminal block with emergency gang that's dried necessary 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:36.829

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.829
 Ignition closes the contacts 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:47.760

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.390
 This contact 0 is checking whether it is correct 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.420
