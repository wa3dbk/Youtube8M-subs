00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.960
 between feeling under the star banner 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.580
 Patrick does not do that this time 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.230
 track test unsure but is on the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.880
 looking for an american myth 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.220
 on the way to cable valley california 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:25.910
 on the way to a legendary first 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.550
 racing tracks of the usa laguna seca raceway 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.849
 there is a zod about every racer and ps 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.380
 junkie reason for the 36 kilometers 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.239
 long course is home to one of the 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 most difficult and dangerous turns 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.940
 the world the correction or the pies 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.800
 adorn the legendary race track 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.519
 About two hours by car south of San 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 francisco 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.929
 if you with a mercedes ml 63 amg 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.530
 maybe it's on the way 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:56.359
 only half of the ml 63 amg is yes 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.670
 a very nice car but for the 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:02.199
 Operation corkscrew is needed today 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.199
 in the right corkscrew 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.810
 how about the sl 65 amg black? 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:15.080
 series with 670 hp the strongest series 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.260
 mercedes of all times and 250 kilograms 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 lighter than a normal sl65 of this 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.200
 dare is like a demon on four wheels 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.200
 woe when he lets go 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.229
 the sl made in affalterbach is almost like that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.390
 strong as two 911 porsche 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.340
 accordingly patrick goes in 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 the introductory round first to the 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 Get used to the vehicle and get to the track 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.810
 laguna seca the race track that brings 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 me on the playstation to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.360
 Despair 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.160
 whenever i go through this corpus here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.940
 Will you do that one rally first? 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.410
 drive curve 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.930
 fritz schick we have either i am 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.119
 too fast as slowly restless right 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 and left 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.650
 it is incredible today we are allowed to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.659
 drive laguna seca the name is program 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.549
 the dried up we see the ideal 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.049
 basis for the round course and today 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.950
 must patrick msl on 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.750
 Immediately it comes to the first 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.420
 clash with curves number 8 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.690
 The corkscrew does not know where to go 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.170
 I look sky see the signs that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.170
 110 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.790
 important individual batty 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.700
 patrick the first time you forget 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.700
 never dr come summer please 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.880
 the cabinet-here's something for severely 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.090
 alcoholic there comes up again 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.500
 you drive into the land of fairy tales 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.660
 Nobody's land and on one there comes one 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.950
 number right shafik patrick has in 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.990
 his life already many curves 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.790
 but drive down this 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.380
 it falls to the right and first 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.880
 then turn to the left the chicane has 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.489
 leave a powerful impression 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:18.470
 just as dsl has been known for 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.470
 really right to build your cars 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.550
 everything really all machines already 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.950
 Dangers supergeil is level 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.569
 just the clk gtr a car out 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.489
 Today the sl 65 let's see what's 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.940
 we come to the performance 0 on 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.080
 100 km h 38 seconds 320 km h 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.330
 top speed 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.360
 The torque is electronically 1000 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.470
 otherwise newtonmeter would limit the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.470
 go on driveline 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.370
 h speeding up there but it is right 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.739
 in front of trains 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.080
 also nice made here display 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.640
 tachometer but what so 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.960
 leds 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.960
 the driver in the goal 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.959
 be turned off and then you can 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.400
 different pairs manually 1 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.709
 manually 2 a bit shorter 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.810
 Sharp one during as well 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.940
 the change is made quickly 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.949
 whole to an automatic sorry but me 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.020
 think that is so 10 it here in 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.030
 order 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 the respite is over the time 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.130
 corkscrew right again 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.130
 attack 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.150
 in the early patience has limits 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.480
 Now go to the function 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.480
 but nice 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.670
 properly customer the apparatus 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:02.710
 and if 2 the car can really be 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.420
 super creative woman a bit proud 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.520
 but after 25 reach bit 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.040
 temperature really got clean 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.960
 my left clear when you give to the gas 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.849
 too much power at some point come the 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.199
 Rear 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.599
 but that can be nicely dosed and 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.399
 noticed everything turned off and that must 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.589
 you really clearly say top 

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:22.499
 compliment to affalterbach that one 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:26.389
 Here , too , courage forms as much as 670 ps 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.389
 really to let the kids 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.690
 two reasons why i drove the usa 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.940
 if the one laguna seca I have to 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.040
 clearly say corkscrew is easy 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.040
 a curve breathtaking 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.460
 the second reason sl 65 black series of 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.730
 Amg, too, I have to say very clearly 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.730
 good number 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.029
 the car has with the normal sl65 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:58.159
 nothing at all complete 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.839
 new development huge track broadening 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.879
 and not just the track just wide 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.799
 but kinematics changed that 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.329
 car really absolutely raceways 

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:07.099
 made fit and the work at 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:09.349
 drive the thing did not intervene 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.949
 idea where this car so much grip mr 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.949
 generated 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.240
 if you see him standing there you have to 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.400
 know what it is for one else 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.039
 he can already relatively material I work 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.930
 So the car is relatively flat and 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.030
 insanely wide if you know what 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.080
 behind it is that you 're okay otherwise 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:40.460
 You could almost do it a bit 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:41.780
 say the correction and the sl 65 amg 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.210
 black series 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.430
 the corkscrew is a legend of the sl 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.340
 Could one be the limit 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:54.069
 Quantity of 350 and a price of over 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.069
 300,000 euros make their contribution to this
