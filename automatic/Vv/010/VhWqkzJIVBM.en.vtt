00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 hi today what's in my purchase 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 not a what's in my bike but one 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.120
 what's used in my perth lately 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.690
 namely a somewhat smaller bag 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 why I still really really quiet now 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 my life in the bag I almost go 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.550
 weekend away like pulles sympathize me 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.710
 we look at my last thing in my 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470
 work video to realize that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 But now it's summer being in the peaks 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.680
 nice to have a smaller one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.900
 what smaller bag or are do not know 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.830
 but only the just the much needed 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.870
 occupants just knew to go with that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.940
 banana you know in this case and the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 camel-colored chanel look and this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.539
 does it makes sense on some 40 euros 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 Logical 549 euros will be different below 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.360
 just give a link , by the way , I have to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 not paying for this video it just 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 the plus that I use now 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 and i wanted this how very long i want it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.390
 also like in black but for the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.629
 this summer it is already coming and coming 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.250
 inside of moss with which you put it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.260
 just you can't just hold on like that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.979
 so you also have to shrug it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.390
 shoulder or so and delicious because it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.070
 seems like you just aren't with you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.659
 I no longer have a heavy bag but 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.400
 just embody her hand and it's there 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 a great one 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.530
 he will open with such a kind of one 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.960
 inside is a big of that I think 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 a bit of a disadvantage but I wear 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 surely a wine again than you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.170
 actually and what you can stop 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.310
 that is the most I can do very well 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.189
 did not measure the word yet so it is one 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.549
 big box and I will stop there anyway 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 what comes in it because it's the first one that I 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 shows 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.720
 my wallet I'm just going to ease 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.090
 men's wallet with me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 why do I just find it more pleasant that I have 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.700
 here all my bank cards yes I have one 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.700
 multiple 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.280
 anne warm passes after all receipts and 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.509
 all the passes of stores 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.250
 i like being outside in my 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.930
 driver's license and health insurance card 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.570
 You know this would make them purse of flavor 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.969
 in Amsterdam that I have an article once 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.469
 written about it and I see a beautiful one 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.850
 wallet least add another 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.399
 time it was ready 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.619
 and he really is a lot of work 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.390
 has boxes here and has boxes here 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.250
 and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 you can't do anything in here here 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.970
 here receipts as I really like 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.010
 do as you see I just want 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.430
 like to know me with me and so who 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.959
 is there already the standard link than mine 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 sunglasses I have sunglasses on 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.140
 strength 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.060
 that's what I call because I am without organic 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.590
 blind as your inc 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.480
 so you see me when you see whose and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.580
 then you see me very often 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.530
 changing triple is not even 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.700
 practical but you have to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.950
 because otherwise the crown is not that bad 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.670
 many see it is that not one of the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.440
 nicest 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.030
 mace still new w or so because that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 simply does not go with me and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.540
 must of course be determined 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.340
 So surprise can but I have this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.160
 always just really great fine 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 he is kind of brown and black as 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.120
 lights up and is one that is ethical 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.370
 brown the other moment is black 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.050
 so yeah fine he is big and he 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.580
 just covered here is also shared with me 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:07.250
 sometime headache research man there then 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.100
 my keys and first I had such a bunch 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.680
 I have number seats for several 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.739
 houses and I have all the houses where I 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.180
 not necessarily in urgent need to get into one 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.320
 for example, I just know 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.870
 taken off 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.480
 here are my own house keys 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.190
 I laughed at my parents' job 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.690
 then I can always be there in the corner anyway 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.430
 the need for the man or if there was one 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.310
 problem are that you do have the letters 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.650
 key to kind of things 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.299
 then I have two products that I last 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.980
 I always carry with me that's hens 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.540
 rushing the herb barrel but must 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.220
 no matter what brand it is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.799
 and i fail everything i happen to be about 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.150
 seasoning seasoning put in so 30 spf say 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.560
 the summer it is just handy to be with me 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.360
 I have to note grease was not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 standard in every morning before I receive the 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.250
 go out the door in the summer so me 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.870
 really have a little something unnecessary 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.430
 has recently been perhaps it would 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.720
 well myself i would call that 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.549
 I am not able to pass me tight 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.959
 sit that high and I think so 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.610
 just nice because you just get hit 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.260
 a lot of things outside because 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.320
 I just very dirty wind I am completely 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.579
 not so neurotic find about 20 or film 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.810
 this actually just nice breakfast with that 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.920
 helped with public transportation 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.630
 go beyond me oh ow i do have very much 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.769
 for a long time no students again because I have 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.120
 the u together is half a year 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.410
 I studied 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.610
 done three different courses 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.500
 so yes that he is also completely broken 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.440
 of course I've had it for so long so it 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.750
 is now an ordinary consider then 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.669
 think i always have to always have one 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.020
 bowl with a mirror with me 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.460
 I just have to see if my 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.060
 lipstick is good I need my 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.949
 her can come 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.669
 especially if i go to somewhere 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.260
 appointment I always bring oh always one 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.120
 la bella with me because it gets very bad 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.280
 often dry lips to this is a coincidence of 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.139
 yves rocher 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.910
 and great because I am a woman and just 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.120
 wise 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.370
 you never know thrushes and just 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.350
 a plaster and a blue blue shirt 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.889
 now really feel like a mother with this van 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.660
 thing in my bag 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.180
 but i just get really very fast with 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.229
 blisters of my ballerinas in no you 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.460
 just never know and i got there 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.110
 just don't feel like entering a title 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.760
 and then again a few price is too 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.410
 to buy 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.940
 sportlife from each other could only do more 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.010
 no matter what kind of brand how this just 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.539
 nice and flat 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.100
 It can be handy to have outside for sure 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.690
 if i go to appointment and have when i 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.090
 now is always fresh and how do you develop 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.500
 a long time what the gray have eaten 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.289
 then four that comes nicely 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.060
 not just eating or cutting bushes 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.110
 my mouth but also my skin 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.030
 smell nice 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.180
 this is very coincidentally the dahlia noir of 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.120
 surgery and I always have a tester in it 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.820
 mine in the mail or a smaller 15 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.740
 milliliter of film or perfume 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.560
 sample and there I use my perfume 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.000
 thumbs up for I really have dozens 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.260
 so then they just go on and on 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.970
 I get to know a nice scent and and 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.669
 with coco figure long life comes to I 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.110
 I know about the entire day than or 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.190
 at the end of the day, it should look nice 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.050
 is also a very good way to 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.599
 to test 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.289
 then to perhaps most it 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.849
 most important thing in the world and me 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.840
 show us one of the last things 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.860
 my phone 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.570
 this is an iphone 4 4s 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.220
 not interested so much it's one 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.789
 iphone 4 with maybe an ice cream 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.110
 behind it and this is a casemate one 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.660
 background and I think I have 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.639
 van smartphonehoesjes.nl shares 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.380
 got it I really like it but 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.680
 I really want him with you once 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.490
 but I love it differently 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.550
 phone 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.830
 so with god ball and yes if I have one time 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.630
 I think my provider may follow 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.730
 new phone number from 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.220
 again a new iphone plus but go the 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.750
 do not leave home without a phone even like this 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.640
 that I walk to the letter box below him 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.700
 The building is therefore a makeover 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.510
 very much but it happens then one 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.100
 pen 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.140
 Normally I have a write-down book too 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.850
 at market time it is not in this bag either 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.200
 because I did like this bag to me more 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.520
 want ticket on seems booklet needed 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.170
 do I really want some record 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.780
 the can team phone 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.340
 but we always have a pen for note 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.800
 the case that and that you have a medal anyway 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.600
 not take up much space than if 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.580
 put on the very last lipstick with op 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.500
 hills I think it's so cheerful 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.590
