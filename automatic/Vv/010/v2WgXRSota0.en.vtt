00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.830 

okay<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:02.100> now<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.970> basic<00:00:03.240> overhead

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
okay we're now on to the basic overhead

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.170 
okay we're now on to the basic overhead
cast<00:00:04.140> probably<00:00:05.100> my<00:00:05.250> favorite<00:00:05.609> cast<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:06.029> all

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
cast probably my favorite cast of all

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.450 
cast probably my favorite cast of all
it's<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.990> great<00:00:07.140> cast<00:00:07.529> for<00:00:07.799> creating<00:00:08.189> line

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
it's a great cast for creating line

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.330 
it's a great cast for creating line
speed<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.330> can<00:00:09.510> be<00:00:09.630> very<00:00:09.809> accurate<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.800> with

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
speed you can be very accurate and with

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
speed you can be very accurate and with
practice<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:12.000> course<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.450> can<00:00:12.630> get<00:00:12.780> great

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
practice of course we can get great

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
practice of course we can get great
distance<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:14.940> I'm<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
distance with this one but I'm going to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.019 
distance with this one but I'm going to
look<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.990> its<00:00:16.199> basic<00:00:16.650> form<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.699> today

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
look at it in its basic form here today

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.230 
look at it in its basic form here today
I'm<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.830> through<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> cast<00:00:20.550> stage

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I'm going to go through the cast stage

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.450 
I'm going to go through the cast stage
by<00:00:21.510> stage<00:00:21.539> break<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:22.949> put<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.369> all

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
by stage break it up then put it all

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
by stage break it up then put it all
together<00:00:23.699> again<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> end<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.260> lot

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
together again at the end there's a lot

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.140 
together again at the end there's a lot
of<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.680> key<00:00:25.949> principles<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> those

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of very key principles with this those

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.630 
of very key principles with this those
timing<00:00:27.840> those<00:00:28.260> angles<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> rod<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> when

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
timing those angles of the rod and when

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519 
timing those angles of the rod and when
to<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> power<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.109> we're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> go

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
to put the power in so we're going to go

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.580 
to put the power in so we're going to go
right<00:00:31.740> from<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> very<00:00:32.099> start<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:33.469> like<00:00:34.469> my

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
right from the very start I like my

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
right from the very start I like my
thumb<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.890> top<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> handle<00:00:35.730> very

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
thumb on top of the handle very

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.940 
thumb on top of the handle very
important<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.960> thumb<00:00:37.200> does<00:00:37.380> quite<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> lot<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
important my thumb does quite a lot of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.889 
important my thumb does quite a lot of
work<00:00:38.160> during<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.670> cast<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.480> acts<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
work during the cast it acts like a

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
work during the cast it acts like a
brake<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> back<00:00:40.680> cast<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.489> push

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
brake on the back cast and I push

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
brake on the back cast and I push
through<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.300> thumb<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.110> forward<00:00:43.350> cast<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
through my thumb on the forward cast so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
through my thumb on the forward cast so
I<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.399> thumb<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.910> top<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> start

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
I like my thumb on top just to start

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680 
I like my thumb on top just to start
with<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.950> starting<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> cast<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> very

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
with so starting the cast from the very

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.869 
with so starting the cast from the very
beginning<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.860> important<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.700> rod

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
beginning very important to have the rod

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
beginning very important to have the rod
tip<00:00:51.120> right<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> water<00:00:51.930> surface<00:00:52.260> very

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
tip right on the water surface very

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.369 
tip right on the water surface very
important<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> avoid<00:00:54.930> doing

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
important what you want to avoid doing

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.010 
important what you want to avoid doing
and<00:00:55.530> I've<00:00:55.620> seen<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.039> many<00:00:56.760> times<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and I've seen this many times is if you

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.049 
and I've seen this many times is if you
start<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> cast<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.070> here<00:00:59.309> you've<00:00:59.850> got

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
start to cast from up here you've got

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
start to cast from up here you've got
all<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.420> slack<00:01:00.840> line<00:01:01.230> between<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> rod<00:01:02.039> tip

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
all this slack line between the rod tip

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
all this slack line between the rod tip
and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.579> water<00:01:02.760> surface<00:01:03.300> makes<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> very

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and the water surface makes it very

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
and the water surface makes it very
difficult<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.830> perform<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.430> cast<00:01:05.670> before<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
difficult to perform the cast before I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
difficult to perform the cast before I
can<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> line<00:01:07.260> moving<00:01:07.500> my<00:01:07.860> rods<00:01:08.100> already

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
can get that line moving my rods already

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.760 
can get that line moving my rods already
way<00:01:08.850> up<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> air<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.470> very

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
way up in the air and it's very very

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.679 
way up in the air and it's very very
difficult<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.369> always<00:01:11.549> gives<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.420> low

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
difficult it always gives you a very low

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.230 
difficult it always gives you a very low
inefficient<00:01:13.619> back<00:01:13.830> cast<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.030> very

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
inefficient back cast so it's very

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
inefficient back cast so it's very
important<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.770> rod<00:01:16.920> tip<00:01:17.130> nice

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
important to start with the rod tip nice

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.969 
important to start with the rod tip nice
and<00:01:17.670> low<00:01:17.790> down<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.259> starting<00:01:19.799> low

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and low down like so so starting low

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.630 
and low down like so so starting low
first<00:01:20.640> stage<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.180> simple<00:01:22.340> peel<00:01:23.340> some

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
first stage is very simple peel some

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
first stage is very simple peel some
line<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.479> water<00:01:24.689> before<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.710> accelerate

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
line off the water before we accelerate

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.730 
line off the water before we accelerate
into<00:01:26.640> our<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:26.909> cast<00:01:27.259> now<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
into our back cast now the reason for

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.190 
into our back cast now the reason for
that<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.280> couple<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:30.090> things<00:01:30.270> number<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:31.170> you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that a couple of things number one you

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.870 
that a couple of things number one you
don't<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> spook<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> fish<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.640> sort

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
don't want to spook the fish if I sort

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760 
don't want to spook the fish if I sort
of<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.570> suddenly<00:01:34.200> go<00:01:34.500> right

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
of get in there and suddenly go right

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
of get in there and suddenly go right
I'm<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> whack<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.030> rip<00:01:36.299> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I'm going to whack this and rip that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
I'm going to whack this and rip that
line<00:01:36.689> off<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.079> surface<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.009> can<00:01:38.189> see

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
line off the surface there you can see

we<00:01:48.750> need<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.229> slowly<00:01:49.770> peel<00:01:50.369> our<00:01:50.610> line

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
we need to do is slowly peel our line

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.880 
we need to do is slowly peel our line
off<00:01:51.090> lifting<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> rod<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.049> rind<00:01:52.290> about<00:01:52.619> ten

if we think of this on the clock face

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399 
if we think of this on the clock face
there's<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> vertical<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.409> casting

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
there's the vertical so our casting

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.530 
there's the vertical so our casting

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.479 
our line to go nice and high up behind
us<00:02:18.049> so<00:02:19.049> we<00:02:19.079> need<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.439> stop<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> rod<00:02:20.010> tip<00:02:20.220> nice

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
us so we need to stop the rod tip nice

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.809 
us so we need to stop the rod tip nice
and<00:02:20.760> high<00:02:20.879> if<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.470> low<00:02:22.709> back<00:02:23.040> cast<00:02:23.340> we're

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
and high if we get a low back cast we're

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.580 
and high if we get a low back cast we're
going<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> clip<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.420> water<00:02:24.599> behind<00:02:25.019> or<00:02:25.349> click

going to clip the water behind or click

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920 
going to clip the water behind or click
the<00:02:25.739> vegetation<00:02:26.370> behind<00:02:26.700> possibly<00:02:27.480> lose<00:02:27.720> our

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the vegetation behind possibly lose our

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.830 
the vegetation behind possibly lose our
fly<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.859> we<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.220> away<00:02:29.310> with<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:30.510> tends<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
fly if we get away with it what tends to

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.539 
fly if we get away with it what tends to
happen<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.409> flies<00:02:31.620> shimmy<00:02:32.010> Stein<00:02:32.280> like

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
happen is the flies shimmy Stein like

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.030 
happen is the flies shimmy Stein like
that<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.939> a<00:02:33.000> bit<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.299> heap<00:02:33.480> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that and a bit of a heap and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500 
that and a bit of a heap and
presentation<00:02:35.040> suffrage<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.329> very

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
presentation suffrage so it's very

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.000 
presentation suffrage so it's very
important<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.109> get<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.319> height<00:02:37.530> into<00:02:37.859> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
important to get the height into that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.699 
important to get the height into that
back<00:02:38.220> cast<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.329> we<00:02:39.450> start<00:02:39.720> low<00:02:39.930> peel<00:02:40.319> some<00:02:40.530> line

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
back cast so we start low peel some line

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.339 
back cast so we start low peel some line
off<00:02:40.890> accelerate<00:02:41.549> up<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> stop<00:02:42.329> here's<00:02:43.139> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
off accelerate up and stop here's the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.199 
off accelerate up and stop here's the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
secret thumb on top it's acting like a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.089 
secret thumb on top it's acting like a
brake<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> stopping<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.620> rod<00:02:46.769> quite<00:02:47.069> a

brake and stopping the rod quite a

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.289 
brake and stopping the rod quite a
positive<00:02:47.370> stop<00:02:47.879> there

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
positive stop there

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.539 
positive stop there
very<00:02:48.750> important<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.889> problem<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.519> of

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
very important the problem here of

very important the problem here of
course<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.090> our<00:02:51.389> wrist<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.859> have<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.129> wrist

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
course is our wrist we all have a wrist

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.399 
course is our wrist we all have a wrist
and<00:02:53.730> it's<00:02:54.090> designed<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.079> at<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.379> end

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
and it's designed to do this at the end

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.530 
and it's designed to do this at the end
of<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> arm<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.459> when<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.879> wrist<00:02:57.060> ticks<00:02:57.329> over

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
of the arm but when the wrist ticks over

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.890 
of the arm but when the wrist ticks over
we<00:02:58.470> end<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.889> with<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.970> rod<00:03:00.120> tip<00:03:00.359> coming<00:03:00.599> too

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
we end up with the rod tip coming too

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.740 
we end up with the rod tip coming too
far<00:03:01.139> down<00:03:01.349> behind<00:03:01.769> us<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.599> get

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
far down behind us like so and we get

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.379 
far down behind us like so and we get
that<00:03:06.930> little<00:03:07.349> bat<00:03:07.650> cast<00:03:08.010> very<00:03:08.639> important<00:03:09.269> to

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
that little bat cast very important to

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.319 
that little bat cast very important to
stop<00:03:09.689> up<00:03:09.900> high<00:03:10.159> then<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.310> cast<00:03:11.579> has<00:03:12.000> only<00:03:12.209> got

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
stop up high then the cast has only got

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.270 
stop up high then the cast has only got
to<00:03:12.420> come<00:03:12.569> downhill<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.319> way<00:03:13.409> forward<00:03:13.769> it's

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
to come downhill on the way forward it's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.809 
to come downhill on the way forward it's
much<00:03:14.549> more<00:03:14.819> efficient<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:17.099> heard<00:03:17.310> me<00:03:17.489> say<00:03:17.669> the

stop tap very brief pause if you want to
think<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.260> when<00:03:28.409> you're<00:03:28.530> actually<00:03:28.859> making

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
think of it when you're actually making

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.250 
think of it when you're actually making
a<00:03:29.220> cast<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.790> depends<00:03:30.389> on<00:03:30.449> how<00:03:30.599> fast<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.109> line

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
a cast it depends on how fast the line

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.110 
a cast it depends on how fast the line
is<00:03:31.440> moving<00:03:31.650> how<00:03:31.980> long<00:03:32.159> you<00:03:32.310> pause<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.849> how

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
is moving how long you pause and how

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.240 
is moving how long you pause and how
long<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.419> line<00:03:33.599> you've<00:03:33.780> got<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:34.109> course<00:03:34.139> but<00:03:35.010> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
long the line you've got of course but a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.180 
long the line you've got of course but a
little<00:03:35.819> sort<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.090> tick-tock<00:03:36.690> movement<00:03:37.319> tick

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
little sort of tick-tock movement tick

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.610 
little sort of tick-tock movement tick
and<00:03:38.549> tock<00:03:38.579> is<00:03:39.449> often<00:03:39.930> quite<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.139> good<00:03:40.409> way<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and tock is often quite a good way to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.259 
and tock is often quite a good way to
learn<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.579> pause<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.599> lift<00:03:43.319> slowly<00:03:43.620> up<00:03:44.430> stop

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
learn the pause so lift slowly up stop

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.000 
learn the pause so lift slowly up stop
and<00:03:45.510> then<00:03:45.720> our<00:03:45.840> forward<00:03:46.229> cast<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> nice

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
and then our forward cast is a nice

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.809 
and then our forward cast is a nice
little<00:03:47.370> tap<00:03:47.699> forward<00:03:48.180> like<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.440> up<00:03:49.440> stop<00:03:50.220> push

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
little tap forward like so up stop push

the line comes crashing in we want to

the line comes crashing in we want to
avoid<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.269> this<00:04:09.810> helps<00:04:10.139> create<00:04:10.349> the

avoid that this helps create the

there<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.989> stopping<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.010> rod<00:04:14.159> nice<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.699> high

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
there and stopping the rod nice and high

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.899 
there and stopping the rod nice and high
stop<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.900> rod<00:04:16.049> high<00:04:16.289> and<00:04:16.620> then<00:04:17.280> we<00:04:17.370> just<00:04:17.579> drift

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
stop the rod high and then we just drift

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.780 
stop the rod high and then we just drift
down<00:04:18.150> with<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.419> nice<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.900> slowly<00:04:19.169> like

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
down with it nice and slowly like

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.240 
down with it nice and slowly like
so<00:04:20.540> it's<00:04:20.690> lift<00:04:20.960> slowly<00:04:21.230> up<00:04:22.070> stop<00:04:22.510> tap<00:04:23.510> forward

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
so it's lift slowly up stop tap forward

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.920 
so it's lift slowly up stop tap forward
drift<00:04:25.250> down<00:04:25.490> like<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.620> do<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:27.980> real<00:04:28.190> time

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
looking at this if you're not too keen

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.420 
looking at this if you're not too keen
on<00:04:38.600> maybe<00:04:38.810> memorizing<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.620> clock<00:04:39.860> face<00:04:40.160> and

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
on maybe memorizing the clock face and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.310 
on maybe memorizing the clock face and
thinking<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:40.940> angles<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.600> watch<00:04:42.290> that

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
thinking of the angles is watch that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.040 
thinking of the angles is watch that
line<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.190> air<00:04:43.340> watch<00:04:43.970> how<00:04:44.210> it's<00:04:44.390> moving

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
line in the air watch how it's moving

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.110 
line in the air watch how it's moving
there's<00:04:45.500> our<00:04:45.680> back<00:04:45.920> loop<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.430> there's<00:04:46.940> our

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
there's our back loop and there's our

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.990 
there's our back loop and there's our
forward<00:04:47.600> loop<00:04:47.950> the<00:04:48.950> most<00:04:49.130> efficient<00:04:49.640> casts

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
forward loop the most efficient casts

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.870 
forward loop the most efficient casts
are<00:04:50.090> nice<00:04:50.360> tight<00:04:50.780> loops<00:04:51.080> like<00:04:51.650> so<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.490> energy

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
are nice tight loops like so the energy

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.210 
are nice tight loops like so the energy
is<00:04:53.000> concentrated<00:04:53.320> it's<00:04:54.320> going<00:04:54.680> where<00:04:54.860> we<00:04:55.010> want

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
is concentrated it's going where we want

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.070 
is concentrated it's going where we want
it<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:55.550> go<00:04:55.700> it's<00:04:55.940> more<00:04:56.150> accurate<00:04:56.630> more

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
it to go it's more accurate more
