00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 Hello dear people are back and today 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 we make a really delicious 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 rhubarb ice for more than three years 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.510
 rausgeballert recipes and I would have 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 It's a good thing to conclude 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 nice cover your life with this 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 biggest abba is here next to me 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.369
 It was in the fridge the whole night 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.759
 cooled and that nice and cool now 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.410
 out and that fantastic smell of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
 aroma just great 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.090
 and yes I'm happy here would be nonsense 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.149
 driver best you just stay 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 if he wanted so then it has it here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.590
 once my rhubarb cooled like 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.699
 said and I'll remove that one 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.449
 vanilla pods and the karl amon pieces 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.800
 not to be squeamish now 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 Now here you press everything because 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.520
 if it is not even either syria 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.220
 or stomp or something else because 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:11.340
 the discount should now say small 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.159
 will gc and take me then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.080
 the oranges and express these 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.290
 or maybe you can just do it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.659
 something must mash with a fork 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.570
 Watch it is not so splashing like that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.159
 exactly what I mean but we go 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.390
 Now go 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.530
 next to us but once around the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 Pyrenees still small 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.470
 yes, because I have the youngest fibers 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:44.549
 ultralong in it should be in 1 and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.369
 At least that's not what I want 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.960
 again so far then I give one more 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.610
 Tablespoon brought as soon as the sun where the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.470
 Organic but now pretty strong 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.659
 come through and I do not want it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.119
 completely by saying annoying acid 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.560
 because the ice is nice but we are 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.420
 however, must still be a bit 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.420
 and then mashed as once 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 any names really nice out of it 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.310
 Of course you want to do it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.090
 yoghurt and there I just give 500 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.920
 pure gram 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.640
 next to a mixer 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.480
 something more volatile will give them something 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.569
 Butter milk to 100 grams and the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.110
 would have been underlined once I have two 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.099
 spooning honey done because that's easy 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.940
 is too sour and with natural yogurt now 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:46.110
 We have to look like you 're lucky 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.640
 and I guess that's perfect 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.500
 and then you can either do it in 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.430
 but ice freezing containers make like 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.569
 I make the same 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.700
 there is not much of it either 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.500
 cheaper variant not for the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.959
 Kitchenaid Krups I can then 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.879
 recommend or he makes it easy per 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.400
 Every now and then hear through as well as 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.750
 I always lime that made as a video 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.489
 I also have an infobox for left 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.780
 as well as this much cheaper 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.780
 but just as good an ice machine 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.770
 that's the ice now really nice 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.840
 yummy creamy you can do that right now 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.740
 so eat or your fritz number two 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.330
 hours and then when the food 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.910
 it would be two hours then 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.310
 really nice, so many can shape 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.900
 or if it lasts longer in the refrigerator 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.820
 lars relations freezers let 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.160
 then just a home game before has 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.650
 eat out in the fridge 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.360
 leave and then you can go behind yes too 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.060
 important to curl or belchen hausform 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.420
 yes, and I want to do that now 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:58.320
 normal plastic jar and then vrees like 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:04:00.570
 say again and I tell you mine 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.990
 god that's tasty that when I you 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.640
 after two hours in the freezer there 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.960
 dress up again and then afterwards 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.030
 I will take this with me 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.130
 to my uncle and a verbal afterwards 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.780
 eat first and I'm looking forward to it 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.850
 already have a taste of course and 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.230
 really tasty if you do not 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.390
 ice machine you can now too 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.070
 Manually stirring technology 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.830
 that 's how i have you in for example 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.660
 shown to my mini med new recipe 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.610
 links an infobox age needs 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.410
 not necessarily an otherwise picks one 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.390
 favorable variant as well 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.250
 does the work of the groups 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.960
 machines of machine linked to you 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.050
 also an infobox here and then I am 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.050
 Out
