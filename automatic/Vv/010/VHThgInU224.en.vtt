00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 and the HTC makes can be a 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.710
 open double tap like this so-called 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.330
 motion los works which one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.519
 attitude one can do and which one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.170
 different gestures there are stories to tell 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.170
 I'll give you a quick break 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.720
 before we get the htc motion lounge 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.300
 We must be able to use it at all 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.099
 this first in the settings 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.090
 To turn it on, we just go 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.839
 scroll down to settings 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.150
 display and finger movements and there 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:47.180
 let's go on motion lounge gestures like that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.309
 let's go and get motions gestures 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.589
 We'll see you there and then 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.050
 a little explanation what it all 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.820
 are there with twice had and so on 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.430
 we do not want to anticipate now 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.430
 but that's what I show you now 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.829
 very important is this function 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.410
 also goes into operation and flawless 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.850
 The device must work upright 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.800
 being held 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.509
 I'll show it to you once during this 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.050
 then usually that is not likely 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.160
 So go for example from twice 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.200
 You see, nothing works 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.690
 Now I'm going to pack in the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.520
 smartphone edgewise do now twice 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.650
 have and then I come to the so 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 usual lock screen so it will 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.360
 woken up and I can now so 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.460
 with the help of the function 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.759
 we choose if I think that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.470
 or I like to relax in the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.490
 widgets would go or on the view 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.040
 want to go 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.259
 Well then there are still as I said 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.020
 in turn upright four more 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.299
 They are the ones from right to left 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.310
 written 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.439
 I hope you can see what else 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.270
 not high enough 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.369
 Of course, now unfavorable for the camera 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.560
 because you do not see how it gets 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.020
 but turned on from the right to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.329
 left second goes directly to the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.729
 widgets page so practically euro 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.500
 homescreens where you have your widgets 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.519
 have accordingly and not the view 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 you can see that in the following way 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.579
 you just turn it upside down 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.160
 left to right 2 I do that now 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.510
 again so it works the same 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.609
 from left to right and how does he look 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.709
 So go immediately unlocked and open 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.620
 the link feed then we still have from 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.430
 in turn, from top to bottom 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.150
 going 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 the language choice here you see 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.379
 where I have to say this language choice 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.239
 works so very moderately 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.549
 that is not the normal 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.349
 google language choice but that is the 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:50.060
 internal voice ball from HTC which therefore in 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.430
 You might or might have come across this 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.030
 I can show you that where the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:00.139
 So I only work conditionally show 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.659
 you get the cut there is still in 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:14.959
 Here you see this speech 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:17.239
 function again we give here now 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.680
 the same as the good former holds the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.180
 Employees call that we want 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.799
 Of course not, but you see 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.480
 generally works only very moderately 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.040
 this voice control and this 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.689
 voice control is so here too 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.810
 front option finish so ok and now the 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.489
 last variant would be practically from 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.299
 bottom up 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.129
 so it comes naturally to the oh 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.470
 Of course, this is only upright as well 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.310
 always and there we come 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.139
 according to the last opened 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.579
 So it has been 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.970
 that this was this or that one 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.859
 was 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.829
 depending on whether you have more screen 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.479
 did you go to this appropriate 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:01.220
 shown from bottom to top but also 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:02.359
 only mode format in the last 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.889
 screen you are now watching 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.310
 ask why only in portrait format 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:10.849
 htc wants to prevent that easily 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.040
 the device unexpectedly gets itself 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.650
 just relax from the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.239
 natural gesture out you have that 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.370
 Device in hand, keep it with caution 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 eye contact or whatever and 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.190
 then make the appropriate gestures and 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.289
 to use the smartphone 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.270
 Personally, I think it's a pity 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.520
 because the carrier from South Korea 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.139
 Since then , that's easy 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.000
 only lies and sometimes I find that 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.530
 very handy if I'm easy in the evening 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.659
 just so the smartphone is a desk 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.340
 have to lie and make then twice from 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.020
 just to see what time it is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:45.000
 what weather or something else but 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.650
 yes, the company htc still offers 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.479
 such a flip case but that comes in 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.949
 another tips and tricks videos 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.720
 has no business here 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.220
 Lastly, I want you one more 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.810
 Function show how fast 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.970
 in the camera also comes in the 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.909
 related to the quick gestures easy 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.710
 access from htc works and to that 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.050
 you should not put the smartphone in that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.000
 highland mode but by holding across 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.310
 Mode and there you just need 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.280
 press a volume key and then 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.409
 the camera automatically turns on 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.240
 as you see it here now yes 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.080
 So we have all the gestures through 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.880
 the normal tab gesture from the top to 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.409
 below the bottom to top of the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.379
 right to left and from left to 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.569
 right and the camera button I hope 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.830
 raich liked it if yes thumb 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.469
 up you know 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.830
 and there are a few more 17 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.810
 tracks videos to the htc power looks 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.540
 you of 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.010
 to 16 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.900
 if you liked the video 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.520
 do not forget our kidneys and is 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.710
 maybe about twitter google + and 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.310
 others share that too 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.310
 have women 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.680
 the joints are 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.440
 to the healthy one
