00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.680
This was brought up by the water

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.900
This is remaining of our beautiful beach

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.200
Oh my God, look at that!

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920
Look at all the rubbish all over the place

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.300
The wave comes again, it comes again!

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.220
Look at that!

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.880
The wave comes again, it's a tidal wave!

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.420
Jesus Maria!

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.060
What is going on?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.040
What is happening? Dear God!

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.400
Everything will be destroyed. Never seen something like this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.560
Look at that boy!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.960
People holding on to the poles

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240
Oh my God!

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.020
Look at the car!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.300
Oh virgin Mary

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.680
Look, the cars are floating around

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.100
Several cars are floating and sinking

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.040
oh, look at the cars floating in the lake

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.260
The old man is saving his belongings from devastation. He was in one of the bungalows

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:22.265
No need to comment these images. 
They speak for themselves

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.980
Good God, the cars are still floating around over there

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260
Two cars

00:04:00.015 --> 00:04:02.095
The sea is still furious

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.465
Oh, what will happen now, we have nothing left, nothing.

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.995
Nothing to drink, no food

00:04:17.105 --> 00:04:18.585
Good Lord

00:04:24.335 --> 00:04:26.125
