guessing vegeta as well and this leads

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.780 
guessing vegeta as well and this leads
me<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> believe<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.110> hopefully<00:02:13.830> vegeta<00:02:14.580> will

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
me to believe that hopefully vegeta will

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.860 
me to believe that hopefully vegeta will
have<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.940> very<00:02:15.360> big<00:02:15.599> role<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.989> play<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.200> rez

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
have a very big role to play in rez

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.780 
have a very big role to play in rez
action<00:02:17.049> of<00:02:17.170> F<00:02:17.319> maybe<00:02:17.620> even<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.310> hero<00:02:18.700> of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
action of F maybe even be the hero of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.490 
action of F maybe even be the hero of
the<00:02:19.180> film<00:02:19.360> I<00:02:19.659> think<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.260> would<00:02:20.319> be<00:02:20.379> really

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the film I think that would be really

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.860 
the film I think that would be really
cool<00:02:20.799> although<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> imagine<00:02:21.790> Goku<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.450> probably

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
cool although I imagine Goku is probably

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.630 
cool although I imagine Goku is probably
going<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.110> be<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> one<00:02:23.500> who<00:02:23.950> ends<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.340> saving

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
going to be the one who ends up saving

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.339 
going to be the one who ends up saving
the<00:02:24.909> day<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.390> interesting<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.870> note<00:02:25.959> in

that article you can see a few shots of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.089 
that article you can see a few shots of
this<00:02:28.750> brand<00:02:28.989> new<00:02:29.049> form<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.379> Goku<00:02:29.739> fighting

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
this brand new form of Goku fighting

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.979 
this brand new form of Goku fighting
against<00:02:30.340> Frieza<00:02:30.610> he's<00:02:31.180> already<00:02:31.420> powered<00:02:31.840> up

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
against Frieza he's already powered up

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.809 
against Frieza he's already powered up
and<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.409> seems<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.650> Frieza<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.190> struggling<00:02:33.579> a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
and it seems like Frieza is struggling a

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.180 
and it seems like Frieza is struggling a
little<00:02:34.000> bit<00:02:34.209> more<00:02:34.420> while<00:02:35.049> Goku<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.980> this

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
little bit more while Goku is in this

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.149 
little bit more while Goku is in this
form<00:02:36.579> so<00:02:36.670> apparently<00:02:37.239> blue<00:02:38.019> beats<00:02:38.379> gold<00:02:38.799> in

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
form so apparently blue beats gold in

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.100 
form so apparently blue beats gold in
the<00:02:39.549> dragon<00:02:39.940> ball<00:02:40.120> z<00:02:40.329> universe<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:40.959> we're

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
behind him it's really crazy and it

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.580 
behind him it's really crazy and it
certainly<00:03:15.370> sort<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:15.970> messes<00:03:16.840> with<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> Canon

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.349 
certainly sort of messes with the Canon
a<00:03:17.680> little<00:03:17.920> bit<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.280> know<00:03:18.310> obviously<00:03:18.640> after

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
a little bit you know obviously after

this movie Goku and Vegeta are going to
be<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.859> obnoxiously<00:03:23.859> powerful<00:03:24.549> then<00:03:24.970> it

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
be so obnoxiously powerful then it

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.339 
be so obnoxiously powerful then it
almost<00:03:25.209> seems<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.540> it'd<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.870> practically

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
almost seems like it'd be practically

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.849 
impossible for anyone to actually defeat
them<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.359> it<00:03:28.690> makes<00:03:28.720> me<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.319> back<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859

powerful<00:04:05.049> now<00:04:05.230> I've<00:04:05.620> heard<00:04:05.829> some<00:04:06.040> theories<00:04:06.489> as

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
powerful now I've heard some theories as

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.849 
powerful now I've heard some theories as
to<00:04:06.669> why<00:04:06.940> his<00:04:07.239> hair<00:04:07.449> is<00:04:07.569> blue<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.139> first

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
to why his hair is blue and the first

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.559 
to why his hair is blue and the first
one<00:04:09.040> I'm<00:04:09.250> not<00:04:09.400> quite<00:04:09.730> sure<00:04:09.760> if<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.120> holds<00:04:10.299> much

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
one I'm not quite sure if it holds much

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:11.939 
one I'm not quite sure if it holds much
water<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.989> lot<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.319> it<00:04:11.410> has<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.530> do<00:04:11.769> with<00:04:11.859> the

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
water a lot of it has to do with the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.949 
water a lot of it has to do with the
fact<00:04:12.129> that<00:04:12.370> when<00:04:12.940> Goku<00:04:13.329> was<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> Super<00:04:13.930> Saiyan

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
how it works I'm not entirely sure i'm

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.790 
how it works I'm not entirely sure i'm
not<00:04:37.000> an<00:04:37.150> expert<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.630> this<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.320> i<00:04:38.350> will<00:04:38.530> say<00:04:38.560> is

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
not an expert on this what i will say is

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.310 
not an expert on this what i will say is
I<00:04:39.100> kind<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.550> like<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.910> form<00:04:40.210> i<00:04:40.390> like<00:04:40.600> how<00:04:40.810> the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
I kind of like the form i like how the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.680 
I kind of like the form i like how the
whole<00:04:41.770> blue<00:04:42.040> plays<00:04:42.400> off<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.610> orange<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:43.480> a

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
whole blue plays off the orange it's a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.470 
whole blue plays off the orange it's a
very<00:04:44.020> similar<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:45.030> toriko<00:04:46.030> things<00:04:46.330> have

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
very similar to toriko things have
