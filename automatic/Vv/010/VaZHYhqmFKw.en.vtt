enzymes<00:00:03.959> actually<00:00:04.859> caused<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.940> fat<00:00:06.120> cells<00:00:06.450> to

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
enzymes actually caused the fat cells to

enzymes actually caused the fat cells to
metabolize<00:00:07.770> their<00:00:08.220> fat<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.760> fat<00:00:08.940> cells

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
metabolize their fat that fat cells

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.200 
metabolize their fat that fat cells
shrink<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:10.050> size<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.980> that's<00:00:11.400> why<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.880> believe

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
shrink in size and that's why we believe

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.410 
shrink in size and that's why we believe
that<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> skin<00:00:12.929> shrinks<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:14.009> well<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:15.210> use

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
that the skin shrinks as well we use

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.120 
that the skin shrinks as well we use
cold<00:00:16.230> spray<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> ethyl<00:00:17.730> chloride<00:00:17.930> that

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
cold spray with the ethyl chloride that

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
cold spray with the ethyl chloride that
freezes<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.310> area<00:00:20.760> slightly<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> you

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
freezes the area slightly so that you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.679 
freezes the area slightly so that you
don't<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.160> feel<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> injections<00:00:24.390> to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
don't really feel the injections to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.380 
don't really feel the injections to
speak<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.170> very<00:00:25.980> tiny<00:00:26.369> needles<00:00:26.880> there's

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
speak of very tiny needles there's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.200 
speak of very tiny needles there's
sometimes<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.650> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.310> bruising<00:00:29.730> with

sometimes a little bit of bruising with
the<00:00:30.720> injections<00:00:31.369> weirdly<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> smell<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the injections weirdly you smell like a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630 
the injections weirdly you smell like a
cabbage<00:00:33.570> for<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> day<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.399> about

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
cabbage for about a day but that's about

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
cabbage for about a day but that's about
it<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.090> terms<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> side<00:00:36.840> effects<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> just

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it in terms of the side effects and just

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.130 
it in terms of the side effects and just
melts<00:00:38.160> away<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> fat<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.120> area<00:00:39.840> underneath
