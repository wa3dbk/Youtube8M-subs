00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.919
 air 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.589
 the company reiterates 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.589
 for each club 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 all 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.650
 good 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.850
 I'm going there 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 Earth 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 said 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 clooney 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.530
 should offer nothing 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.159
 who would or would not the guide can be held in the first half of the second 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:36.950
 and the third 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 they made a draw 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.440
 through a lottery 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.620
 there are between the 1st and 2nd bpm approached the ball of the time are the different sexes a 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 train with a team totally different from the other in this country 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.640
 I do not know, I think the ccc quotas that you want to give 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 I was from the first four rounds before the debut in the gaucho is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690
 completely innocent and said that in the first and second 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.960
 as if he were playing the same as a guarantee fund of the first 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.430
 group 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.279
 a second group 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.419
 the numbers 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.179
 councilmen 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:17.569
 I'm bigger than number two in the UN 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.279
 in Ceasa it's difficult 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:22.269
 we did what was expected 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.109
 josé veiga active 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:25.799
 it was fun 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.650
 he was taken in a serious condition 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.739
 appeal against the decision 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 by the status of the elderly 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.650
 in 2006 the difference in the odds of winning if you want to be 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.219
 all revenue 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.489
 Ze Carlos has been expelled. 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.139
 Tania Crime 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.739
 on arrival he saw reborn 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.479
 would give to pass have to say 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.109
 the average brazilian 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.200
 This is not the first time that we find solutions at the 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.069
 I really liked Group 2 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 but second place with one more point 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.029
 I do not know how I'm going to give it all, said the sock. 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.359
 melanie c 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.659
 the group stated 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 what a situation 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 itirapine 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.309
 in practice they 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.029
 it's difficult to create 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.649
 to give away a little taken advantage of unemployed 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.489
 he took the opportunity to say that you can render accounts with 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.639
 the past now already with six points to seven of the chelsea leader and the striker 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.229
 tevez with 122 points in September 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.229
 these environmental health agents 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.139
 the number 2 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.549
 however the two 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.579
 Who knows 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.439
 the worst points and there the car 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.059
 photo after commission 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:03.439
 I sincerely 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.129
 I think working together with group number two is very good while 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.449
 that's the future 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.449
 júlio gomes de almeida 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.009
 my application is difficult because they insist on court 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.840
 Wireless Law Negotiations 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 very good 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 the son of são paulo 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.680
 the unfinished climate 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.930
 it's about these cases
