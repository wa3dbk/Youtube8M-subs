00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.800 
as you remember we planted carrots and
radishes<00:00:02.490> in<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.850> same<00:00:03.030> Road<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.449> year<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
radishes in the same Road this year to

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
radishes in the same Road this year to
help<00:00:03.899> space<00:00:04.259> out<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.620> carrot<00:00:04.950> seedlings<00:00:05.430> well

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
row after determining which is which

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
row after determining which is which

plants holding the soil around its base

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
plants holding the soil around its base
in<00:01:15.390> place<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.470> prevent<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.950> carrot

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
in place this will prevent the carrot

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.480 
in place this will prevent the carrot
roots<00:01:17.549> from<00:01:17.790> being<00:01:18.030> disturbed<00:01:19.070> keep<00:01:20.070> going
