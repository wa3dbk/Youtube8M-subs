00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.509
 gaming laptop on the result but we 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:11.720
 show you where to buy a good 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.830
 Gaming laptops should pay attention 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.930
 we'll be right with the two most important ones 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.570
 components of gaming laptops to 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.770
 processor and the graphics card at both 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.230
 should not save 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.240
 As a rule, fast processor applies 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.840
 powerful graphics card and 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.000
 vice versa 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.100
 otherwise the system itself limits 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.940
 aus save you can save on the 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.910
 random access memory 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.130
 here is minimum four gigabytes eight 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.230
 gigabyte could be it and the 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.910
 performance gain from 8 gigabytes is here 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.040
 not so big the next one 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.470
 component would be the drives here 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.460
 is ideally a combination of a ssd 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.870
 and a hdd what you use that 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.670
 is a question of the purse 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.350
 By the way, that should not be that big 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.280
 you can also on a hybrid plate 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.140
 To fall back on 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.149
 that is, on a hdd with a 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.030
 at least eight gigabytes of large ssd 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.010
 cache another important component 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.640
 Of course, this is the gaming laptop 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.399
 display 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.729
 here should be at least 15 6 inches 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.770
 in full hd resolution that is 1920 x 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.020
 You can decide 1080 pixels 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.990
 between shiny and dull ones 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.719
 displays glossy means you get 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.899
 strong colors good contrasts but must 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.569
 with reflection on your environment 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.119
 The screen is life matte displays 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.859
 besides having just those reflections away 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.619
 but also a contrast ameres and 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.420
 color other picture at the same time is still 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.459
 a component extremely important and that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.499
 The reaction time should be at 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.219
 a minimum of two milliseconds 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.319
 lie 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.849
 another important detail of her 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.649
 Laptops are of course the connections 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.220
 here you should at least four 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.490
 USB ports come for mouse 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.980
 gaming headset keyboard or even a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.050
 gamepad then he should have bluetooth 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.540
 with at least 4.0 standard 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.080
 so that you can also use your tablets or 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.790
 smartphones could pair with the device 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 at the same time he should have a wlan 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.960
 you have it with n standard 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.150
 safe and fast comes into the net and 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.490
 last but not least, at least over 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.840
 a hdmi or over displayports with it 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.450
 you also at the local television 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.070
 can play reasonably another 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.840
 important feature is of course the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.940
 mobility of your gaming laptops 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.920
 here you have to know the bigger that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.500
 gaming notebook gets heavier 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.150
 scratch it for riddle of the 18 inch big 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.160
 because quite happy already at the five kilos 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.750
 and something about it brand you have to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.880
 know if we want to lug around with that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.490
 Of course, this also applies here 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.610
 the more powerful the notebook is ever 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.350
 bigger the notebook is the more intense 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.630
 the games will play here 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.540
 the shorter the battery life 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.860
 So always have a power supply then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.500
 nothing can happen to you 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.900
 and for 90 minutes of fun in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.010
 every case should be for the train journey 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.750
 that will not be a problem 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.910
 Finally, of course, still the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.230
 exciting question to clarify how expensive is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.360
 because such a gaming notebook 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 Here I can only say everything can 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.630
 nothing has to be 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.910
 basically applies to devices of the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.910
 rod are the costs at about 800 euro 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.950
 and start there for devices that just 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.930
 from individual smaller manufacturers or 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.460
 so-called gaming manufactories come 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.910
 as 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.420
 high tech game machine smith or too 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.370
 xmg the devices start at around 850 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.390
 euro and have up really 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.850
 no border even more videos you will find
