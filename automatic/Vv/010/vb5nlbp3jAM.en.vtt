00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.480
 back at he leaves 2013 with the mother 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.010
 is yes we are testing these beautiful 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 claas lexion 580 that a little 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 notebook then bake it once 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 you get three parties in it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.289
 included is the glass door with 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 chain drive then the tailor and that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.449
 associated cutting work from the outside 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.910
 of course looks good to take 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 yes standard stop and we drive 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.210
 with all the spun black to and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 which I like very much you see 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.530
 smoke stays here and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 then slowly it disappears 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.000
 a bit much smoke for him 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 wegfährt but I think really we have 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.960
 the remains of the predator and never more gas 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 is the more pity that is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 we still full throttle that he no one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 then, of course, the real one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 neither does it always come back up 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.480
 still out when driving away did not like that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.519
 lots of black smoke but we say that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.150
 comes closer to the real for us than we mass 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.130
 the standard vehicles looks at the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 Driving this way is a lot 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 smoke and then it will be less so the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.330
 Driving behavior fits so far 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.580
 that works too, he 'll be fine too 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:33.900
 that works fine finally there 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:42.290
 also blinker works 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:44.579
 also not turn off the fastest 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.720
 well I know I sell 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 but I do not want to have them 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.689
 do not sell anything which of course stupid 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.250
 you see it somehow right below 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.869
 with the players that one sees which 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.659
 attached device is the overlap 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:04.020
 of course not so bad now 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:07.890
 but yes could be better so now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 we need something we now 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.349
 Selected as the tailor okay 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.060
 now works that way exactly 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.830
 perfect 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.680
 then you can hang on it say we 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.209
 that was me at the tailoring 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.010
 now how beautiful that 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.680
 draws and then there is only after 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.650
 In a while this disappears 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.090
 Could each of me as each tug each 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.010
 of course all have eraser 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.849
 was perhaps not as extreme black 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 that's already over 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.900
 world improvement but the way 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.900
 I like it 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:52.230
 So I'm just wrong with you 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.430
 his view is considered the best 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.720
 there you see where my worth yes I will 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:05.280
 the combine real life i know that 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.760
 where to watch out there must be one more 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.050
 understand mädel apply so as to catch 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 Let's have a look at it 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.810
 so that you are interested then we have 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.360
 for working mode change nothing right here 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.400
 rear split opened up here the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.940
 quad the grain store drechsler 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.750
 selected that you have work light 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:41.010
 welver earth works in the front back 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:46.200
 turn on and that's standard from the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.500
 planner stoke smoke arises that fits 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.500
 everything 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.740
 and now you have to do something here 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.740
 come out or not 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:05.680
 Winterkorn really thanks me again 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:11.370
 here everyone comes here comes nothing 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.370
 there was nothing I had once helper one 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.010
 but now he listens to the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:23.280
 nothing comes out okay or has to 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.290
 to turn on the separate work light 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.790
 shut down the driver namely the 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.790
 will have to turn it on separately 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.320
 works is pretty loud or 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.390
 stay with me so no idea as he 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.350
 sows functions befied shop.de 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:48.340
 saada class with quartz 1000 yes 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.810
 Cutting work suitable maintenance costs 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.420
 all stated that new car 25 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.060
 under it was a bit fierce though 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.530
 year 2006 as well, we look again 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:05.320
 lures here you can also see beautiful again 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:09.040
 changes after the lok says nothing 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.800
 but she says it has lots of errors 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.470
 to make tip without mistakes or that 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.430
 bag to be exact yes continue murder 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.630
 you can imagine you can 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.670
 Just stop by 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.580
 as I said that with the smoke genuine 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.870
 Hammer, after that does not know that better 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.570
 as I said maybe not so 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.830
 black 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.290
 then just brighter but should be real 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.190
 the idea alone works that way and so on 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.300
 I thought I like something like that 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.920
 Maybe take on names 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.930
 a little more, they are watching 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.550
 little bit off then good until the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.720
 So we'll see each other next time 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.720
 people until then
