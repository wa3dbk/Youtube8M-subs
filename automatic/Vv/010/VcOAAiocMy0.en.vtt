looks<00:05:12.480> pretty<00:05:12.690> sturdy<00:05:13.010> but<00:05:14.010> again<00:05:14.690> you<00:05:15.690> see

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
looks pretty sturdy but again you see

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.470 
looks pretty sturdy but again you see
the<00:05:17.250> name<00:05:17.520> on<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.820> back<00:05:18.030> I<00:05:18.060> know<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.420> a

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
the name on the back I know it's a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.470 
the name on the back I know it's a
different<00:05:18.870> meaning<00:05:19.050> but<00:05:19.350> looks<00:05:20.310> like

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
different meaning but looks like

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480 
different meaning but looks like
Fletcher<00:05:21.480> might<00:05:21.870> be<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.080> little<00:05:22.860> bigger<00:05:23.160> the

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
Fletcher might be a little bigger the

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.710 
Fletcher might be a little bigger the
letter<00:05:23.700> is<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:23.940> little<00:05:24.270> bigger<00:05:24.480> than<00:05:24.570> the

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
letter is a little bigger than the

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.320 
letter is a little bigger than the
griffin<00:05:25.490> so<00:05:26.490> that's<00:05:26.850> another<00:05:29.330> difference

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
griffin so that's another difference

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.630 
griffin so that's another difference
right<00:05:30.480> there's<00:05:31.230> just<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.710> bigger<00:05:31.950> font<00:05:34.640> the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
right there's just a bigger font the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.110 
right there's just a bigger font the
mesh<00:05:36.120> is<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.540> right<00:05:36.690> places<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:38.120> regular

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
mesh is in the right places and regular

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.670 
mesh is in the right places and regular
fabric<00:05:39.540> is<00:05:39.660> in<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.870> right<00:05:39.990> places<00:05:40.230> but<00:05:40.440> of

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
fabric is in the right places but of

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.600 
fabric is in the right places but of
course<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:41.010> I<00:05:41.070> said<00:05:41.250> it's<00:05:41.370> a<00:05:41.430> different

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
course like I said it's a different

course like I said it's a different
fabric<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.810> can<00:05:42.960> really<00:05:43.140> see<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.380> on<00:05:43.440> camera

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
fabric you can really see it on camera

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.110 
fabric you can really see it on camera
but<00:05:43.950> if<00:05:44.070> you<00:05:44.190> could<00:05:44.310> prepare<00:05:44.640> you<00:05:44.760> can<00:05:44.910> feel

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
but if you could prepare you can feel

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.450 
but if you could prepare you can feel
that<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:46.050> is<00:05:46.230> definitely<00:05:46.590> not<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.920> Nike

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460
