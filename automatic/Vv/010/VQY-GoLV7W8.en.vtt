00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
just fussing not too much you don't want

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.259 
just fussing not too much you don't want
to<00:03:30.350> overthink<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.190> it's<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.400> very<00:03:31.609> casual

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
to overthink it it's a very casual

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.640 
to overthink it it's a very casual
approach<00:03:33.130> then<00:03:34.130> last<00:03:34.780> taking<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:35.989> a<00:03:36.109> little

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
approach then last taking just a little

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.640 
approach then last taking just a little
bit<00:03:36.829> of<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.100> pussy-willow<00:03:38.170> giving<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.350> cut

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
bit of the pussy-willow giving it a cut

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.479 
bit of the pussy-willow giving it a cut
and<00:03:40.329> adding<00:03:41.329> value<00:03:41.630> by<00:03:42.500> adding<00:03:42.859> height<00:03:43.130> and

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
and adding value by adding height and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.699 
and adding value by adding height and
size<00:03:43.729> right<00:03:44.180> down<00:03:44.389> through<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.690> center<00:03:44.720> makes

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
size right down through the center makes

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.070 
size right down through the center makes
the<00:03:45.919> bigger<00:03:46.359> showier

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
the bigger showier

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.770 
the bigger showier
Buller<00:03:49.660> with<00:03:50.660> very<00:03:51.080> little<00:03:51.350> effort<00:03:51.710> and<00:03:52.780> the

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
Buller with very little effort and the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.800 
Buller with very little effort and the
added<00:03:54.350> bonus<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:54.860> this<00:03:55.340> technique<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.690> that

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
added bonus to this technique is that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.090 
added bonus to this technique is that
it's<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.110> look<00:03:57.320> good<00:03:57.530> all<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:58.070> way

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
it's going to look good all the way

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.830 
it's going to look good all the way
around<00:03:58.580> when<00:03:58.820> you're<00:03:58.970> done<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.480> doesn't<00:03:59.720> have

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
a front or a back and it doesn't need a

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:12.640 
a front or a back and it doesn't need a
bow<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:03.080> love<00:04:03.800> that

your foliage don't put your stuff down
in<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> water<00:04:36.770> curly<00:04:37.699> willow<00:04:37.849> perfectly<00:04:38.780> fine

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
in the water curly willow perfectly fine

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.510 
in the water curly willow perfectly fine
it<00:04:39.199> will<00:04:39.319> not<00:04:39.590> shorten<00:04:40.039> the<00:04:40.129> life<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
it will not shorten the life of the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.700 
it will not shorten the life of the
flowers<00:04:40.849> at<00:04:41.000> all<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.539> it<00:04:41.720> doesn't<00:04:42.110> take<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
flowers at all and it doesn't take the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.559 
flowers at all and it doesn't take the
water<00:04:42.949> so<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.460> can<00:04:43.610> go<00:04:43.729> ahead<00:04:43.849> and<00:04:44.150> do<00:04:44.300> that

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
water so you can go ahead and do that

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.800 
water so you can go ahead and do that
then<00:04:45.289> for<00:04:45.319> the<00:04:45.650> roses<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.970> actually<00:04:47.449> have<00:04:47.629> to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
then for the roses you actually have to

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.990 
then for the roses you actually have to
remove<00:04:48.199> all<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.560> foliage<00:04:49.009> this<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.759> hard

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
remove all the foliage this is the hard

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.700 
remove all the foliage this is the hard
part<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.509> will<00:04:50.599> hurt<00:04:50.810> your<00:04:50.960> feelings<00:04:51.500> you're

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
part it will hurt your feelings you're

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.180 
part it will hurt your feelings you're
thinking<00:04:52.009> oh<00:04:52.310> no<00:04:52.340> those<00:04:53.120> poor<00:04:53.389> roses<00:04:54.139> but<00:04:55.099> you

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
thinking oh no those poor roses but you

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.209 
thinking oh no those poor roses but you
need<00:04:55.400> a<00:04:55.430> very<00:04:55.520> crisp<00:04:56.270> clean<00:04:56.960> look<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.889> can't

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
need a very crisp clean look you can't

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.939 
need a very crisp clean look you can't
have<00:04:58.580> it<00:04:58.849> be<00:04:59.090> messy<00:04:59.810> this<00:05:00.500> is<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.710> very

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
have it be messy this is a very

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.550 
have it be messy this is a very
contemporary<00:05:01.490> approach<00:05:02.270> then<00:05:03.050> cutting<00:05:03.409> them

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
contemporary approach then cutting them

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.920 
contemporary approach then cutting them
short<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.759> yes<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.270> where<00:05:05.509> you<00:05:05.599> can<00:05:05.780> buy

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
short so yes this is where you can buy

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.140 
short so yes this is where you can buy
your<00:05:06.199> shorter<00:05:06.560> roses<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.099> 40<00:05:07.430> centimeter<00:05:07.909> or

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
your shorter roses the 40 centimeter or

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.749 
your shorter roses the 40 centimeter or
less<00:05:08.509> to<00:05:09.110> cut<00:05:09.319> them<00:05:09.440> short<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:09.949> then<00:05:10.580> just

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
less to cut them short and then just

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:16.899 
less to cut them short and then just
drop<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.240> straight<00:05:11.419> down<00:05:11.810> in<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:15.190> work<00:05:16.190> 12<00:05:16.669> of

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
drop it straight down in and work 12 of

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.890 
drop it straight down in and work 12 of
them<00:05:17.090> across<00:05:17.659> the<00:05:18.259> neck<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.800> vase<00:05:19.900> and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
them across the neck of the vase and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.749 
them across the neck of the vase and
they<00:05:21.020> can<00:05:21.229> vary<00:05:21.620> a<00:05:21.740> little<00:05:21.919> bit<00:05:22.159> up<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.580> down

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
they can vary a little bit up and down

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.330 
they can vary a little bit up and down
or<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.599> can<00:05:23.750> get<00:05:23.870> them<00:05:24.020> exactly<00:05:24.440> perfect<00:05:25.190> and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
or you can get them exactly perfect and

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.420 
or you can get them exactly perfect and
have<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.639> be<00:05:25.819> a<00:05:25.849> flat<00:05:26.419> pave<00:05:26.990> I<00:05:27.259> actually<00:05:27.770> like<00:05:28.159> a

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
have it be a flat pave I actually like a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.749 
have it be a flat pave I actually like a
little<00:05:28.880> more<00:05:29.090> character<00:05:29.840> some<00:05:30.469> up<00:05:30.710> some<00:05:31.460> down

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 
little more character some up some down

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.839 
little more character some up some down
I<00:05:32.120> think<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.449> adds<00:05:32.690> dimension<00:05:33.400> but<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.550> really

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
I think it adds dimension but you really

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.860 
I think it adds dimension but you really
enjoy<00:05:35.090> looking<00:05:35.389> at<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.840> roses<00:05:37.539> even<00:05:38.539> let<00:05:38.690> the

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
enjoy looking at the roses even let the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.570 
enjoy looking at the roses even let the
willow<00:05:39.110> go<00:05:39.380> over<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.800> top<00:05:40.069> a<00:05:40.099> little<00:05:40.310> bit

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
willow go over the top a little bit

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:58.840 
willow go over the top a little bit
that's<00:05:41.090> fun<00:05:41.449> adding<00:05:41.810> some<00:05:42.289> depth

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.060 

coming<00:05:59.850> up<00:05:59.940> over<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.480> top<00:06:00.810> here<00:06:03.860> one<00:06:04.860> two

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
coming up over the top here one two

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:13.210 
coming up over the top here one two
three<00:06:05.370> four<00:06:05.639> five<00:06:05.850> six<00:06:06.120> seven<00:06:06.720> eight<00:06:06.810> nine<00:06:07.250> ten

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.750 

eleven<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:15.150> one<00:06:15.690> more<00:06:16.190> thinking<00:06:17.190> about<00:06:17.280> where

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
eleven and one more thinking about where

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.550 
eleven and one more thinking about where
it<00:06:17.940> will<00:06:18.090> fill<00:06:18.419> in<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.810> bastion<00:06:19.260> I<00:06:19.320> think

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
it will fill in the bastion I think

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.409 
it will fill in the bastion I think
right<00:06:19.860> here<00:06:19.970> adding<00:06:20.970> a<00:06:21.030> little<00:06:21.210> more

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
right here adding a little more

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.230 
right here adding a little more
dimension<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.290> side<00:06:22.910> then<00:06:23.910> it<00:06:24.060> looks

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
dimension to this side then it looks

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:34.190 
dimension to this side then it looks
beautiful<00:06:24.510> both<00:06:25.470> sides
