installation<00:02:49.100> say<00:02:50.100> ok<00:02:51.170> installing

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.039 

take<00:02:59.290> a<00:03:00.120> might<00:03:01.120> take<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> little<00:03:01.540> bit<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.780> time<00:03:01.989> I

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
take a might take a little bit of time I

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.869

think<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.500> app<00:03:03.129> is<00:03:03.519> about<00:03:03.989> three<00:03:04.989> megabytes

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
think the app is about three megabytes

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.170 
think the app is about three megabytes
so<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:08.019> know<00:03:08.140> about<00:03:08.409> medium<00:03:08.769> sized<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.519> far<00:03:10.000> as

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
so you know about medium sized as far as

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.789 
so you know about medium sized as far as
applications<00:03:10.989> go<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.170> is<00:03:14.260> all<00:03:14.590> right

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799
