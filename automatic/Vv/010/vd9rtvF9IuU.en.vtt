00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
lubricated that way you're not gonna get

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
lubricated that way you're not gonna get
any<00:01:14.040> fingerprints<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.540> slide

temperature<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.840> it'll<00:01:22.380> seal

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
temperature so this way it'll seal

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
temperature so this way it'll seal
properly<00:01:23.180> now<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.450> ought<00:01:24.570> nice<00:01:24.750> and

than you take a look at this now when we
slide<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.200> takes<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
slide this in which takes all of a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.200 
slide this in which takes all of a
couple<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.100> seconds<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> notice<00:01:59.790> I've<00:02:00.060> got<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
couple of seconds you notice I've got a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.550 
couple of seconds you notice I've got a
lot<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> nibs<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.079> bottom<00:02:01.409> right

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
lot of the nibs on the bottom right

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.780 
lot of the nibs on the bottom right
there<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> keep<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> from

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
there that's going to keep it from

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
there that's going to keep it from
floating<00:02:03.119> around<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:04.170> will<00:02:04.320> slide<00:02:04.680> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
floating around and we will slide this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
floating around and we will slide this
in<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:06.500> boom<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.129> nice<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.759> place

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
in and boom all right nice and in place

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
in and boom all right nice and in place
now<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> took<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> stock<00:02:09.869> clip<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> they

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
now I took that stock clip out and they

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
now I took that stock clip out and they
send<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> replacements<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.450> this

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
send the replacements right here so this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.940 
send the replacements right here so this
right<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.410> place

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
right into place

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.950 
right into place
and<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.610> simply<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.270> Center<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.600> right<00:02:15.780> over

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and it's simply you Center it right over

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.690 
and it's simply you Center it right over
that<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.260> screw<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.070> top<00:02:17.250> piece<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.490> that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that and screw on the top piece and that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.610 
that and screw on the top piece and that
holds<00:02:17.970> everything<00:02:18.180> into<00:02:18.450> place<00:02:18.570> now<00:02:19.350> that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
holds everything into place now that

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.960 
holds everything into place now that
it's<00:02:19.770> there<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
it's there you can really see the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550 
it's there you can really see the
difference<00:02:21.330> because<00:02:21.510> look<00:02:21.870> it's<00:02:22.230> got<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
difference because look it's got the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.930 
difference because look it's got the
ridge<00:02:22.770> going<00:02:23.160> all<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> way<00:02:23.460> around<00:02:23.820> that's

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
ridge going all the way around that's

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.280 
ridge going all the way around that's
going<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.240> contain<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.840> mess

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
going to contain the mess

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.680 
going to contain the mess
whether<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.920> mud<00:02:26.190> or<00:02:26.580> dirt<00:02:26.640> or<00:02:27.210> water<00:02:27.510> or

whether it's mud or dirt or water or

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.690 
whether it's mud or dirt or water or
snow<00:02:28.110> whatever<00:02:28.440> he<00:02:28.710> brings<00:02:29.010> into<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.430> truck

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
snow whatever he brings into this truck

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.310 
snow whatever he brings into this truck
it's<00:02:30.090> staying<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.660> there<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> it's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it's staying right there and it's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.350 
it's staying right there and it's
protecting<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.070> rest<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.580> floor<00:02:32.850> it<00:02:33.300> goes

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
protecting the rest of the floor it goes

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.090 
protecting the rest of the floor it goes
up<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.960> backside<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.560> pedals<00:02:34.890> back

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
up on the backside of the pedals back

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.470 
up on the backside of the pedals back
there<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.430> comes<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.970> way<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
there and comes all the way out to the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.150 
there and comes all the way out to the
threshold<00:02:36.780> another<00:02:37.410> cool<00:02:37.620> thing<00:02:37.680> about<00:02:37.860> these

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
threshold another cool thing about these
