00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 from oliver samsung and I always stand 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.130
 again in the samsung book by the cs 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.180
 2015 and it has now made the day one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.310
 new os for the nine so for the tv line 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.859
 presented by 2015 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.880
 the operationally quite as new called 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.410
 could already die 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 is already in the development for 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.789
 mobile phones more or less already 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.990
 officially but in germany 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.380
 at least not in any device represented 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.180
 what the break I thought I may unfortunately 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.010
 not the hand I take rent 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 I do not think so 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.870
 the bugs and the mistakes are there 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.250
 stuck in the provident product still 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.510
 but I have been a little 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.640
 get guidance 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.829
 you have installed that was the day 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.449
 as well as art is a new theme that 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.250
 means one does not have a complete window 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.780
 More of what is open but only 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.129
 take a little bar 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.229
 where to put the new remote control 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.089
 also by splitting can there you have then 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.559
 just opened the first app and in the 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.479
 app you can order this again 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.890
 open and see how fast you get there 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.350
 from excel can 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.869
 how does that easily the new ones 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.560
 TV that is through the 8000 9000 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.149
 the series now here 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.819
 They come with an eight - core processor 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.590
 what exactly that can or from who is 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.200
 do not is probably a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.399
 Samsung processor the heels are already 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.979
 very particular and that is the way it is 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.479
 fast function you need to 1 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.149
 the processor and the other needs 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.060
 one also specifications as I said 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.300
 pre-serial device one tells us nothing and it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.740
 is not final anyway 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.380
 You can see you can also quite normal 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 blow 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.130
 understatement 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.390
 I can not do as much to you 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.659
 if you can not tell it yourself in the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 can take hand 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.380
 We are already now a spielchen 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.890
 that is not quite so 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 Interesting 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.030
 you have playstation with it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.620
 watery eyes wander with the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.440
 corresponding together 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.630
 quite simply player stream 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.890
 of course, currently 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.710
 That is currently still the devices 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.720
 not available 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.400
 once the device comes sony games 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.290
 mainly for the playstation 3 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.220
 I believe 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.710
 but not to play 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.480
 you also need again a controller 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.380
 a determined so a playstation 4 see 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.480
 I'm here right now 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.680
 I mean that should be in itself 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.780
 with a playstation 3 controller 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.040
 function 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.470
 Of course there will be a decent one 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.470
 internet line i was coming to it 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.530
 but the advantage is that you look 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.319
 thereby the fans 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 can save and only in an abo and in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.740
 one or two controllers depending on 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.240
 invest yes as I said there are 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.790
 quite a few innovations with the partly 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.760
 in tv there will even be one 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.849
 an evolution fit for the 2013 and 2014 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.680
 give models then is not clear though 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.359
 it will probably be available 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.600
 as soon as these televisions hit the market 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.590
 it's time to get there 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.230
 march april 2015 already 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.030
 and yes, then evolution should be 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.330
 kit be available the price is that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.460
 I also do not know great 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.800
 but as soon as there are new information 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.840
 Of course, we'll tell you about it on the 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.390
 keep running and that 's it 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.770
 first with dsds or with the partly in 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.030
 tv 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.350
 I still have a little something in the blog 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 written is the top
