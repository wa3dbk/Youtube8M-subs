you're going to get folders like this

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.170

they're<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.459> look<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.580> this<00:03:13.790> and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
they're going to look like this and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.810 
they're going to look like this and
stuff<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.739> if<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.370> haven't<00:03:16.519> done<00:03:16.760> this

stuff so if you haven't done this
already<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.360> think<00:03:17.660> what<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.870> should<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.050> this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
already I think what you should do this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.940 
already I think what you should do this
you<00:03:18.470> should<00:03:18.850> hide<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.470> stuff<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:21.709> your

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
you should hide the stuff on your

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.810 
you should hide the stuff on your
desktop<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:24.019> it<00:03:24.380> looks<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.830> mac<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:28.670> now
