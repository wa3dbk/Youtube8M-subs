home<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:06.990> draw<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.610> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
home that I can actually draw on so I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.359 
home that I can actually draw on so I
did<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:08.909> sketch<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
did a little sketch and just kind of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.410 
did a little sketch and just kind of
figure<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> colors<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> stuff<00:01:12.270> it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
figure out the colors and stuff it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
figure out the colors and stuff it's
actually<00:01:12.630> changed<00:01:12.900> quite<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.200> since<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
actually changed quite a bit since the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.580 
actually changed quite a bit since the
sketch<00:01:14.100> too<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> started<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
sketch too but I started with that so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
sketch too but I started with that so
then<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.830> could<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.040> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> dive<00:01:17.880> right

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
then I could just kind of dive right

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.499 
then I could just kind of dive right
into<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.080> did<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> sky<00:01:20.640> first<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.390> know

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
into it and I did the sky first you know

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.830 
into it and I did the sky first you know
it<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> backdrop<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> clouds<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it was a backdrop and the clouds and you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.210 
it was a backdrop and the clouds and you
know<00:01:24.960> our<00:01:25.110> foreground<00:01:25.409> here<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
know our foreground here and then I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.590 
know our foreground here and then I
wanted<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> render<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> mountains

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
wanted to render it out the mountains

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
wanted to render it out the mountains
that<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.590> nice<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> could

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that was really nice because I could

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
that was really nice because I could
paint<00:01:29.310> her<00:01:29.400> right<00:01:29.790> over<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
and being in this kind of fanciful

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.289 
and being in this kind of fanciful
landscape<00:01:50.250> could<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.450> alien<00:01:51.960> planet<00:01:52.290> maybe

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
landscape could be an alien planet maybe

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
landscape could be an alien planet maybe
another<00:01:54.299> dimension<00:01:55.110> or<00:01:55.439> something<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:56.100> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you know so maybe it could be the world

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.119 
you know so maybe it could be the world
between<00:02:05.009> worlds<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.570> cool<00:02:06.950> she's<00:02:07.950> got

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
once which you know I guess that could

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.570 
once which you know I guess that could
be<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:35.060> thing<00:02:35.510> she's<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> human<00:02:36.799> character

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
be a thing she's like a human character

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.970 
be a thing she's like a human character
but<00:02:38.060> maybe<00:02:38.750> there's<00:02:39.019> some<00:02:39.230> some<00:02:39.620> animal

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
but maybe there's some some animal

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.940 
but maybe there's some some animal
emminster<00:02:40.519> like<00:02:41.180> her<00:02:41.360> nose<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.959> not<00:02:42.140> entirely

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
emminster like her nose is not entirely

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.000 
emminster like her nose is not entirely
human<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.090> her<00:02:44.360> she's<00:02:44.720> got<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.900> antlers<00:02:45.470> I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
human and her she's got the antlers I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.640 
human and her she's got the antlers I
don't<00:02:46.790> think<00:02:46.940> she<00:02:47.120> has<00:02:47.299> a<00:02:47.330> name<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:48.079> don't<00:02:48.470> know

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
don't think she has a name I don't know

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.710 
don't think she has a name I don't know
I<00:02:48.709> don't<00:02:49.099> know<00:02:49.160> why<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.579> we<00:02:49.760> see<00:02:50.000> Poppins<00:02:50.480> and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
I don't know why but we see Poppins and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.140 
I don't know why but we see Poppins and
for<00:02:51.019> some<00:02:51.230> reason

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.860 

so<00:02:56.150> then<00:02:56.480> cake<00:02:56.860> subside
