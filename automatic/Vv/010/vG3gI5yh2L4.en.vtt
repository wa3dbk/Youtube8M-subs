00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi to all the guys i'm always 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 it was in place and this welcomes you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:13.620
 new snapshot video 13 v 49 a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 snap shot that I hate will affect the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.760
 version 1.7 point 3 so I remind you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.359
 that we still don't talk about version 1.8 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.490
 but there is talk of a new version 1.7 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.949
 that is , note 3 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.019
 so why is i making this video 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 because I didn't do it with only 48 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.829
 because the snap shot 13 v 48 a was 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.200
 only bugfixes so it wasn't there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 absolutely nothing to say nor da 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.450
 show this snapshot instead of axes 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.399
 so many bug fixes concerning it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.969
 twitch the game or bugs from 1.7.2 but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.120
 also a gem a small novelty that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.070
 I'm going to show you right away 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 look here what is lively 1 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.400
 here's what i'm doing is a new one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 variant of mob ie the chicken 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 jockey then you know that there is the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.000
 the spider jockey that would be one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.030
 skeleton riding a spider and pull out 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.920
 dangerous because they attack you together 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.750
 well from this moment there will also be the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.970
 chicken jockey as you see is a zombie 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 small a baby zombie riding one 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.820
 hen and then we'll also see 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.130
 how it attacks us then how it behaves 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.759
 so this is inserted into the game 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 mob 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.520
 I'm not the one to make things easier 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.000
 tried but I pushed him with a command 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.610
 if you are interested this is the command 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 here then slash summon zombie 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.990
 coordinates that you choose and then 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 you have to write this pappardella 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.600
 inside the braces where yes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.959
 say he is a zombie see and that he is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.120
 riding a chicken 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.909
 this new variant of mob is also a 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 witness a team quality of 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:21.269
 the development of the musang means the fact 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.640
 who are always very attentive to 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.220
 community desires and proposals 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.739
 of the community as had happened with 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.230
 the effect of rising particles 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.829
 that is, when we fall this here 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.920
 animation still happens that comes 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.989
 accepted a proposal by 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 so from minecraft users it is you must 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.030
 know this this animation 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.370
 of particles is not an original idea 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
 of the mot zhang and but derives precisely from 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.019
 a proposal from a user 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.200
 similarly this this variant 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.859
 ie the chicken jockey was 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.160
 proposed by a user on reddit and dinner 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:05.120
 good saw this particular idea has 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.599
 decided to implement this in the game 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.730
 small mob that looks very puccioso but 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.099
 which will surely give us a thread from 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.470
 so twist this just to say 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.500
 that the motion development team that 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.010
 once again it shows very much 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.200
 be careful what your community says 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.599
 then I showed you the mobbing if 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.500
 maybe we don't have another because 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.880
 we must try to see how much it is 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.620
 dangerous 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.959
 I showed him how to marry the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.750
 command and therefore there remains nothing but 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.900
 see how it behaves then let's go 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.700
 in survival mode then 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.930
 zero mode and let's see what the fuck he is doing 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:57.000
 is following us or maybe not if it fits 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.799
 following ok the hen fan 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.230
 then that fucking non- crazy the same 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.280
 that occasionally starts to fly to 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.579
 jumping is not like other mobs that 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.769
 they ride other mobs once they do 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.160
 get for the command summon ie for 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:17.400
 example if we play a zombie above 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.600
 a bat is not the zombie it is 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.420
 check but the bat he wants 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.430
 and he carries the zombie with him in this 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.530
 case it is just the mini zombie that is 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.200
 checking the chicken then the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.860
 ride and check it carefully 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.230
 it's very different from the spawn areas a mob 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.450
 who rides another bob because in 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.080
 in this case there is really an intelligence 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.540
 artificial particular in which the zombie 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.770
 baby telling the hen what to do 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.920
 then the guide rides the door 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:56.110
 in short, it was very interesting 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.360
 also very fast think maybe when 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.760
 we escape from the zombies throwing ourselves 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.570
 down from a height to fall into the water 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.210
 in this case their cc will follow type 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.070
 they will come down flying and it will be a thing 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.110
 quite epic 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.660
 so now I want to go back to mode 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.540
 creative and maybe do just one 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.850
 example of something because it interests me 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.280
 particularly 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.410
 then guys let's try to throw it out of 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.800
 below to see how it behaves like the 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.800
 flight 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.640
 ok conferred network is coming down 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:36.160
 slowly really funny to see and is 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.730
 cool from enav and the idea could 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.710
 put it type in some revised maps 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.860
 maybe there are little zombies on them 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.080
 hens flying from above and yes 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.490
 they attack from above I think he can 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.980
 prove to be far more useful than it is 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.820
 this seems to be this small variant 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.470
 of mobs in my opinion could reveal us 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.350
 interesting surprises 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.900
 beyond that the rest of the snap 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.600
 shot like I said and how it was 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.210
 for the last snapshot contains 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.570
 only bug fixes and there's not much to 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.200
 say except that I can tell you that it is 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.230
 Object rendering has been fixed 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.570
 at long distances I can't make you now 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.180
 really see what it is 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.550
 why should I put then where we are 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.950
 I should put the rendering distance 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.729
 at most I don't do it because otherwise 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.210
 I like to widen the game 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.610
 register and for which anyway it is approved 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.080
 you if you play with the distance of 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.839
 rendering at most in the version 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.419
 1.7.2 there were effects in the 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:49.069
 rendering of objects while with 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.159
 this snapshots have been set 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:54.289
 these problems and therefore also to one 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:58.639
 long distance we can see 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:00.860
 distinctly the blocks and colors of the 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.449
 blocks with a real definition 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.930
 very high I have seen from some 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:08.990
 screenshot and I must say that it is not at all 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.180
 bad he also said about these bug fixes 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:17.539
 and of what the new we have seen 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.309
 for this snap shot it's all for the 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:23.449
 next week we can already 

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:28.189
 wait for the pre realize of the 1.7 point 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:31.399
 3 so I'll do a video on the 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:33.800
 open the ice and then when the 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:34.999
 official version I will publish it for 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.979
 explain yourself well 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:39.169
 in detail what it introduces even if 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:42.469
 very few things to say 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:45.439
 mainly we talk about switches and 

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:48.139
 so this little one is also revealed 

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:49.879
 News said it really is everything 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.449
 so I put myself in my classic 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:55.999
 pose maybe we go walking with the 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:58.099
 moonwalk look how pro we are go 

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:00.229
 close to the little zombies to greet you 

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:03.499
 so we'll see another video 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:06.729
 a greeting from ehren place and the next 

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.729
 Hi everyone 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.840
 mom dad
