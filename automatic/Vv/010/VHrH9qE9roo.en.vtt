00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.160 

yeah<00:00:04.160> what<00:00:04.910> appears<00:00:05.149> to<00:00:05.210> be<00:00:05.300> a<00:00:05.330> Mugen<00:00:05.689> yes

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
yeah what appears to be a Mugen yes

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.430 
yeah what appears to be a Mugen yes
Mugen<00:00:06.979> MTX<00:00:07.490> for<00:00:07.819> and<00:00:08.120> actually<00:00:09.049> I<00:00:09.290> brought

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
Mugen MTX for and actually I brought

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.100 
Mugen MTX for and actually I brought
this<00:00:09.590> in<00:00:09.799> for<00:00:09.950> a<00:00:10.010> different<00:00:10.280> how-to<00:00:10.490> today<00:00:11.110> and

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
this in for a different how-to today and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.500 
this in for a different how-to today and
while<00:00:12.320> staring<00:00:12.709> at<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:12.980> I<00:00:13.129> noticed<00:00:13.670> that<00:00:14.000> the

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
while staring at it I noticed that the

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.930 
while staring at it I noticed that the
previous<00:00:14.900> builder<00:00:15.350> did<00:00:16.100> not<00:00:16.250> set<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.550> belt

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
previous builder did not set the belt

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.870 
previous builder did not set the belt
tension<00:00:17.359> correctly<00:00:17.900> was<00:00:18.830> not<00:00:18.980> me<00:00:19.130> was<00:00:19.369> not<00:00:19.550> Bob

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
tension correctly was not me was not Bob

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.450 
tension correctly was not me was not Bob
this<00:00:20.119> time<00:00:20.359> it<00:00:21.320> was<00:00:21.439> one<00:00:21.589> of<00:00:21.619> our<00:00:21.830> racing

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
this time it was one of our racing

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.450 
this time it was one of our racing
buddies<00:00:23.230> but<00:00:24.230> maybe<00:00:24.859> it<00:00:25.039> wasn't<00:00:25.220> his<00:00:25.429> fault

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
buddies but maybe it wasn't his fault

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.609 
buddies but maybe it wasn't his fault
maybe<00:00:25.880> it<00:00:25.999> was<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.570> Bell<00:00:26.720> had<00:00:26.960> just<00:00:27.140> broken<00:00:27.320> in

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
maybe it was the Bell had just broken in

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.730 
maybe it was the Bell had just broken in
and<00:00:27.859> he<00:00:27.980> didn't<00:00:28.189> reset<00:00:28.579> it<00:00:28.730> but<00:00:29.480> I<00:00:29.779> figured<00:00:30.499> why

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
and he didn't reset it but I figured why

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.970 
and he didn't reset it but I figured why
not<00:00:30.800> to<00:00:31.220> talk<00:00:31.490> about<00:00:31.699> tensions<00:00:32.689> yes<00:00:33.560> they're

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
not to talk about tensions yes they're

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.120 
not to talk about tensions yes they're
important<00:00:34.670> reasons<00:00:34.910> for<00:00:35.950> taking<00:00:36.950> care<00:00:37.070> of

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
important reasons for taking care of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.250 
important reasons for taking care of
your<00:00:37.340> belts<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:38.120> don't<00:00:38.330> want<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.810> cause

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
your belts you don't want to cause

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.540 
your belts you don't want to cause
unnecessary<00:00:40.780> drag<00:00:41.780> on<00:00:42.170> your<00:00:42.230> drivetrain<00:00:42.560> now

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
unnecessary drag on your drivetrain now

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.640 
unnecessary drag on your drivetrain now
or<00:00:43.850> any<00:00:44.270> unnecessary<00:00:44.690> wear<00:00:45.260> on<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.500> belt

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
or any unnecessary wear on the belt

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.530 
or any unnecessary wear on the belt
itself<00:00:45.950> because<00:00:46.370> they're<00:00:46.700> not<00:00:46.880> cheap<00:00:47.090> yeah

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
itself because they're not cheap yeah

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.470 
itself because they're not cheap yeah
that's<00:00:48.170> exactly<00:00:48.350> right<00:00:48.770> there's<00:00:49.340> there's<00:00:49.760> two

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
that's exactly right there's there's two

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.440 
that's exactly right there's there's two
different<00:00:51.410> ends<00:00:51.740> of<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.890> spectrum<00:00:52.120> as<00:00:53.120> far<00:00:53.330> as

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
different ends of the spectrum as far as

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.220 
different ends of the spectrum as far as
problems<00:00:54.170> or<00:00:54.290> concerns<00:00:54.490> for<00:00:55.490> the<00:00:55.580> belt<00:00:56.230> too

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
problems or concerns for the belt too

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.100 
problems or concerns for the belt too
tight<00:00:57.940> like<00:00:58.940> Bob<00:00:59.150> mentioned<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.690> will<00:00:59.840> cause

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
tight like Bob mentioned it will cause

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.160 
tight like Bob mentioned it will cause
parasitic<00:01:01.070> drag<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.660> you<00:01:02.660> have<00:01:02.780> thrown<00:01:03.050> up

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
parasitic drag and you have thrown up

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.100 
parasitic drag and you have thrown up
big<00:01:03.380> words<00:01:03.620> like<00:01:04.509> wait<00:01:05.509> till<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:05.750> start<00:01:05.840> talking

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
big words like wait till I start talking

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.590 
big words like wait till I start talking
about<00:01:06.320> about<00:01:06.590> deflection<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:11.240> start<00:01:11.420> using

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
about about deflection just start using

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.569 
about about deflection just start using
big<00:01:11.929> words<00:01:15.759> but<00:01:16.759> anyway<00:01:17.499> so<00:01:18.499> yes<00:01:18.710> parasitic

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
big words but anyway so yes parasitic

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.429 
big words but anyway so yes parasitic
drag<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:20.090> means<00:01:20.299> when<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.079> let<00:01:21.229> off<00:01:21.319> the

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
drag that means when you let off the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.529 
drag that means when you let off the
throttle<00:01:21.490> you're<00:01:22.490> technically<00:01:23.149> your<00:01:23.299> wheels

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
throttle you're technically your wheels

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.109 
throttle you're technically your wheels
should<00:01:23.899> free<00:01:24.229> spin<00:01:24.579> but<00:01:25.579> if<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.909> belt

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
should free spin but if the belt

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.910 
should free spin but if the belt
tensioner<00:01:26.749> is<00:01:26.840> too<00:01:27.020> tight<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:27.649> going<00:01:27.859> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
tensioner is too tight it's going to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.940 
tensioner is too tight it's going to
slow<00:01:28.359> that<00:01:29.359> drivetrain<00:01:29.990> down<00:01:30.200> rapidly<00:01:30.619> and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
slow that drivetrain down rapidly and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.029 
slow that drivetrain down rapidly and
that<00:01:31.399> could<00:01:31.670> cause<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:33.170> know<00:01:33.319> lower<00:01:33.770> lap

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
that could cause you know lower lap

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.090 
that could cause you know lower lap
times<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:35.840> could<00:01:35.990> make<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.409> car<00:01:36.649> feel<00:01:36.889> like

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
times it could make the car feel like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.819 
times it could make the car feel like
it's<00:01:37.280> not<00:01:37.399> braking<00:01:37.999> properly<00:01:38.569> or<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:39.469> feels

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
it's not braking properly or it feels

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.059 
it's not braking properly or it feels
like<00:01:40.039> it<00:01:40.219> is<00:01:40.249> braking<00:01:40.880> when<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.149> shouldn't<00:01:41.509> be

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
like it is braking when it shouldn't be

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.989 
like it is braking when it shouldn't be
be<00:01:43.069> RAK<00:01:43.759> hmm<00:01:45.069> what<00:01:46.069> are<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.219> sucking<00:01:46.429> a-rockin

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
be RAK hmm what are you sucking a-rockin

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:51.429 
be RAK hmm what are you sucking a-rockin
yeah<00:01:47.329> then<00:01:48.079> you're<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.479> other<00:01:50.659> end<00:01:50.899> it

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
yeah then you're on the other end it

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.679 
yeah then you're on the other end it
could<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.709> too<00:01:51.920> loose<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.329> mentioned

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
could be too loose and as I mentioned

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.209 
could be too loose and as I mentioned
that<00:01:53.780> could<00:01:53.959> cause<00:01:54.109> belt<00:01:54.439> where<00:01:56.109> where

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
that could cause belt where where

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.559 
that could cause belt where where
basically<00:01:58.219> the<00:01:58.490> belt<00:01:58.670> will<00:01:58.939> start<00:01:59.119> skipping

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
basically the belt will start skipping

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.300 
basically the belt will start skipping
over<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.929> teeth<00:02:00.139> and<00:02:00.499> as<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.859> starts<00:02:01.130> skipping

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
over the teeth and as it starts skipping

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.769 
over the teeth and as it starts skipping
over<00:02:01.520> teeth<00:02:01.850> you'll<00:02:02.060> hear<00:02:02.209> a<00:02:02.240> little<00:02:02.329> clicking

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
over teeth you'll hear a little clicking

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.330 
over teeth you'll hear a little clicking
noise<00:02:02.959> so<00:02:03.229> that's<00:02:03.409> an<00:02:03.649> indicator<00:02:04.039> that

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
noise so that's an indicator that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.859 
noise so that's an indicator that
probably<00:02:04.999> needed<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.299> tighten<00:02:05.479> your<00:02:05.600> belt

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
probably needed to tighten your belt

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.040 
probably needed to tighten your belt
tension<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:07.130> as<00:02:07.279> its<00:02:07.520> as<00:02:07.700> its<00:02:08.060> click<00:02:08.360> ads<00:02:08.569> FL

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
tension and as its as its click ads FL

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.630 
tension and as its as its click ads FL
is<00:02:09.229> going<00:02:09.530> over<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.830> pulley<00:02:10.069> and<00:02:10.250> clicking

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is going over that pulley and clicking

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.699 
is going over that pulley and clicking
on<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.910> teeth<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.659> wearing<00:02:12.170> away<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.530> that

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
on the teeth it's wearing away at that

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.259 
on the teeth it's wearing away at that
pulley<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.580> wearing<00:02:13.790> away<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
pulley is actually wearing away at the

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.150 
pulley is actually wearing away at the
belt<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:14.659> well<00:02:14.689> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
belt as well and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.560 
belt as well and
what<00:02:16.340> does<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.490> lead<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.940> gotta<00:02:17.300> go<00:02:17.420> buy

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
what does that lead to I gotta go buy

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.840 
what does that lead to I gotta go buy
more<00:02:17.810> parts<00:02:18.080> from<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> hobby<00:02:18.440> shop<00:02:18.560> because<00:02:19.520> I

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
more parts from the hobby shop because I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.340 
more parts from the hobby shop because I
didn't<00:02:20.090> take<00:02:20.240> two<00:02:20.420> seconds<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.930> tension

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
didn't take two seconds to tension

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.190 
didn't take two seconds to tension
develop<00:02:21.940> so<00:02:22.940> what's<00:02:23.300> cool<00:02:23.420> about<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.780> Mugen

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
develop so what's cool about this Mugen

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.980 
develop so what's cool about this Mugen
car<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.340> side<00:02:25.670> belt<00:02:25.940> does<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.690> ball

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990

different types of tensioners depending
on<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.060> car<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.600> have<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:34.190> this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
on the car that you have but this

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720 
on the car that you have but this
specific<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.240> here<00:02:36.040> well<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.250> should<00:02:37.400> say<00:02:37.550> most

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
specific one here well I should say most

bearing<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.410> we<00:02:42.710> have<00:02:42.860> ears<00:02:43.070> we've<00:02:43.460> got<00:02:43.640> two

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
bearing so we have ears we've got two

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.000 
bearing so we have ears we've got two
bearings<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.570> basically<00:02:45.020> push<00:02:45.260> down<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
bearings that basically push down on the

screwdriver and just flex the belt see
what<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.580> belt<00:03:07.760> deflection<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.930> you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
what the belt deflection it is on it you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.290 
what the belt deflection it is on it you
just<00:03:09.470> want<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.860> few<00:03:10.010> few<00:03:10.550> mil<00:03:10.760> maker<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:11.210> you

spot I'll show you what crazy so see how
sloppy<00:03:23.090> sloppy<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.720> belt<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.080> that'll

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
sloppy sloppy that belt is that'll

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.440 
sloppy sloppy that belt is that'll
actually<00:03:25.040> cause<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.550> belt<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:26.150> skip

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
actually cause the belt to just skip

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.440 
actually cause the belt to just skip
over<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.810> over<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.320> teeth<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.330> you're<00:03:29.330> gonna

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
over the over the teeth and you're gonna

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.120 
over the over the teeth and you're gonna
lose<00:03:29.660> power<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.380> got<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.590> wear<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.800> parts

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
lose power you got to wear the parts

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.220 
lose power you got to wear the parts
just<00:03:32.000> not<00:03:32.270> going<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> work<00:03:32.570> very<00:03:32.600> well<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:33.140> what

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
just not going to work very well so what

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.449 
just not going to work very well so what
you<00:03:33.260> want<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> do<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:34.250> basically<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:36.250> set<00:03:37.250> a

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
you want to do is basically to to set a

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.860 
you want to do is basically to to set a
side<00:03:37.790> belt<00:03:38.000> tensioner<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.540> just<00:03:38.690> want<00:03:38.840> to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
side belt tensioner you just want to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.050 
side belt tensioner you just want to
drop<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.200> down<00:03:39.230> let<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.100> fall<00:03:40.310> on<00:03:40.340> its<00:03:40.610> own<00:03:40.760> just

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
drop it down let it fall on its own just

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.350 
drop it down let it fall on its own just
give<00:03:41.240> it<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.420> little<00:03:41.840> bit<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.260> pressure<00:03:43.360> tighten

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
give it a little bit of pressure tighten

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.830 
give it a little bit of pressure tighten
it<00:03:44.450> down<00:03:45.010> then<00:03:46.010> check<00:03:46.400> that<00:03:46.640> large<00:03:47.030> area<00:03:47.420> for

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
it down then check that large area for

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.110 
it down then check that large area for
deflection<00:03:48.800> again<00:03:49.190> as<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.850> see<00:03:49.970> it's

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
deflection again as you can see it's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.510 
deflection again as you can see it's
just<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.330> few<00:03:50.510> millimeters<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.280> you're<00:03:52.280> pretty

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
just a few millimeters and you're pretty

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.110 
just a few millimeters and you're pretty
much<00:03:52.670> ready<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:52.970> go<00:03:53.090> now<00:03:54.370> on<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.610> car<00:03:55.880> it's<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
much ready to go now on this car it's a

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.440 
much ready to go now on this car it's a
triple<00:03:56.390> belt<00:03:56.570> car<00:03:56.780> once<00:03:56.989> you<00:03:57.080> back<00:03:57.230> out<00:03:57.380> okay

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
triple belt car once you back out okay

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.880 
triple belt car once you back out okay
can't<00:03:59.450> really<00:04:00.489> really<00:04:01.489> show<00:04:02.620> inside<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.770> it

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
can't really really show inside of it

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.330 
can't really really show inside of it
but<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.350> front<00:04:06.350> rear<00:04:06.500> bulkheads<00:04:07.010> there

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
but in the front rear bulkheads there

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.290 
but in the front rear bulkheads there
are<00:04:07.660> like<00:04:08.660> eccentric<00:04:09.200> wings<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
are like eccentric wings that the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.930 
are like eccentric wings that the
bearings<00:04:11.690> go<00:04:11.810> on<00:04:11.959> for<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.230> diff<00:04:12.410> pulleys<00:04:12.940> now

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
bearings go on for the diff pulleys now

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.250 
bearings go on for the diff pulleys now
with<00:04:14.150> these<00:04:14.300> eccentric<00:04:14.630> rings<00:04:14.989> what<00:04:15.200> you

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
with these eccentric rings what you

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.840 
with these eccentric rings what you
could<00:04:15.380> do<00:04:15.440> is<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.620> could<00:04:15.739> twist<00:04:16.040> them<00:04:16.220> on<00:04:16.580> both

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
could do is you could twist them on both

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.560 
could do is you could twist them on both
sides<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:18.950> will<00:04:19.010> tension<00:04:19.790> or<00:04:20.000> loosen

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
sides and that will tension or loosen

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.600 
sides and that will tension or loosen
the<00:04:20.870> belt<00:04:21.020> and<00:04:21.650> again<00:04:22.010> just<00:04:22.250> take<00:04:22.460> your

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
the belt and again just take your

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.529 
the belt and again just take your
screwdriver<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.650> push<00:04:24.650> down<00:04:24.860> on<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
screwdriver and push down on the the

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.659 
screwdriver and push down on the the
belt<00:04:26.750> see<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:27.740> got<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.010> one<00:04:28.220> millimeter

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
belt see if it's got that one millimeter

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:29.620 
belt see if it's got that one millimeter
flex<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.270> flex

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
flex to flex

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.300 
flex to flex
or<00:04:29.930> 2<00:04:30.080> millimeter<00:04:30.260> deflection<00:04:30.920> this<00:04:31.100> looks

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
or 2 millimeter deflection this looks

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.870 
or 2 millimeter deflection this looks
pretty<00:04:31.460> good<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:33.260> got<00:04:33.500> like<00:04:33.590> 4<00:04:33.980> total<00:04:34.760> up

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
pretty good so you got like 4 total up

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.130 
pretty good so you got like 4 total up
and<00:04:35.030> down<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:35.600> two<00:04:35.900> down<00:04:36.050> two<00:04:36.320> up<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.960> that's

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
and down so two down two up and that's

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.670 
and down so two down two up and that's
usually<00:04:39.290> pretty<00:04:39.470> good<00:04:40.780> tension<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:42.650> know

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
usually pretty good tension you know

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.050 
usually pretty good tension you know
check<00:04:42.980> check<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.430> wheels<00:04:43.610> if<00:04:43.940> they're

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
check check the wheels if they're

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180 
check check the wheels if they're
spinning<00:04:44.300> free<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.590> know<00:04:45.710> your<00:04:45.950> belt

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
spinning free and you know your belt

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.640 
spinning free and you know your belt
tension<00:04:46.550> is<00:04:46.610> probably<00:04:46.880> fine<00:04:47.120> as<00:04:47.270> well<00:04:47.420> but<00:04:48.230> you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
tension is probably fine as well but you

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.710 
tension is probably fine as well but you
definitely<00:04:49.040> don't<00:04:49.160> want<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.520> very<00:04:50.180> sloppy<00:04:50.510> belt

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
definitely don't want a very sloppy belt

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.830 
definitely don't want a very sloppy belt
mm-hmm<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:52.130> goes<00:04:52.340> for<00:04:52.520> anything<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:53.720> then

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
mm-hmm it goes for anything and then

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.380 
mm-hmm it goes for anything and then
check<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> rear<00:04:54.410> as<00:04:54.530> well<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.940> belt<00:04:56.330> is

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
check the rear as well this belt is

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.360 
check the rear as well this belt is
actually<00:04:56.720> pretty<00:04:56.930> tight<00:04:57.200> actually<00:04:58.130> probably

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
actually pretty tight actually probably

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.560 
actually pretty tight actually probably
said<00:04:58.610> let's<00:04:58.790> zoom<00:04:59.000> back<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.180> for<00:04:59.450> that<00:04:59.540> one

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
said let's zoom back in for that one

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.540 
said let's zoom back in for that one
okay<00:05:04.030> get<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.210> shot<00:05:05.390> there<00:05:05.900> good<00:05:06.530> see<00:05:06.890> I<00:05:07.130> mean

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
okay get a shot there good see I mean

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.400 
okay get a shot there good see I mean
we've<00:05:07.850> got<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.090> very<00:05:08.450> little<00:05:08.720> deflection<00:05:09.260> there

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
we've got a very little deflection there

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.170 
we've got a very little deflection there
so<00:05:09.560> that's<00:05:09.740> actually<00:05:10.100> causing<00:05:10.310> drag<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:11.090> the

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
so that's actually causing drag on the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.210 
so that's actually causing drag on the
rear<00:05:11.390> of<00:05:11.420> the<00:05:11.570> car<00:05:11.810> make<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.620> car<00:05:12.830> feel<00:05:13.040> like

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
rear of the car make the car feel like

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.920 
rear of the car make the car feel like
it's<00:05:13.400> breaking<00:05:13.610> going<00:05:14.090> into<00:05:14.330> corners<00:05:14.660> when

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
it's breaking going into corners when

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.600 
it's breaking going into corners when
you're<00:05:15.050> letting<00:05:15.320> off<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.470> throttle<00:05:15.620> so<00:05:16.490> you

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
you're letting off the throttle so you

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.990 
you're letting off the throttle so you
got<00:05:16.730> to<00:05:16.790> do<00:05:16.850> like<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.330> mentioned<00:05:17.780> take<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.050> apart

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
got to do like I mentioned take it apart

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.950 
got to do like I mentioned take it apart
unfortunately<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.330> know<00:05:20.390> some<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.720> cars

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
unfortunately you know some of the cars

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.630 
unfortunately you know some of the cars
