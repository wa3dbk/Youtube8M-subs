starting lineup is back you expect to be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090

able<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> replace<00:01:57.750> those<00:01:58.049> points<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
able to replace those points with the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.450 
able to replace those points with the
experience<00:01:59.930> yeah<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> pretty

stuff<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.190> healthy<00:02:13.850> then<00:02:14.150> he'll<00:02:15.020> score<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.380> lot

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650

for<00:02:16.010> us<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.490> but<00:02:17.390> our<00:02:18.020> team<00:02:18.260> starts<00:02:18.710> with<00:02:18.920> Ryan

high low and not to be mutually

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.910 
high low and not to be mutually
exclusive<00:02:26.270> but<00:02:26.450> where<00:02:27.230> they<00:02:27.590> should<00:02:27.800> be<00:02:27.830> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
exclusive but where they should be a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.270

tandem<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.960> they're<00:02:29.960> both<00:02:30.140> seniors<00:02:30.680> their

tandem and they're both seniors their
accomplished<00:02:31.760> players<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.360> think<00:02:32.650> Mason<00:02:33.650> has<00:02:33.800> a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
accomplished players I think Mason has a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.410 
accomplished players I think Mason has a
chance<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.550> good<00:02:34.700> at<00:02:34.820> players<00:02:35.060> there<00:02:35.390> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
chance to be as good at players there is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
chance to be as good at players there is
in<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> country<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:38.030> they<00:02:38.270> can<00:02:38.480> provide

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
in the country and if they can provide

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.530 
in the country and if they can provide
the<00:02:39.080> consistency<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.340> need<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:41.360> you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the consistency that we need where you

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.990 
the consistency that we need where you
could<00:02:41.720> get<00:02:41.930> 35<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.740> 40<00:02:43.070> points<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.520> game<00:02:43.700> from

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
could get 35 to 40 points a game from

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120 
could get 35 to 40 points a game from
them<00:02:44.210> you<00:02:45.050> know<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.230> both<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> them<00:02:45.650> come<00:02:45.890> close

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
them you know if both of them come close

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.670 
them you know if both of them come close
to<00:02:46.370> double<00:02:46.670> figure<00:02:46.970> rebounds<00:02:47.540> then<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.470> have

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
to double figure rebounds then you have

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.260 
to double figure rebounds then you have
something<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.160> most<00:02:49.490> people<00:02:49.640> don't<00:02:50.180> have

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
something that most people don't have

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.550 
something that most people don't have
and<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.770> would<00:02:51.920> give<00:02:52.100> confidence<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.820> our<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and that would give confidence to our a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.320 
and that would give confidence to our a
perimeter<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.950> think<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.580> fairly

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
perimeter that I think can be fairly

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.750

deep<00:02:56.690> for<00:02:56.960> us<00:02:56.990> obviously<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:58.130> bring<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.490> great

deep for us obviously you bring in great

versatile<00:03:22.490> too<00:03:22.700> he<00:03:22.850> can<00:03:23.030> play<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:23.600> little<00:03:24.080> bit

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
versatile too he can play a little bit

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.760 
versatile too he can play a little bit
inside<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.040> outside<00:03:25.750> 68<00:03:26.750> he<00:03:26.959> has<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.080> 71

inside and outside 68 he has a 71
wingspan<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.870> if<00:03:29.990> we<00:03:30.050> can<00:03:30.260> get<00:03:30.410> them<00:03:30.530> to

of player had in the late 80s Billy King

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.990 
of player had in the late 80s Billy King
who<00:03:38.800> didn't<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.920> position<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:40.760> he<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
winner was our captain you know was a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.449 
winner was our captain you know was a
significant<00:03:45.080> factor<00:03:45.290> in<00:03:45.590> us<00:03:45.830> being<00:03:46.100> really

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
significant factor in us being really

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.730 
significant factor in us being really
good<00:03:46.750> during<00:03:47.750> that<00:03:47.900> period<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.320> time<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.530> think

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
good during that period of time I think

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:57.650 
good during that period of time I think
a<00:03:49.040> meal<00:03:49.250> was<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.490> little<00:03:49.790> bit<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.120> him

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.450 

I<00:03:57.780> think<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.320> should<00:03:58.500> look<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.920> season<00:03:59.160> as

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
I think you should look at the season as

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.790 
I think you should look at the season as
a<00:03:59.490> whole<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:00.180> what<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> take<00:04:01.050> from<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> whole

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
a whole and what you take from the whole

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.760 
a whole and what you take from the whole
season<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.460> why<00:04:02.750> we<00:04:03.750> were<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.140> good<00:04:04.410> at<00:04:04.620> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
season and why we were not good at the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.130 
season and why we were not good at the
end<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.280> not<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.790> blame<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.210> just<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:06.840> we

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
end and not to blame it just and what we

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.200 
end and not to blame it just and what we
lost<00:04:07.320> Ryan<00:04:07.650> Kelly<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.250> significant<00:04:09.030> loss

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
lost Ryan Kelly this is significant loss

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.110 
lost Ryan Kelly this is significant loss
in<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.600> last<00:04:09.840> week<00:04:10.170> but<00:04:11.130> for<00:04:11.430> some<00:04:11.610> reason<00:04:11.970> we

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
in the last week but for some reason we

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.060 
in the last week but for some reason we
weren't<00:04:12.360> as<00:04:12.630> energetic<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.500> thought<00:04:13.800> we<00:04:13.980> were

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
weren't as energetic I thought we were

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.870 
weren't as energetic I thought we were
real<00:04:14.280> tired<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:16.070> we<00:04:17.070> never<00:04:17.250> became<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
real tired and we never became the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.640 
real tired and we never became the
defensive<00:04:18.510> team<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.080> need<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.500> be

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
defensive team that you need to be

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.160 
defensive team that you need to be
especially<00:04:19.950> going<00:04:20.459> into<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:21.540> NC<00:04:21.840> double-a

especially going into the NC double-a
tournament<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.920> don't<00:04:23.610> want<00:04:23.850> us<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.750> be

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
tournament I don't want us to be

tournament I don't want us to be
