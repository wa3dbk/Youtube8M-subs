00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.249 
there
oh<00:01:13.580> maybe<00:01:14.240> thread<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.750> one<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.080> try<00:01:15.200> to

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
oh maybe thread that one and try to

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.060 
oh maybe thread that one and try to
replicate<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:18.369> can't<00:01:19.369> replicate<00:01:19.610> it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
replicate it can't replicate it

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.430 
replicate it can't replicate it
just<00:01:21.640> sucks<00:01:21.940> it's<00:01:22.480> been<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:22.720> while<00:01:23.020> since<00:01:23.290> you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
just sucks it's been a while since you

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.810 
just sucks it's been a while since you
try<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> ride<00:01:23.979> something<00:01:24.310> like<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.550> around

here<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.090> then<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.290> just<00:01:26.440> stare<00:01:26.710> it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
here and then then you just stare it

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.350 
here and then then you just stare it
like<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> Autons<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.729> work<00:01:27.940> that<00:01:28.060> one<00:01:28.210> could

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
like the Autons can work that one could

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.270 
like the Autons can work that one could
work<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:29.290> then<00:01:29.410> you're<00:01:29.530> like<00:01:29.620> try<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.920> make<00:01:30.070> it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280

work and then you're like try to make it
work<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.700> just<00:01:30.760> remember<00:01:31.270> you're<00:01:31.510> like

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
work and you just remember you're like

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.400 
work and you just remember you're like
everything<00:01:32.350> none<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.580> works<00:01:34.200> I'll<00:01:35.200> even

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
everything none of it works I'll even

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.050 
everything none of it works I'll even
take<00:01:35.560> my<00:01:35.740> downhill<00:01:36.070> bike<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.460> dirt<00:01:36.700> jumps

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.750 
take my downhill bike to the dirt jumps
and<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.540> ride<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.900> jumps<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.260> my<00:01:38.380> yard

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
and and ride the jumps in my yard

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.370 
and and ride the jumps in my yard
because<00:01:39.760> it's<00:01:40.150> it's<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.869> only<00:01:41.050> thing<00:01:41.320> you

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
because it's it's the only thing you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.440 
because it's it's the only thing you
need<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.619> think<00:01:41.710> about<00:01:42.160> it<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.460> doesn't<00:01:42.820> it's

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
need to think about it it doesn't it's

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.150 
need to think about it it doesn't it's
not<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.750> cool<00:01:43.930> riding<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.440> downhill<00:01:44.650> bike<00:01:44.830> on

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
not that cool riding a downhill bike on

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.280 
not that cool riding a downhill bike on
jumps<00:01:45.580> with<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:45.970> half-shell<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:47.140> seems

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
jumps with a half-shell it just seems

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.630 
jumps with a half-shell it just seems
kind<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.560> dumb<00:01:47.770> but<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.190> comes<00:01:48.400> down<00:01:48.580> to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
kind of dumb but it comes down to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
kind of dumb but it comes down to
overall<00:01:49.090> bike<00:01:49.300> handling<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.610> cojones<00:01:51.610> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
overall bike handling and cojones and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.529 
overall bike handling and cojones and
I've<00:01:53.200> been<00:01:53.619> lucky<00:01:53.860> enough<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.270> not<00:01:55.270> really<00:01:55.450> be

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
I've been lucky enough to not really be

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.120 
I've been lucky enough to not really be
scared<00:01:55.899> of<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.020> kind<00:01:56.259> of<00:01:56.289> stuff<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:56.740> that

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
scared of that kind of stuff so that

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.490 
scared of that kind of stuff so that
that<00:01:57.520> comes<00:01:57.759> easy<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.090> me<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.300> guess<00:01:58.570> but<00:01:59.259> it's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
that comes easy to me I guess but it's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.410 
that comes easy to me I guess but it's
just<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.190> matter<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.789> feeling<00:02:01.060> good<00:02:01.180> on<00:02:01.330> your

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
just a matter of feeling good on your

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.690 
just a matter of feeling good on your
bike<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.869> being<00:02:02.170> ready<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.530> send<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.310> if

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
bike and being ready to send it and if

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.600 
bike and being ready to send it and if
and<00:02:03.970> if<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.149> feel<00:02:04.330> good<00:02:04.360> on<00:02:04.660> your<00:02:04.780> bike<00:02:04.960> you're

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and if you feel good on your bike you're

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.570 
and if you feel good on your bike you're
feel<00:02:06.610> better<00:02:06.850> about<00:02:07.030> sending<00:02:07.450> it
