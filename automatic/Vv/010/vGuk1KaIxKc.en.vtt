00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.000
 and oh nice guys I hope that 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.500
 you're well we end up 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.970
 today for the third episode of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.470
 history on call of duty to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.820
 surfers so today I have 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.539
 unfortunately only two historical to 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.400
 offer you 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.259
 so the first story is going to be 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970
 unfold on two different maps while 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.470
 first on the map comeback then he 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.119
 you will just have to direct yourself to 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.160
 spectators in out of map to 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.750
 the highway with a car really 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.339
 disgusting this is probably because and 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.320
 it's really ugly but hey we get it 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.360
 then you will have to go 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.900
 to this car that is crushed 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.870
 against the wall 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.890
 then targeted late by grouping at your 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.570
 camera to the ground 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.340
 going down the ground and there you will see 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.989
 that basically there will be pallets of 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.399
 colors so I do not know at all what 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.170
 that's not what it represents 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.399
 but it's not the only map or related to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.070
 these color palettes I found 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.590
 also on the biolab mat on a 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.789
 roof so as you see on the screen on 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.930
 the roof there we see them much better 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.280
 it's not the two colors so if 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.470
 you know what it is if it's 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.910
 stuff to model the maps or if 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.560
 it's history to hide brief if 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.020
 you have an answer to his do not hesitate 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 skin this guy in comment on this 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.080
 video is then second easter egg on 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.150
 is found on 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.640
 simply the map of the three yes 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.750
 towards this big portal is there of course 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.250
 to listen to it with your ears 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.230
 since it's a jump I'm you 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.730
 lets listen for a few seconds what 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.890
 is happening so that's where we hear 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.960
 a barking dog so it reminded me 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.790
 enormously historical that there was on 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.000
 meetic I had done on ghost on 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.440
 also heard a dog barking 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 meanings for this history 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.020
 I do not know I will try to search 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.270
