00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because the threads don't go all the way

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
because the threads don't go all the way
into<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.680> about

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
into it as you can see it's just about

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.209 
into it as you can see it's just about
maybe<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.939> inch<00:01:54.780> deep<00:01:55.049> inside<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.040> it's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
maybe an inch deep inside of it so it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.420 
maybe an inch deep inside of it so it's
not<00:01:56.340> bad<00:01:57.649> I'll<00:01:58.649> show<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.070> difference

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
not bad I'll show you all a difference

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.270 
not bad I'll show you all a difference
between<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.149> stock<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.409> weather<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
between the stock and the weather this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.679 
between the stock and the weather this
one's<00:02:02.520> gonna<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:02.820> like<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> minute<00:02:03.540> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
one's gonna look like in a minute and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
one's gonna look like in a minute and
height<00:02:04.290> wise<00:02:04.590> but<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> them<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:05.939> pretty

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
height wise but I like them I'm pretty

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.469 
height wise but I like them I'm pretty
much<00:02:06.299> flush<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.049> bottom<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> here

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
much flush at the bottom so do it here

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
much flush at the bottom so do it here
you<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> want<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> tighten<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
you don't want to tighten that all the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.559 
you don't want to tighten that all the
way<00:02:10.950> down<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.330> able<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
way down because you will not be able to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.060 
way down because you will not be able to
get

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
get

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.220 
get
the<00:02:14.490> pattern<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.940> come<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.080> right

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the pattern to come out in the right

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.810 
the pattern to come out in the right
direction<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.520> gonna<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.730> as

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
direction so it's what I'm gonna do as

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820 
direction so it's what I'm gonna do as
long<00:02:17.910> as<00:02:18.030> some<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.270> ahead<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.510> start<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> start

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
long as some go ahead and start it start

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.340 
long as some go ahead and start it start
the<00:02:19.920> threading<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.270> if<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.900> slides<00:02:22.140> on

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
the threading and just if this slides on

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.070 
the threading and just if this slides on
real<00:02:22.560> easy<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.720> tightened<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.750> all<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> way

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
real easy I tightened it all the way

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.660 
real easy I tightened it all the way
down<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.530> where<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.890> is<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.310> basically<00:02:26.490> a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
down to where this is it's basically a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.000 
down to where this is it's basically a
locking<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.120> for<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.410> tell<00:02:28.620> it's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
locking up for it as you can tell it's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
locking up for it as you can tell it's
backwards<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:30.209> what<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.390> got<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> do

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
backwards so what you got to do

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.380 
backwards so what you got to do
it's<00:02:31.170> tighten<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> luck<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.490> retainer<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it's tighten the luck the retainer a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.510 
it's tighten the luck the retainer a
little<00:02:33.600> bit<00:02:33.720> farther<00:02:33.900> down<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.500> turn<00:02:35.340> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
little bit farther down and turn it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.699 
little bit farther down and turn it
that's<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:37.020> takes<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.350> little<00:02:37.440> bit<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
that's it just takes a little bit of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.160 
that's it just takes a little bit of
playing<00:02:37.890> with<00:02:38.160> turn<00:02:38.550> our<00:02:38.730> bottom<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.020> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
playing with turn our bottom one and you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
playing with turn our bottom one and you
can<00:02:40.320> get<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.800> but<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.190> gonna<00:02:41.340> loosen<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
can get it to go but I'm gonna loosen it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:53.770 
can get it to go but I'm gonna loosen it
tad<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.810> there<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.050> go<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.890> nice<00:02:53.100> easy

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
tad bit and there you go it's nice easy

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.190 
tad bit and there you go it's nice easy
put<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:54.959> whatnot<00:02:56.630> show<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.780> difference

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
put it on whatnot show you a difference

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.699 
put it on whatnot show you a difference
in<00:02:58.320> size<00:02:59.870> that's<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> size<00:03:01.170> difference<00:03:01.590> right

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
in size that's the size difference right

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.610 
in size that's the size difference right
there<00:03:01.860> from<00:03:02.130> where<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.300> lot

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
there from where it would be it's a lot

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.110 
there from where it would be it's a lot
thicker<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.770> lot<00:03:04.920> better<00:03:05.100> feel<00:03:05.310> -<00:03:05.489> y'all<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
thicker a lot better feel - y'all have a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750 
thicker a lot better feel - y'all have a
great<00:03:06.270> day<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.480> Merry<00:03:06.959> Christmas<00:03:07.550> I'll<00:03:08.550> talk
