and<00:02:35.650> your<00:02:35.950> thunder<00:02:36.370> clashing<00:02:36.910> sounds

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.400 

now<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.730> did<00:02:45.000> say<00:02:45.239> that<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.480> hammer<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.959> motion

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
now I did say that this hammer is motion

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.280 
now I did say that this hammer is motion
activated<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.700> goes<00:02:48.000> without<00:02:48.750> pressing

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
activated so here goes without pressing

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:02.230 
activated so here goes without pressing
the<00:02:49.379> button

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:14.890 

I<00:03:12.640> didn't<00:03:13.640> think<00:03:13.730> I'd<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:14.180> at<00:03:14.390> first<00:03:14.420> but

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
I didn't think I'd like it at first but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.420 
I didn't think I'd like it at first but
after<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.230> while<00:03:15.440> playing<00:03:15.800> around<00:03:16.010> with<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.220> I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
after a while playing around with it I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.980 
after a while playing around with it I
really<00:03:16.700> do<00:03:16.940> like<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.300> lightning<00:03:17.660> strike

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
really do like the lightning strike

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.080 
really do like the lightning strike
effects<00:03:18.350> on<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.770> hammer<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.850> it<00:03:19.940> looks

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
effects on the hammer and it looks

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.610 
effects on the hammer and it looks
especially<00:03:20.720> cool<00:03:20.930> when<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.230> lights<00:03:21.440> are

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
especially cool when the lights are

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:37.990 
especially cool when the lights are
turned<00:03:21.860> off

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.270 

I<00:03:38.090> really<00:03:39.050> like<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> size<00:03:39.500> of<00:03:39.710> this<00:03:39.830> hammer<00:03:40.100> as

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
I really like the size of this hammer as

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.550 
I really like the size of this hammer as
well<00:03:40.550> I'm<00:03:41.150> not<00:03:41.420> sure<00:03:41.480> if<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.870> one-to-one

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
well I'm not sure if it is one-to-one

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.740 
well I'm not sure if it is one-to-one
scale<00:03:42.740> or<00:03:43.070> not<00:03:43.250> but<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:44.150> big<00:03:44.480> enough<00:03:44.600> to

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
scale or not but it's big enough to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.290 
scale or not but it's big enough to
where<00:03:44.960> I<00:03:45.140> think<00:03:45.620> it'll<00:03:45.800> be<00:03:45.950> fun<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.340> both<00:03:46.820> kids

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
where I think it'll be fun for both kids

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.710 
where I think it'll be fun for both kids
and<00:03:47.480> adults<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:49.730> doesn't<00:03:50.120> look<00:03:50.270> small<00:03:50.570> at

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
and adults and it doesn't look small at

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.290 
and adults and it doesn't look small at
all<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:50.990> my<00:03:51.110> hand<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.680> think<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:52.130> looks<00:03:52.370> almost

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
all in my hand I think it looks almost

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.990 
all in my hand I think it looks almost
about<00:03:53.840> right<00:03:54.140> maybe<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.560> little<00:03:54.830> bit<00:03:55.000> smaller

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
about right maybe a little bit smaller

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.720 
about right maybe a little bit smaller
than<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.330> actual<00:03:56.810> prop<00:03:57.320> use<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.400> movie

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
than the actual prop use of the movie

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.070 
than the actual prop use of the movie
but<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.690> close<00:04:00.230> enough<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.680> me<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.830> like<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:02.080> in

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
but it's close enough to me I like it in

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.500 
but it's close enough to me I like it in
general<00:04:03.680> as<00:04:03.860> far<00:04:03.890> as<00:04:04.220> role<00:04:04.459> play<00:04:04.670> toys<00:04:04.940> go<00:04:05.209> this
