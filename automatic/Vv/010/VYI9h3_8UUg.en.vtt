amount of grease that was just oozing
off<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.630> burger<00:02:36.390> certainly<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.739> promoting

off that burger certainly not promoting

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.690 
off that burger certainly not promoting
a<00:02:38.860> healthy<00:02:38.890> digestion<00:02:39.670> by<00:02:40.000> any<00:02:40.180> means<00:02:41.700> but

a healthy digestion by any means but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.060 
a healthy digestion by any means but
again<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.200> my<00:02:44.380> personal<00:02:44.950> opinion

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
again this is just my personal opinion

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.350 
again this is just my personal opinion
and<00:02:45.579> my<00:02:45.610> body<00:02:46.000> reacting<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> way<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:47.019> does

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
