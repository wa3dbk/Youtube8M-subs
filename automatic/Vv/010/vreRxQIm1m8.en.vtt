00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
player involved you can have probably

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.609 
player involved you can have probably
1012<00:01:58.479> players<00:01:58.899> if<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.110> want<00:01:59.259> them<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.470> play

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
but it works well with 3 4 5 etc and you

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.410 
but it works well with 3 4 5 etc and you
can<00:02:02.920> make<00:02:03.160> pairs<00:02:03.520> out<00:02:03.820> of<00:02:03.910> your<00:02:04.030> hand

throw the pairs in the middle lit and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.040 
throw the pairs in the middle lit and
then<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.340> take<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.880> card<00:02:07.119> from<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.840> first

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
then you take a card from the first

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.359 
then you take a card from the first
person<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.590> left<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> dealer<00:02:09.130> will

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
and then so on and so forth until all

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.479 
and then so on and so forth until all
the<00:02:13.120> pairs<00:02:13.360> are<00:02:13.570> in<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> middle<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.489> one

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
the pairs are in the middle and one

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.190 
the pairs are in the middle and one
person<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:15.850> left<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.239> Queen<00:02:16.480> that's<00:02:17.080> the
