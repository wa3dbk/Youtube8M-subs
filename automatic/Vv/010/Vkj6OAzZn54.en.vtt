00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.320
 all rays of good with you mayor and how are you 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.230
 know in a recent update 141 tanks in 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.960
 war thunder and crossed the stages of the PTA into the experience 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.369
 and that is now they are in the public domain 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.739
 most certainly of you know about this 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.919
 the news is already being successfully cut in the tank 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.930
 however this video is for beginners. 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.149
 who only now saw and learned about 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.160
 this game and want rather into it 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.350
 try in general if you want and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.840
 try then you under the video there 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.190
 link to register in the game 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.800
 accordingly download the client there 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.780
 go into the game and bend down but how 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.030
 usually newbies also have 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.040
 some standard questions when they 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.870
 face something new 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 and here are some of them I'll try 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.430
 Now answer the first question concerns 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.800
 client download speed namely 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.200
 just many of you are very good 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.540
 Internet I'm sure and many again 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.140
 There are questions why I have internet 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.940
 good 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.150
 and shakes with a small speed but 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.290
 still need to understand that returns are coming 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.750
 servers and this speed on them is not 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.310
 infinite is still limited especially 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.470
 you must understand that you are not the only one 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.080
 want to play a game and besides you 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 someone also shakes and I'm sure that such 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.180
 you neither gessi man many 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.640
 more so i just recommend you 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.510
 have patience and go eat 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.670
 make a seagull 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.010
 or do some business because 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.010
 how to play enough you always have time 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.930
 The next question concerns the general customer. 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.630
 or rather, as we know in one 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.430
 not a little-known game there is a separate 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.369
 there is a client for tanks for 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.799
 airplanes here all together that is 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.530
 if you want to play planes or in 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.140
 you only need one customer 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.390
 downloading it you will have access as a tank 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.110
 so to planes nothing extra 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.270
 swing no need to repeat everything together also 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.450
 Many of you will be surprised that there is no HP 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.850
 and probably many of you, this leads to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.009
 stupor so here more play a role 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.810
 modules and damage them but don't think 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.990
 that with every shot you will 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.570
 kill every Rzhev tank is important 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.340
 where do you shoot systems at all 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.310
 Damage did two videos where I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.470
 talked about their damage modules 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.750
 armor and and shells and how they are better 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.880
 apply i will attach these videos in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.100
 annotations well and probably still under video 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.100
 I will also attach so that you can see 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.320
 there everything and a good look right away 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.810
 same in the first battle to wind a bunch of frags and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.640
 become famous in general so all you have 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.890
 was the next important question 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.260
 regarding wipe experience and probably 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.770
 many are interested in this do not want to know 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.410
 answer 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.810
 bt wiping developers nothing at all 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.310
 did not say and did not seem to plan 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.130
 do it at least when 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.560
 the planes went on stage bt wipe not 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 It will hope that here 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.390
 there will be no question about the game 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.830
 process namely artillery here as 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.360
 there is no class and there will not be 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.790
 however there is such a thing and 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.190
 called artillery strikes she 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.750
 not immediately available it is necessary to pump in 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.000
 tank study menu 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.490
 and if you are set on fire or need to 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.950
 fix your damaged internal 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.260
 modules there need to pump two more such 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.040
 the pieces are the first parts to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.020
 repair 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.450
 and the second is a fire extinguisher to 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.180
 respectively extinguish the fire and most importantly 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.890
 Remember that fire extinguishers are only 2 oz combat 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.020
 on the tank that is you only twice 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.640
 You can extinguish on the tank and if in 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.560
 fight time you want to fix 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.080
 damaged module it during their 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.330
 repair the tank will not move however 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.670
 you can shoot the turret 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.490
 this is if of course you are not stuck 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.340
 and most importantly I almost forgot one important thing 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.760
 we are three modes to play it 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.920
 arcade mode realistic simulator on 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.410
 in Arcadia attend mixed 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.110
 setups of teams that is different nations 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.600
 present in combat in realistic with us 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.030
 there are fights nation on nation and 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.880
 the last simulator battles are also battles 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.880
 go national but there are small 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.520
 features 1 we don't have a camera which 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.920
 located behind the tank, we kind of like 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.230
 from the eyes of the commander in general, I will attach 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.019
 link to the review of combat simulators to 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.079
 you could well understand 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.879
 and the second there are no markers hope mode 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.129
 fighting you understand everything and you do not 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:29.039
 get lost when choosing them but in general 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:30.599
 I recommend starting with an arcade and here is my 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.750
 empty head I almost forgot you 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.550
 tell about de su or rather azi threads 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.400
 which can accordingly shoot down 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.889
 planes are now true there in battles flies 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.620
 but i can you practice on 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.750
 their future will already be joint battles with 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.270
 players are more accurate players on 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.110
 aircraft tank players in general will 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270
 full atas 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.060
 in general, such battles were available on forgotten 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.759
 I made some videos where I showed 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.310
 how to bomb planes in a tank and vice versa 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.229
 how to kill in machine tools but also anti-aircraft guns 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.539
 the plane and on this I think you can 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.090
 finish and most importantly go to the game 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.430
 do not forget to go through tank training for 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.380
 he will give you 100 grams and I 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.840
 I hope this video turned out for you 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.880
 informative put huskies 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.240
 subscribe to the channel tell 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.240
