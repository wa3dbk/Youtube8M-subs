all<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.000> pry

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
all I want to do is kind of like pry

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.470 
all I want to do is kind of like pry
down<00:00:51.329> there<00:00:51.660> should<00:00:52.379> come<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:53.480> next

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
down there should come right off next

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
down there should come right off next
step<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.140> will<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:55.710> bolt<00:00:55.920> right

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
step there will be a little bolt right

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.920 
step there will be a little bolt right
inside<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.329> buy<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> shift

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
inside of there and if you buy the shift

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.959 
inside of there and if you buy the shift
knob<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.379> everything<00:00:58.770> should<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
knob then everything should come with it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.349 
knob then everything should come with it
by<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.680> mean<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.670> should<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
by that I mean you should get the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.250 
by that I mean you should get the
required<00:01:04.260> tools<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
everything so this one fits this little

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
everything so this one fits this little
bolt<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.310> saying<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
bolt right in here saying that this is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.899 
bolt right in here saying that this is
still<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> shifter<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.610> gotta<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.880> is

that's out you'll be able to just pull
this<00:01:26.549> shift<00:01:26.880> knob<00:01:27.060> right<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> might

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this shift knob right off and you might

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
this shift knob right off and you might
have<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> kind<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.770> work<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.909> get

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
have to kind of work it like that to get

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.630 
have to kind of work it like that to get
it<00:01:30.150> off<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> slide<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.579> depending<00:01:32.579> on

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it off for it to slide and depending on

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
it off for it to slide and depending on
how<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> sometimes<00:01:34.110> it'll

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
how good it was put on sometimes it'll

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
how good it was put on sometimes it'll
come<00:01:34.470> off<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:34.890> hard<00:01:35.130> sometimes<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.610> won't

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
come off really hard sometimes it won't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
come off really hard sometimes it won't
this<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.270> took<00:01:37.049> probably<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.680> three<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
this one took probably about three to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.469 
this one took probably about three to
four<00:01:38.189> minutes<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.820> shouldn't<00:01:39.240> kill<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
four minutes so it shouldn't kill you

four minutes so it shouldn't kill you
guys<00:01:39.720> would<00:01:39.900> take<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> off<00:01:40.229> shouldn't<00:01:40.619> take

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guys would take it off shouldn't take

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.450 
guys would take it off shouldn't take
all<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.189> long<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> last<00:01:44.250> thing

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
all that long and then the last thing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
all that long and then the last thing
after<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:47.930> you'll<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.049> directions<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.649> for

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
