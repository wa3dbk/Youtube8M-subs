pieces involved in the kit so let's get
stuck<00:00:22.350> into<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:23.930> first<00:00:24.930> thing<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.289> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
stuck into it first thing we're going to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
stuck into it first thing we're going to
do<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.680> before<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.010> turn<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> spanner<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
do here before we turn a spanner is

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.769 
do here before we turn a spanner is
actually<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> record<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
actually going to record the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
actually going to record the
measurements<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> vehicle<00:00:28.859> while<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
measurements of the vehicle while that

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
measurements of the vehicle while that
standard<00:00:29.760> height<00:00:32.480> may<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.600> noticed<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.020> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
standard height may have noticed that I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
standard height may have noticed that I
was<00:00:34.290> measuring<00:00:34.469> from<00:00:34.920> bottom<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> rim<00:00:35.579> to

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
was measuring from bottom of rim to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.150 
was measuring from bottom of rim to
guard<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.960> reason<00:00:37.260> why<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
guard the reason why we do that it's a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.350 
guard the reason why we do that it's a
lot<00:00:38.309> more<00:00:38.340> accurate<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
lot more accurate because it's a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.510 
lot more accurate because it's a
straight<00:00:39.629> line

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.950

impact with the chrome sharp cracking

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.810 
impact with the chrome sharp cracking
that<00:02:33.200> chrome<00:02:33.500> plating<00:02:33.980> will<00:02:34.160> result<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
that chrome plating will result in a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.740 
that chrome plating will result in a
shock<00:02:35.000> absorber<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.330> will<00:02:35.540> work<00:02:35.690> very

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
shock absorber that will work very

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:46.810 
shock absorber that will work very
quickly<00:02:45.250> okay<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.370> we're<00:02:46.490> going<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.730> in

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
quickly okay so we're going to go in

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.760 
quickly okay so we're going to go in
reversal<00:02:47.270> now<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.570> do<00:02:47.660> all<00:02:47.810> these<00:02:48.050> are<00:02:48.350> tired

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
reversal now and do all these are tired

reversal now and do all these are tired
in<00:02:48.950> back<00:02:49.130> up<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.490> other<00:02:49.610> parts<00:02:49.880> back<00:02:50.060> up

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
in back up and the other parts back up

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.790 
in back up and the other parts back up
one<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.230> things<00:02:51.410> are<00:02:51.470> going<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> make<00:02:51.740> sure

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
one of the things are going to make sure

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.070 
one of the things are going to make sure
you<00:02:52.190> do<00:02:52.310> tie<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.090> bolt<00:02:53.300> up<00:02:53.480> here<00:02:53.720> when<00:02:53.990> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you do tie this bolt up here when the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:11.620 
you do tie this bolt up here when the
cars<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> floor

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.240 

okay<00:03:12.630> guys<00:03:12.810> before<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.410> measured<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.830> vehicle

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
okay guys before we measured the vehicle

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.840 
okay guys before we measured the vehicle
we<00:03:14.730> had<00:03:14.940> 800<00:03:15.240> milliliters<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:16.530> droop<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.160> now

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
we had 800 milliliters of droop and now

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.760 
we had 800 milliliters of droop and now
we've<00:03:18.000> got<00:03:18.150> eight<00:03:18.900> hundred<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.320> forty<00:03:19.620> ml

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
we've got eight hundred and forty ml

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.020 
we've got eight hundred and forty ml
which<00:03:19.920> means<00:03:20.130> they've<00:03:20.220> got<00:03:20.250> 40<00:03:20.550> ml<00:03:20.760> more

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
which means they've got 40 ml more

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:30.490 
which means they've got 40 ml more
travel<00:03:21.510> than<00:03:21.990> what<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.230> had<00:03:22.380> previously

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.830 

alright<00:03:31.500> guys<00:03:31.620> we've<00:03:32.099> finished<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.700> front

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
alright guys we've finished the front

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.880 
alright guys we've finished the front
the<00:03:33.840> spotting<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.170> vehicle<00:03:34.470> around<00:03:34.560> now

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
the spotting the vehicle around now

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.050 
the spotting the vehicle around now
we're<00:03:35.129> going<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> attack<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.670> rear<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
we're going to attack the rear of the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.430 
we're going to attack the rear of the
car<00:03:36.239> we're<00:03:36.900> going<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.110> take<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.349> original

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
car we're going to take the original

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.100 
car we're going to take the original
springs<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.459> out<00:03:38.670> of<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:38.910> vehicle<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.569> put

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
springs back out of this vehicle and put

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:53.360 
springs back out of this vehicle and put
the<00:03:40.230> tough<00:03:40.410> dog<00:03:40.620> 40ml<00:03:41.099> lifted<00:03:41.400> springs<00:03:41.700> in

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.280 

alright<00:03:54.370> guys<00:03:54.490> we've<00:03:54.760> got<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.630> axial

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
alright guys we've got the axial

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.050 
alright guys we've got the axial
supports<00:03:56.740> down<00:03:56.980> knees<00:03:57.250> here<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> reason

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
supports down knees here and the reason

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.000 
supports down knees here and the reason
for<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.480> without<00:03:59.170> going<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> go<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.830> there

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
for that is without going to go in there

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.130 
for that is without going to go in there
and<00:04:00.130> undo<00:04:00.340> these<00:04:00.520> u-bolts<00:04:01.120> once<00:04:01.630> we<00:04:01.780> undo<00:04:02.020> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
and undo these u-bolts once we undo the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.930 
and undo these u-bolts once we undo the
u-bolts<00:04:02.650> obviously<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.160> differential<00:04:03.820> will

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
u-bolts obviously the differential will

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.430 
u-bolts obviously the differential will
come<00:04:04.150> down<00:04:04.390> so<00:04:04.690> we've<00:04:04.810> got<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:04.990> stand<00:04:05.230> here<00:04:05.380> to

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
come down so we've got the stand here to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:13.260 
come down so we've got the stand here to
support<00:04:05.710> that<00:04:05.830> from<00:04:06.100> happening

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.300 

alright<00:04:14.140> guys<00:04:14.230> we've<00:04:14.440> got<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> u-bolts<00:04:15.130> out

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
alright guys we've got the u-bolts out

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.970 
alright guys we've got the u-bolts out
of<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.550> Hilux<00:04:16.420> now<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:16.960> we're<00:04:17.830> going<00:04:17.920> to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
of this Hilux now so we're going to

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.010 
of this Hilux now so we're going to
separate<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.580> loose<00:04:19.360> spring<00:04:19.660> from<00:04:19.900> the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
separate the loose spring from the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.260 
separate the loose spring from the
differential<00:04:20.410> just<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.370> careful<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.970> when

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
differential just be careful that when

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
differential just be careful that when
you<00:04:22.360> guys<00:04:22.510> do<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.290> don't<00:04:23.500> actually
