00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.530
 first repair video on my part 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:11.269
 youtube it's about the milieus of 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:16.170
 chronic b 41 46 porto test system 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.800
 showed me in the display the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.439
 Faulty water drainage very easy too 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.269
 explain water drain water comes in 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.509
 The machine water must be out of the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.480
 machine be rinsed out again 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.350
 mistake is easy to explain 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 he first opens the top cover 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.780
 that makes it easy or 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.420
 After all, washing machines will look 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.489
 side has a blind cap on it is 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.280
 easy to solve small screwdriver 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.059
 There is a thorax size 20 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.519
 he just screws that out 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.129
 yes on both sides logically then 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.300
 Can you just cover the top 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.759
 stand backwards 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.520
 easy nothing is also great 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.060
 hooked somewhere is only 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.509
 two plastic hooks on the back of the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.090
 everyone gets that is no problem 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 then you unscrew the screws on the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:28.860
 back to the 20 if simple 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.200
 you did that, you get that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.399
 Cover easily deducted 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.860
 there are two screws in front there you have to 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.020
 of course I have it myself 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.469
 simple but I have the metal something 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.759
 bent away which does not take any harm 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:51.719
 the washing machine and then you could 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.100
 The cover can be easily removed 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:02:00.289
 at the interior of this washing machine 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:04.490
 The fault is due to the pump itself 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:08.840
 the trend is tor at la the front 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.840
 can only be moved once 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.840
 when he went hard to turn 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.920
 everything is alright then ethically is mile and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 you do not need to worry anymore 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.720
 to make points 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 besides that would actually only need 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.030
 these hoses there is the whole 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.060
 secret these hoses that is the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.060
 thick hose to take her once from 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.489
 It's also easy to do with the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.530
 pliers from its connection source 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.550
 pull it off 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.590
 as you take this hose here 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.400
 on the side of the top leads to that 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.730
 You can easily do that as well 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.730
 pull it off 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.350
 easy to explain 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.680
 all at once by just play 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.000
 you also pull a few siphons 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.780
 take off and clean 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.250
 you do not need to unscrew that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.110
 there you do not need to do any effort 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.160
 I would not unscrew and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.870
 Approach, the drum is leaking 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.190
 seawater in your washroom as needed 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.930
 the big secret is this one 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.340
 white box hands which solves can 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.290
 Loosen by two screws on the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.850
 back wall there I am unfortunately not 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:41.700
 so good to show us but it is 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:45.030
 yes relatively easy to screw two and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.750
 You can pull it off the bucket 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.570
 flush 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 yes that was it all again 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.230
 stuck together 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.380
 look everything is tight again 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:03.390
 do not forget quickly 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.459
 then look at everything 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.780
 is tight 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.950
 I think like I did that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.660
 a pruning in and then running 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.290
 that's me it was already 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.650
 and thus 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.930
 you have saved a good 200 euros you like 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.259
 Hardly believe it's a mess in the tub 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.729
 What a pity Miele brings 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.669
 machine already to stand 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.840
 but it only gets after 5000 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.229
 Hours of operation of our washing machine 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.120
 now it had been necessary since you have to 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:41.169
 Of course you can also do a cleaner 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.190
 Buy over rent to get what you want 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:48.160
 should also do after a certain time 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.960
 and then that also runs on less tip 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.099
 the edge 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.560
 I do not know with which 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:57.099
 Wash detergent while washing 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:02.830
 We should be liquid with the medium 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:05.650
 You can only get this job 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.789
 for liquid detergent needs for 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.949
 powder does not need this use if 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.690
 you should then use powder 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.840
 you remove this use again 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.479
 otherwise the detergent is not right 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.990
 can be washed away and yours 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.360
 to put back hoses 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.710
 I hope that brings something I have 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.710
 unfortunately no video found 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.240
 and have fun repairing
