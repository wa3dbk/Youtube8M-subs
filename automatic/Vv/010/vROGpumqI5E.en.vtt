00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.410
 and put the reel puts cap by 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.280
 cart does not go jumping around let's go there 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 very important 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.960
 cut the little dino looks at the grandmother squeeze and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 Look, this one is easy to forget in 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.640
 so let's start with it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.379
 I put it here 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.309
 sure to support the margin if you 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.309
 so he will leave 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.910
 passes under the high and now has a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 Well, go away by the wedding after 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.540
 that we spent in this rosella of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 companies here if by chance he had 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.290
 in his way because he is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.719
 hidden in here 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.320
 taking advantage of it but can find 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320
 again 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.590
 and here is very well hidden in one more 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.970
 site and now remember the threader 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.729
 came to play as our machine has 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.860
 a protection of animals cause of people 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.080
 You need a donkey from me to help. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.190
 put us first we'll use 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.070
 this goal of the line and because it is low 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.550
 I raise needle here for the flour 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.759
 the needle has raised the foot of the 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.710
 bring the people down to talk 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.030
 You have to get back in here. 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.640
 has a lever 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.670
 in her we raise our foot and below the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.220
 kills to pass the line he is 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 lower the ball down 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.950
 make goal line we'll put here 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 to you will see there 's a hole here looks 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.350
 I pick up the line and put it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.090
 here in the right hole this little 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.080
 line dowel has to pass through the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.060
 needle hole there 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.790
 so it is very important for the machine 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.709
 t is at the bottom that we can 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.739
 have a larger work area and get 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.400
 to the best where the line passes 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.370
 this correct position of last dad 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.860
 fry tooth inserted into a needle hole 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.560
 and went out of here 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.560
 take my line passes the cast 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.680
 Ready, you 're giving the line. 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.180
 I held it and now it's like magic. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.860
 we pull the line also ready to 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.900
 around here on the island 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.420
 now comes another major low award 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.750
 of the canteen box 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:14.540
 we took the line by putting it in. 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.650
 here in important detail do not see that 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.780
 has tooth 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 we want to pass this recent line 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.280
 take it out 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.530
 now the great trick we pull this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.380
 line that we have to fish for 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.840
 needle and look what happens we go 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.569
 lowering that right hand safe people 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 line and lowering the needle 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.290
 Look, the red line is throwing the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.269
 white line gave things seals 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.040
 different for you to see the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.660
 What is going on in here? 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.400
 the red line is fishing the line 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.720
 White are seeing how cool. 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.060
 and look what I do now I pull and look 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.840

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.920
 in the white line rail pick up point of the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.040
 scissors and lift the machine veil is 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.350
