00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:28.100
 lemon mustard and honey 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.510

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.510

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 fold them 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.410
 and go chopping them filleting more 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.410
 for transfers 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.740
 since we finished 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.380
 we put them on a plate 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.360
 first they have to disinfect the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 corner because they always have a lot 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.750
 land 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.480
 then strawberry 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 Y 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.450
 we are going to stir that it is clear that what 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.590
 good thing about this salad is that it can be 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:21.220
 with the fruit of the season as with 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.130
 mandarin orange this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.420
 who else sees the grape 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.420
 or is one of those forces 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.900
 the function that I'm giving him here but 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.739
 I like the one I like the most 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.739
 with tweezers 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.650
 I must take some fruits 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.049
 gross 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.200
 and they are not leaving mooy community 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.430
 since we have the salad 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.000
 I stir it a little more 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.720
 since we have it there 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.520
 and we will do in the devesa 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.710
 to make the fire that's going to be honey 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.900
 mustard 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:53.250

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.260
 to our 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.260

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.190

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.620
 we take a spoonful 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.430
 in case you do not want to do the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.180
 dressing they see it in black 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.750
 ok they already sell it as a living room 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.780
 now they sell it anyway it says seasoning 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.840

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.560
