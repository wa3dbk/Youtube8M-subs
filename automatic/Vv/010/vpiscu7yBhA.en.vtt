00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
Android and you know what I would switch

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.580 
Android and you know what I would switch
just<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.600> any<00:02:34.959> way<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.380> relevant

just for this any way to the relevant
news<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.550> looks<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.790> google<00:02:37.060> has

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
news of now it looks like google has

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.940 
news of now it looks like google has
patented<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.870> system<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> automatically

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
disable the glasses if like let's say a

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.110

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
makes sense but at the same time now

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.050 
makes sense but at the same time now
many<00:02:44.590> people<00:02:44.650> steal<00:02:45.130> glasses<00:02:45.610> off<00:02:45.820> other

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
many people steal glasses off other

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.479 
many people steal glasses off other
people's<00:02:46.480> faces<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:47.380> also<00:02:47.650> this<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.250> probably

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
people's faces but also this is probably

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.699 
people's faces but also this is probably
an<00:02:48.820> expensive<00:02:49.300> piece<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.570> technology<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
an expensive piece of technology so the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.080 
an expensive piece of technology so the
safer<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> better<00:02:51.160> also<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.790> give<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.030> a
