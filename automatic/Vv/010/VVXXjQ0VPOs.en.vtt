00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.030 

well<00:01:47.760> these<00:01:48.760> things<00:01:49.030> can<00:01:49.270> happen<00:01:49.770> cost<00:01:50.770> him<00:01:50.920> a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
well these things can happen cost him a

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.700 
well these things can happen cost him a
run<00:01:51.190> not<00:01:51.909> too<00:01:52.060> much

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
run not too much

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.380 
run not too much
well<00:01:53.710> that's<00:01:53.950> that's<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.700> little<00:01:54.820> unlucky<00:01:55.300> and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
well that's that's a little unlucky and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.790 
well that's that's a little unlucky and
I<00:01:55.479> think<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.810> batsmen<00:01:56.140> should<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.470> run<00:01:56.619> for

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
I think that batsmen should have run for

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.040 
I think that batsmen should have run for
it<00:01:56.890> because<00:01:57.130> Sachin<00:01:57.430> Doshi<00:01:57.550> had<00:01:57.790> covered<00:01:58.240> the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
it because Sachin Doshi had covered the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.410 
it because Sachin Doshi had covered the
ball<00:01:59.229> it<00:01:59.440> clearly<00:01:59.800> hit<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.550> non<00:02:00.700> striker<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
ball it clearly hit the non striker and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.260 
ball it clearly hit the non striker and
and<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:02.860> deflected<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> wall<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:03.850> think<00:02:03.940> in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and he deflected the wall so I think in

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.850 
and he deflected the wall so I think in
the<00:02:04.660> spirit<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.259> game<00:02:05.380> he<00:02:05.500> should<00:02:05.530> have

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
the spirit of the game he should have

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.410 
the spirit of the game he should have
run<00:02:05.979> for<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:07.920> short<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.190> get<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.240> treatment

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
run for it short and get the treatment

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.020 
run for it short and get the treatment
that<00:02:10.720> deserves

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.040 

pulled<00:02:16.030> away<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.630> deep<00:02:16.810> midwicket

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
pulled away to the deep midwicket

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.620 
pulled away to the deep midwicket
boundary<00:02:18.010> before<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.730> as<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.600> a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
boundary before but I as here this is a

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.130 
boundary before but I as here this is a
point<00:02:19.960> I'd<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.230> make<00:02:20.350> here<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
point I'd like to make here in the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.300 
point I'd like to make here in the
earlier<00:02:23.470> delivery<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.700> they<00:02:24.880> had<00:02:25.030> not<00:02:25.210> drawn

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
earlier delivery if they had not drawn

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.590 
earlier delivery if they had not drawn
to<00:02:27.310> non-striker<00:02:27.820> would<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.240> been<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.480> strike

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
to non-striker would have been on strike

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.960 
to non-striker would have been on strike
Bashar<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.260> have<00:02:29.350> been<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.620> strike<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.130> it's

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
Bashar would have been on strike so it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.540 
Bashar would have been on strike so it's
a<00:02:31.090> little<00:02:31.330> unfair<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:32.100> this<00:02:33.100> ball<00:02:33.370> has<00:02:33.520> been

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
a little unfair that this ball has been

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.290 
a little unfair that this ball has been
hit<00:02:33.700> before<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:36.060> deflected<00:02:37.060> off

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
hit before because it it deflected off

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.600 
hit before because it it deflected off
the<00:02:37.480> non<00:02:37.630> strike<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.170> they<00:02:38.290> ran<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:39.370> that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the non strike and they ran is that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
the non strike and they ran is that
sunny<00:02:39.910> Singh<00:02:40.210> as<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.480> go<00:02:40.570> that's<00:02:40.780> one<00:02:40.990> reverse

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
sunny Singh as you go that's one reverse

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
sunny Singh as you go that's one reverse
one<00:02:41.830> growl<00:02:42.130> hope<00:02:42.730> he<00:02:42.880> hasn't<00:02:43.060> hurt<00:02:43.390> himself

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
one growl hope he hasn't hurt himself

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.870 
one growl hope he hasn't hurt himself
too<00:02:44.590> much<00:02:44.800> now<00:02:45.280> it's<00:02:45.460> got<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.970> our<00:02:46.090> ideas

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
too much now it's got that of our ideas
