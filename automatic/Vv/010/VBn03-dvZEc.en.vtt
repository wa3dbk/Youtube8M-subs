00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.060
 an encounter that definitely demanded the charrúas in depth and that 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.210
 possibly prepare them better for the hardness of the quarterfinals 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.080
 with our colleagues to mandela square to tell us what lessons 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.020
 learned from wade ciro procuna russian brailovsky david faitelson forward 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.529
 Hello, we are happy to analyze this first meeting of the round of 16 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.429
 in the company of David and the Russian 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.609
 percent the Uruguayan team in effect from mexico 70 did not win a game of 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.899
 second round on that occasion was from the Aztec stadium and they won 1 to 0 in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.969
 additional time to the Soviet Union with a goal scored by víctor espárrago 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.789
 that was on June 14, 1970, imagine how much time to celebrate 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.360
 another victory 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 direct mention 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.320
 I want you to explain me certainly garowe with a goal by diego forlán 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.470
 but what happened to uruguay desbarre councilors of um 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.410
 20 25 and mario suárez from the bars if there was a past played gates 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.820
 whom I wanted to raise attentive but we're here but let's see if 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.750
 please explain what happened to uruguay from minute 20 25 to 70 'enke him 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.050
 gave the initiative to the South Korean team 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.020
 percent 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 first there is that I decided to make clear with a much better gualicho in the first 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.280
 much better time in korea 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.620
 when he makes the Uruguayan goal it's like they say 'good now that they do not come to 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 attacking we give spaces to Uruguayans are very fast and very good 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 against punchers they were wrong and they were wrong ugly because from there in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.840
 forward until it came the goal of Korea's draw was all of Korea and what 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.410
 handled well and had the ball that came this by eva longoria I do not know what 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.820
 they relocate novara just places are deconcentrated when they have to topped 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.170
 a ball suddenly hits him there is no way out there that mischief of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.220
 South American are still the entities still very innocent 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.009
 and the goal of the corianos comes 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.549
 and at that time lita b bosé party was shown sure is cast they are 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.069
 tired both golf and Uruguay will be returned to the front and start 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.979
 to play or amen to run street art better I think it's a good 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.459
 change the teacher tabares putting lodeiro to grab the ball a lot 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.759
 more than half of the field to join the world by forlán and leave it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.040
 more loose of the cta Suarez and cavani that helped him go to him before 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.459
 because we give a tendency of this type and that it does well that you see and that you mark 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.060
 their behavior and understand it but very rich or clear they are winning thrown 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.900
 back and when we visit win vamo for the tabby reserves the zero 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.300
 and instead of looking for the second so much affection of the slap is the first 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:29.930
 give them the cup 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.000
 the world to react should be a little more balanced rude returned to 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.090
 show something there is when you try to react h like that wounded boxer 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
 reacts decide to fight hogan the game now strikes me 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.270
 that the first two goals of this game 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.420
 are still errors the goalkeepers submitted the goalie overcome has 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.010
 what to see in that center that goes from side to side clarified and then muslera 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.320
 has to do in the exit of the goal with which his colleague tied the first 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.969
 Coriano has to anticipate play did not comment new account and the second 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.240
 how do you get there 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.250
 and without paying the value josek hits because the one that is being neither top of the ball and 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.709
 of that I adore you in Lugano then 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.539
 very logical the position that if you go to a man with the defense or with the 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.059
 forward I did not have to leave if I had held the head but suddenly it will 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.179
 now there are many people the sun all Mexican public 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.179
 some countries also because I will eat face Uruguay 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.789
 that unfairly catalog Uruguayan soccer p 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.219
 the less defensive thing they say defensive they say consistent the 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.709
 conservative skiing do not use another word harder task more and more 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.260
 vulgar I do not think that Uruguay is what they say but that it is their last and I think 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.240
 that is a sample of what can be 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.659
 holding its potential for 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.309
 if you have the first look for the second one they backed out or satins 3 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.219
 great attackers as a starter is the reality of what it is and ends up being 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.229
 of this game duboef huelva loose everything we have seen him and 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.980
 I asked to fail to uruguay tello day 1 1 I think very clear about 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.479
 right sector 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.529
 to record at the time of arrival of the habano safarova that the Uruguayan of 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:05.479
 Gregorian navarrete now seems to evaporate if he looks at it the first time 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.569
 that uruguay had the obligation to feel favorite to feel me why 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.640
 with south africa with france and mexico 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.440
 maybe 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.930
 well commented had advantage not in the table 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.450
 in the group table but now it felt like a favorite uruguay likewise 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.750
 do not underestimate Uruguay you had to do to win today for today 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.490
 eighths to the mind you have to pass you do not have to grab and play in a way 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.860
 lyrical and like the public and housewives what you have to do on the court 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.810
 they did it 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.740
 It seems to me that his future is not the best news for Uruguayans now that his 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.520
 goalscorer is in good rhythm the goals scored two goals 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.260
 after he scored 49 in this football year for it yesterday he found out the 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.580
 television the cup and in europe lic we return with you 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.870
 thank you very much companions may be that the day is short but moss and very 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.059
 meaty if you want something later with the analysis 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.779
 from South Africa in this World Cup sportscenter edition
