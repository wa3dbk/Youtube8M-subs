00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.640
 Good evening from the kitchen evolved today 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.890
 we will prepare homemade tagging ve 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.780
 we propose the variant with a view 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.870
 as for the equipment there 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.090
 you need a coffee grinder or a mixer 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.760
 a blender provided it is very powerful 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.160
 as for the ingredients there 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.500
 we need the sesame seeds that can 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.120
 be both blond and dark like 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.600
 prefer 70 grams to fill a 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.149
 jar of about 200 milliliters of 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 taking remember that the seeds go 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.000
 rehydrated rinsed dried before 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.230
 pulverize them or you can 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 pulverize them and then soak them 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.389
 always throwing away the water is already 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.219
 when in this way you will avoid the 

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:09.490
 drying step in 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.990
 dryer do as you like best 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.509
 two tablespoons of sesame seed oil 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.149
 cold pressed well stay with 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.179
 the oil taken from the same seed that 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:23.450
 we use to make 100 milliliters time 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.350
 of water we grind the seeds until they are reduced 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.450
 in flour 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.749
 now that we have pulverized and reduced it 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.779
 then in flour we can very well e 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:34.909
 start to whip the flour 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:36.439
 in the blender we add the two 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.770
 tablespoons of sesame seed oil 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.409
 then we combine the 100 milliliters of water 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.649
 and whisk away with a spatula 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.400
 we clean the walls of the blender so 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:57.310
 such that all seeds 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:00.850
 are smoothies here is the tie in 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.340
 clear it's ready now we are brocchi for the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.710
 presentation of the homemade tie 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.350
 just like we did without it 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.040
 use the mortar you would have requested 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.160
 an excessively long process is 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.530
 decidedly more free-range than that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.739
 that maybe you can buy companies 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.319
 specialists who work the seeds up to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.510
 then let the oil come out naturally 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.780
 without adding it as we did 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.390
 to speed up work with the tie-in 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.030
 we can dress numerous sauces 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.410
 obviously a seasoning that goes 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.380
 accompanied to other 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.160
 we can prepare some excellent fumus 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.260
 of peas or other legumes good a 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.480
 this point we salute you good food 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.930
 donated to all and to the next video 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.930
