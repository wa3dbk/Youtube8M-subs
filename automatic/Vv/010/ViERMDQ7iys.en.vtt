00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello welcome to the tips section 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.920
 hobby bike mechanics today I'm going to 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 talk about a subject that they ask us 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.050
 we have habitually played many themes 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 of frame 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.119
 and we get good questions because the 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.210
 people have problems have movements 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.680
 and explain what problems we can 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.310
 find in this case that we have a 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.730
 sports bike series are currently 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.220
 very economical and many people can 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.670
 access them and you find that of 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.250
 how good are certain rebounds or 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.520
 certain poses on the bike that do not 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.740
 they should exist 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.540
 the first possible approach is 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.370
 change the suspensions instead the 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.100
 suspensions then good bet with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.989
 scale suspensions then we're going to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 treat the front and back issues 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.500
 most interesting things that can be done 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 economic way 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.550
 the first problem is the problem that you 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.020
 can come to buy a motorcycle of that is 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.850
 the maintenance of this kind of 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.229
 motorcycles and we have here 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.350
 fork maintenance expedition 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.000
 null people do not do maintenance 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.640
 everything and that the manual marks because 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.979
 We use oils inside the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 fork space interior fork 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.180
 Well oil is the oil 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.710
 hydraulic which will slow down all the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.439
 strength of the dock because if not a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 system only with spring the problem is 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.909
 that bounces does not bounce because the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 spring is a oscillating machine 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.179
 let's hope for oxidation and it seems 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.690
 that the oil makes expire 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.850
 we do not have expiration then 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.530
 bad oil management or even a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.470
 low oil level can cause 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.310
 problems on a sports bike the apothecary 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 sporting what we can not find is 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.440
 that the beard oil has already 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.990
 diminished 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.970
 then the decrease of the camera 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.730
 air the air chamber that is the camera 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.020
 inside because 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.280
 simple if I have this dimension here 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.610
 we have the amount of oil in the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 amount of air 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.910
 because because this has to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.850
 enter here inside this is 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.259
 enter this camera is reduced but 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.580
 we have to leave a sufficient camera 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.640
 because if I filled this much with 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.410
 oil this we would not enter no 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.710
 we would get to lock the fork not 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.810
 the inner vacuum can be introduced 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.860
 It gives a certain internal pressure that you 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 It makes docks and this diminishes me 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.800
 a lot what diminishes me above all is 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 the brake at the last point and that we 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.510
 we can find that in some 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.599
 motorcycles a little simple 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.599
 tends to the top of the top 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 it is a 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.590
 a maintenance of this bar 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.750
 with a suitable camera level marked 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.920
 by manufacturer that would change the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.260
 new agent oil 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.930
 we look what we would change it would remove the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.930
 effect of the top the most important effect 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.910
 not from the top of the stop because if a motorbike 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.849
 more more economical in this we can 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.209
 sports then the rebound then 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.209
 bounces a lot 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.760
 the idea is that the oil that has the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.250
 absorb function does not absorb a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.830
 person why the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.870
 system is like a dock but still 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.850
 very from the dock very wearing it stretches 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.020
 since another one oscillates it leaves it thus and what 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.810
 It makes a swing which end is 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.070
 for but it oscillates because that becomes 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.800
 in a continuous movement in the case of 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.290
 a pothole work a very strong braking 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.570
 can give you a lot of rebound from 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.720
 here people are considering change not 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.030
 Bounces of bounces change of change 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.750
 oil it is possible that everything is solved 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 this all this front failure can be 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.080
 see increased a slight glide back 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.019
 but why good back motive carry 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.810
 gas and gas it stabilizes the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.519
 3 rear gas cushion is lost 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.620
 eventually, you're losing and the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.000
 pressurized gas is a spring of yes I 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.459
 I lose the gas and the dock and dam that 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.519
 my pier that was very soft to stay 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.110
 very soft the bike low back 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.959
 then it tends to go down a bit behind 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:20.410
 and to plan in fast corners 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.509
 in this case it has those factors that you 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.580
 they hurt a lot we are one is the plan 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.310
 same plan and second is the change of 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.410
 geometry because going down from behind is 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.080
 part makes this part higher 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.229
 is the motor skills tend to lose very 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.699
 fast the front train and you are 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.800
 than a motorcycle that you bought 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.410
 sporty since you open gas and quickly 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
 he wants to take you out does not worry about 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.220
 this and you open gas and he wants to throw you out 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.790
 and we say plan is worth not always not 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.310
 forever 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.880
 and the preload mind can help you 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.190
 if we charge you, believe that we do not harden 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.830
 a spring growth then the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.660
 recharge in this case would be a good 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.380
 option although we would not solve the 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.380
 front bounce 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.190
 summarizing is simple no 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.660
 also oil management bars 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.900
 air chamber in the case of motorcycle 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.479
 Portugal 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.360
 and the back world would be based a bit on 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.340
 what would be the preload systems and 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.560
 if we know any place to do 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.680
 suspensions possibly a recharge 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.650
 of the rear shock absorber in this case 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.300
 we will recover the very hardness of backside and 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.210
 we would recover 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.780
 the firmness is no longer hardness is firmness or 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.610
 support of the front tire that we 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.060
 I would do much more security of this 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.159
 form our purchase of motorcycle that has been 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.710
 cheap is not going to increase either 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.629
 then at a much higher expense so that 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.949
 it can circulate with it here the 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.129
 program today and up to the week that 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.129
 comes
