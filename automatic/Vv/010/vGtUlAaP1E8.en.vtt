 as it has been called as you choose 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.970
 dish in story because you get to 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.560
 Ministry at the time you are cited 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.990
 there is already a security guard is made 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.550
 happen you're there with everyone that 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.320
 You already know and they are calling 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.850
 name by the order you have go 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.800
 calling the names the parents we go 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.410
 towards a good door I was for all 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.630
 I include the odd ones they fan towards another 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.790
 You pass by a table give your ID and they give you 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.560
 as an identification sticker the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.210
 credential and then we're going in 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 a very large room we are sitting 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.729
 setting all down after the numbers 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.470
 bigger up and there's here like a 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.820
 round table with a few computers 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.610
 people and they are also calling you 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.740
 numbers again basing your data says 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.350
 where do you want to go and finally finally 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.180
 They give the entity the same to the famous entity and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.180
 it's done is done 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.340
 and it has been the hardest part of this 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.650
 preparation because the hardest thing can not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 leave this late studying 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.240
 and good and every plan that I have 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.100
 You can say that it is not only 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.110
 pending of the book uff 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.280
 I think that mentally reading is very hard 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 you have to be very clear about what 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.990
 you want because if it does not beat you it's a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.340
 obstacle course constantly 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.540
 then you have to be very clear what 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 what do you want to move forward if so 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.470
 a nine months a very hard year and I read the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 stand cerrato the day 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.269
 what has helped the most 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.010
 academy in doing this preparation myself 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.900
 I think they gave you apart you have to 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.670
 study one but they gave you everything one more 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.950
 here and I want to refer the books of no 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.260
 I know what now I do not know how much will a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.220
 ultra summary of I do not know what they were 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.410
 more organizations imagine if I go 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 to 1,011 self-evaluations and all 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.560
 exams that you could do because then 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.750
 Apart from studying I trained you a lot 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.610
 more asking questions then I think 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.489
 that has been the most important thing I 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.230
 I think especially good my tutor who 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.030
 it helped me a lot 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.950
 the simulations do all the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 simulations and correct them well and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.709
 teachers in class because they are very very 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.690
 good teachers 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.069
 the cto method or they endow you with a 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.200
 method because I prepared myself once for 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.090
 my own and pass it so bad 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.489
 this time with an organization and the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.319
 super good materials because I've 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.799
 felt a lot better studying 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.260
 I did not have that feeling of overwhelm and 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.250
 fatality so that and the simulacra 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.069
 the video class electro macaron and I do not know 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.690
 everything the whole method is great to me the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.299
 planning they served a lot because I 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.579
 they marked the era as small goals 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.840
 week to week then neither do you 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.000
 you were giving an account of what you were going 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.390
 doing until the end that you already had 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.160
 I make you a teacher who has 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.290
 liked that you remember the course 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.730
 to maite vallés of geriatrics that takes it 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.310
 A lot of love I thought a professional 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.620
 very very good for me the teacher the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.200
 foundation in milk is that it is 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.850
 foundation in day 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.490
 and she many times exceeds less 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.130
 we want to take a together with hadi this 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.680
 almost with maite it's wonderful to remember 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.300
 of the exam that is what has most 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.930
 helped that the day of the exam 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.480
 You said this I have already done it when 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.250
 I went out and left fatally bad mood 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.780
 crying and I remembered that javi not 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.880
 I had said that was very good 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.440
 feeling that it was that I had made a 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.950
 good exam and the truth is that I remembered 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.350
 a lot of nice at that time imagine 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.360
 that I am a nurse that I love 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.380
 lend that comes but I'm very afraid 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.140
 because everyone tells me that it has been 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.880
 very hard in this preparation as 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.550
 I would advise stucco as I would encourage 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.500
 that you introduce me and the first thing that does not 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.910
 is afraid of nothing because if you do not know if 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.740
 you do not know you can not have fear 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.050
 then if you have experience it's worth it but 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.300
 just work hard every day 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.520
 and progressively increasing hours of 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.290
 studies and little by little you will get 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.889
 everything is achieved and with the help of both 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.810
 academy 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.810
 tutors teachers get everything
