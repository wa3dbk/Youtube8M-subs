is designed from the shape of the skull

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.789 
is designed from the shape of the skull
itself<00:00:12.250> in<00:00:13.059> order<00:00:13.510> to<00:00:13.780> avoid<00:00:14.049> pressure<00:00:14.440> on

five<00:00:15.160> areas<00:00:15.639> which<00:00:16.330> consistently<00:00:16.990> cause

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
five areas which consistently cause

five areas which consistently cause
discomfort<00:00:17.920> with<00:00:18.280> traditional<00:00:18.850> head<00:00:19.030> wear

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
discomfort with traditional head wear

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.570 
discomfort with traditional head wear
firstly<00:00:22.140> discomfort<00:00:23.140> on<00:00:23.260> the<00:00:23.410> pole<00:00:23.620> with<00:00:23.980> all

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
firstly discomfort on the pole with all

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.760 
firstly discomfort on the pole with all
the<00:00:24.730> weight<00:00:24.910> going<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.540> one<00:00:25.750> narrow<00:00:26.140> nose<00:00:26.530> band

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
the weight going on one narrow nose band

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.330 
the weight going on one narrow nose band
strap<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:28.720> is<00:00:28.780> why<00:00:29.080> we<00:00:29.290> have<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.500> widened<00:00:30.100> and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
strap this is why we have a widened and

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.580 
strap this is why we have a widened and
padded<00:00:30.730> headpiece<00:00:31.180> with<00:00:31.900> no<00:00:32.079> separate

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.970 

secondly<00:00:38.270> when<00:00:39.170> looking<00:00:39.440> at<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.649> skull<00:00:39.950> of

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
secondly when looking at the skull of

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.910 
secondly when looking at the skull of
any<00:00:40.280> horse<00:00:40.579> it<00:00:41.180> is<00:00:41.480> obvious<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.410> top<00:00:42.620> jaw

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
any horse it is obvious that the top jaw

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.130 
any horse it is obvious that the top jaw
is<00:00:43.250> considerably<00:00:44.000> wider<00:00:44.270> than<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.720> lower<00:00:44.870> jaw

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
is considerably wider than the lower jaw

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.730 
is considerably wider than the lower jaw
and<00:00:45.470> therefore<00:00:46.340> protrudes

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.380 

this<00:00:50.740> means<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:51.190> tight<00:00:51.610> cranked<00:00:52.270> up

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
this means that tight cranked up

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.720 
this means that tight cranked up
cavesson<00:00:52.900> nose<00:00:53.110> bands<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.740> traditional

cavesson nose bands and traditional
lands<00:00:54.940> cabins<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:56.260> cause<00:00:56.530> huge<00:00:56.950> discomfort

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
lands cabins can cause huge discomfort

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.670 
lands cabins can cause huge discomfort
and<00:00:57.790> damage<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.900> sensitive<00:00:59.380> tissue

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
and damage to the sensitive tissue

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.340 
and damage to the sensitive tissue
inside<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.430> mouth<00:01:00.610> as<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.720> tissue<00:01:01.960> becomes

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
inside the mouth as this tissue becomes

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.770 
inside the mouth as this tissue becomes
sandwiched<00:01:03.070> between<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.940> outer<00:01:04.120> edge<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.660> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
sandwiched between the outer edge of the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.380

band<00:01:07.660> pressing<00:01:08.350> inwards<00:01:08.740> on<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.040> other<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
band pressing inwards on the other this

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.340 
band pressing inwards on the other this
is<00:01:12.370> why<00:01:12.640> we<00:01:12.880> have<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.090> drop<00:01:13.450> noseband<00:01:13.690> shape

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
is why we have a drop noseband shape

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.090 
is why we have a drop noseband shape
with<00:01:15.190> unique<00:01:15.550> diagonal<00:01:16.180> side<00:01:16.479> pieces

without any inward pressure thirdly it

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.280 
without any inward pressure thirdly it
is<00:01:24.220> also<00:01:24.520> easy<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:25.090> see<00:01:25.300> how<00:01:25.990> traditional

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.160 
nose which should never be subjected to
the<00:02:22.810> pressure<00:02:23.020> of<00:02:23.230> low<00:02:23.590> fitting<00:02:24.010> nose<00:02:24.220> bands

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the pressure of low fitting nose bands

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.930 
the pressure of low fitting nose bands
this<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.230> why<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:26.770> have<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> front<00:02:27.370> nose<00:02:27.670> piece

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
this is why we have the front nose piece

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.600 
this is why we have the front nose piece
sitting<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.080> nose<00:02:29.290> higher<00:02:29.800> than<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.580> normal

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
sitting on the nose higher than a normal

sitting on the nose higher than a normal
drop<00:02:31.209> noseband<00:02:32.010> finally<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.190> most

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
drop noseband finally and most

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.520 
drop noseband finally and most

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
importantly when looking where the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.980 
importantly when looking where the
tongue<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.010> bit<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.580> fit<00:02:36.819> at<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.599> narrow

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
tongue and bit have to fit at the narrow

tongue and bit have to fit at the narrow
lower<00:02:38.290> jaw<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.610> bars<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.209> mouth

lower jaw and the bars of the mouth

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.170 
lower jaw and the bars of the mouth
which<00:02:41.170> are<00:02:41.349> shaped<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:41.830> knife<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.670> is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
which are shaped like a knife it is

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.900 
which are shaped like a knife it is
obvious<00:02:43.660> why<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.140> many<00:02:44.290> horses

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
obvious why so many horses

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.550 
obvious why so many horses
understandably<00:02:45.910> object<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.900> strong<00:02:47.200> pressure

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
understandably object to strong pressure

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.190 
understandably object to strong pressure
on<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.950> tongue<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.190> bars<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:49.599> is<00:02:49.660> why<00:02:49.990> we

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
on the tongue and bars this is why we

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.170 
on the tongue and bars this is why we
have<00:02:50.410> both<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.890> tongue<00:02:51.130> protection<00:02:51.790> system

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
have both a tongue protection system

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.390 
have both a tongue protection system
that<00:02:52.420> takes<00:02:53.080> any<00:02:53.290> extra<00:02:53.770> pressure<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that takes any extra pressure on the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.230 
that takes any extra pressure on the
nose

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.180 

and<00:02:58.560> that

and that

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.430

options<00:03:00.580> that<00:03:01.240> are<00:03:01.390> truly<00:03:01.600> effective<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
options that are truly effective and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.490 
options that are truly effective and
