00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.370 
true collaboration but you do have to
provide<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.640> environment<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:17.600> that

there

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:38.970 

me

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.750 

that's<00:01:39.980> what<00:01:40.370> really<00:01:40.610> fascinates<00:01:41.090> me

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
that's what really fascinates me

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.100 
that's what really fascinates me
continually<00:01:43.760> is<00:01:44.060> how<00:01:44.240> each<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:44.750> us<00:01:44.870> as

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
continually is how each of us as

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.000 
continually is how each of us as
individuals<00:01:45.140> have<00:01:46.070> this<00:01:46.370> world<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.650> hope

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
individuals have this world and I hope

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.060 
individuals have this world and I hope
to<00:01:49.040> be<00:01:49.220> able<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.480> know<00:01:50.650> not<00:01:51.650> only<00:01:51.680> get<00:01:52.040> a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
to be able to you know not only get a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.250 
to be able to you know not only get a
glimpse<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.180> be<00:01:53.330> able<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.840> manifest

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
glimpse of it but to be able to manifest

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.530 
glimpse of it but to be able to manifest
it<00:01:54.680> with<00:01:54.800> an<00:01:54.980> image<00:01:55.370> so<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.700> other<00:01:56.150> people

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
it with an image so that other people

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.420 
it with an image so that other people
can<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.680> maybe<00:01:57.920> they'll<00:01:58.220> identify

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
can see it and maybe they'll identify

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.790 
can see it and maybe they'll identify
and<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.390> think<00:01:59.660> it<00:01:59.780> makes<00:01:59.990> us<00:02:00.200> all<00:02:00.440> less<00:02:01.400> alone
