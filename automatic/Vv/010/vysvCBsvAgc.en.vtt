a very responsible kid and I mean that's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.810 
a very responsible kid and I mean that's
that's<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.410> main<00:03:33.590> thing<00:03:33.620> it's<00:03:33.980> what<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.250> it's

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
that's the main thing it's what you it's

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.120 
that's the main thing it's what you it's
the<00:03:34.970> habits<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.420> learn<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:36.620> high<00:03:36.710> school<00:03:37.100> that

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the habits you learn in high school that

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.310 
the habits you learn in high school that
really<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.700> difference<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.300> and<00:03:38.600> I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
really are the difference and and I

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.630 
really are the difference and and I
think<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.680> he<00:03:39.800> goes<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.130> further<00:03:40.370> and

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
think as he goes on further and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.040 
think as he goes on further and
