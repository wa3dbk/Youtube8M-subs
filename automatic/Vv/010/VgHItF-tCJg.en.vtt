really tall chunky platform shoes I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.220 
really tall chunky platform shoes I
would<00:02:14.580> not<00:02:14.790> say<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.120> these<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.720> necessarily

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
would not say that these are necessarily

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.070

like<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> good<00:02:16.920> shoe<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.700> beginners<00:02:18.300> they're

like a good shoe for beginners they're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
like a good shoe for beginners they're
definitely<00:02:19.319> more<00:02:19.770> challenging<00:02:20.090> than<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
definitely more challenging than the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.840 
Lita's
but<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.830> they<00:02:22.920> are<00:02:23.040> equally<00:02:23.550> as

but I think that they are equally as

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.750 
but I think that they are equally as
cushy<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> bottom<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> platform<00:02:26.220> so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
cushy in the bottom of the platform so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.940 
cushy in the bottom of the platform so
they're<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.090> comfortable<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:28.080> latest<00:02:28.560> people

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
they're as comfortable as latest people

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
they're as comfortable as latest people

with<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.079> lot<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.320> different<00:03:22.769> accessories

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
with like a lot of different accessories

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.240 
with like a lot of different accessories
I<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.510> these<00:03:24.930> are<00:03:24.989> super<00:03:25.560> easy<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.040> walk<00:03:26.190> in

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I think these are super easy to walk in

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.819 
I think these are super easy to walk in
because<00:03:26.850> they<00:03:27.299> almost<00:03:27.750> feel<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.200> creepers

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
because they almost feel like creepers

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.350 
because they almost feel like creepers
when<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.220> walk<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.610> them<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.000> have

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
when you walk in them they just have

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.220 
when you walk in them they just have
like<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.870> 1<00:03:31.500> inch<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:32.100> 1/2<00:03:32.549> inch<00:03:32.820> flat<00:03:33.390> platform

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
like a 1 inch to 1/2 inch flat platform

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
like a 1 inch to 1/2 inch flat platform
and<00:03:34.680> correct<00:03:35.579> me<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.820> I'm<00:03:35.970> wrong<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.329> feel<00:03:36.510> kind

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and correct me if I'm wrong I feel kind

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.509 
and correct me if I'm wrong I feel kind
of<00:03:36.750> stupid<00:03:36.959> for<00:03:37.290> not<00:03:37.320> knowing<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.489> I

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
of stupid for not knowing this but I

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.900 
of stupid for not knowing this but I
think<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.420> off<00:03:39.690> first<00:03:40.380> was

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
think that the back off first was

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.150 
think that the back off first was
debuted<00:03:41.910> during<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.570> black<00:03:43.200> milk<00:03:43.560> Jeffrey

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
debuted during the black milk Jeffrey

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160 
debuted during the black milk Jeffrey
Campbell<00:03:44.370> collaboration<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.630> think<00:03:46.079> that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
Campbell collaboration I think that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.289 
Campbell collaboration I think that
there<00:03:46.350> were<00:03:46.560> several<00:03:47.280> different<00:03:47.790> prints<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
there were several different prints of

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.650 
there were several different prints of
the<00:03:48.570> back<00:03:49.110> off<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.440> were<00:03:49.920> offered<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:51.360> I

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
the back off that were offered but I

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.690 
the back off that were offered but I
don't<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.959> just<00:03:52.140> feel<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.680> these<00:03:53.160> black

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
don't know I just feel like these black

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.300 
don't know I just feel like these black
and<00:03:54.030> silver<00:03:54.570> combo<00:03:55.110> will<00:03:55.410> be<00:03:55.530> perfect<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.160> my

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.370 
and silver combo will be perfect for my
wardrobe<00:03:56.519> because<00:03:57.360> most<00:03:57.600> of<00:03:57.750> my<00:03:57.870> jewelry<00:03:57.930> is

silver and a lot of my clothing is black
I<00:04:01.140> just<00:04:01.350> thought<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:01.709> would<00:04:01.829> be<00:04:01.920> a

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
I just thought that this would be a

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.599 
I just thought that this would be a
great<00:04:02.430> everyday<00:04:03.230> staple<00:04:04.230> boot<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.400> also

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
great everyday staple boot but it's also

great everyday staple boot but it's also
like<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.150> different<00:04:06.870> kind<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.709> boot<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.310> not

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
like a different kind of boot it's not

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.699 
like a different kind of boot it's not
like<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:09.209> know<00:04:09.329> it's<00:04:09.690> it's<00:04:09.989> not<00:04:10.109> it's<00:04:10.530> not

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
like you know it's it's not it's not

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.099 
like you know it's it's not it's not
common<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.489> looks<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.150> little<00:04:12.390> bit<00:04:12.630> different

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
common it looks a little bit different

a pair of these for the longest time but
I<00:05:44.389> really<00:05:44.719> waited<00:05:45.229> until<00:05:45.530> they<00:05:46.070> got<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.310> color

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
I really waited until they got a color

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.029 
I really waited until they got a color
that<00:05:46.909> I<00:05:46.969> thought<00:05:47.330> would<00:05:47.449> be<00:05:47.599> perfect<00:05:48.289> for<00:05:48.530> my

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
that I thought would be perfect for my

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.459 
that I thought would be perfect for my
wardrobe<00:05:49.520> and<00:05:49.909> a<00:05:50.570> fabric<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.050> I<00:05:51.199> really

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
wardrobe and a fabric that I really

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.379 
wardrobe and a fabric that I really
liked<00:05:51.650> they<00:05:51.860> had<00:05:52.039> a<00:05:52.070> black<00:05:52.430> pair<00:05:52.759> before<00:05:53.120> and

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
liked they had a black pair before and

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.219 
liked they had a black pair before and
it<00:05:53.479> was<00:05:53.599> a<00:05:53.860> black<00:05:54.860> just<00:05:55.639> standard<00:05:56.210> matte<00:05:56.780> black

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
it was a black just standard matte black

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.480 
it was a black just standard matte black
leather<00:05:57.710> but<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.940> ankle<00:05:59.479> strap<00:05:59.930> was<00:06:00.409> gold<00:06:01.070> and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
leather but the ankle strap was gold and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.540 
leather but the ankle strap was gold and
velcro<00:06:01.909> and<00:06:02.570> first<00:06:03.020> of<00:06:03.169> all<00:06:03.259> I<00:06:03.500> just<00:06:03.740> really<00:06:04.250> do

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
velcro and first of all I just really do

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.450 
velcro and first of all I just really do
not<00:06:04.759> like<00:06:04.820> velcro<00:06:05.380> anywhere<00:06:06.380> on<00:06:06.530> my<00:06:06.560> shoes<00:06:07.070> I

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
not like velcro anywhere on my shoes I

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.969 
not like velcro anywhere on my shoes I
think<00:06:07.909> inevitably<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.870> velcro<00:06:09.259> would<00:06:09.740> wear

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
think inevitably the velcro would wear

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.830 
think inevitably the velcro would wear
out<00:06:10.219> I<00:06:10.699> was<00:06:10.909> just<00:06:10.940> hoping<00:06:11.270> that<00:06:11.449> they<00:06:11.690> would

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
out I was just hoping that they would

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.070 
out I was just hoping that they would
make<00:06:12.080> a<00:06:12.320> black<00:06:13.039> pair<00:06:13.520> that<00:06:14.300> would<00:06:14.539> go<00:06:14.840> better

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
make a black pair that would go better

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.040 
make a black pair that would go better
with<00:06:15.800> my<00:06:16.039> wardrobe<00:06:16.310> and<00:06:16.820> would<00:06:17.090> not<00:06:17.330> have<00:06:17.659> the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
with my wardrobe and would not have the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.070 
with my wardrobe and would not have the
velcro<00:06:18.349> ankle<00:06:19.070> thing<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:19.610> along<00:06:20.479> came<00:06:20.780> these

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
velcro ankle thing and along came these

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.910 
velcro ankle thing and along came these
so<00:06:21.770> these<00:06:22.190> are<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.849> crushed<00:06:23.449> velvet<00:06:23.870> version

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
so these are the crushed velvet version

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.200 
so these are the crushed velvet version
and<00:06:25.010> I'm<00:06:25.100> thinking<00:06:25.400> that<00:06:25.550> this<00:06:25.700> type<00:06:25.940> is

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
and I'm thinking that this type is

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.930 
and I'm thinking that this type is
exclusive<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.260> website<00:06:27.950> that<00:06:27.980> I<00:06:28.460> got<00:06:28.700> them

eventually if you have patience I'm not

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.060 
eventually if you have patience I'm not
sure<00:06:58.760> if<00:06:58.880> it's<00:06:59.030> just<00:06:59.360> me<00:06:59.570> but<00:06:59.990> wedges<00:07:00.680> and

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
sure if it's just me but wedges and

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.970 
sure if it's just me but wedges and
really<00:07:01.940> high<00:07:02.210> flats<00:07:02.810> are<00:07:03.230> the<00:07:03.740> most

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
really high flats are the most

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.190 
really high flats are the most
challenging<00:07:04.130> for<00:07:04.760> me<00:07:05.000> to<00:07:05.180> walk<00:07:05.390> in<00:07:05.660> so<00:07:06.170> I

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
challenging for me to walk in so I

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.810 
challenging for me to walk in so I
definitely<00:07:06.560> wouldn't<00:07:06.980> recommend<00:07:07.310> these<00:07:07.610> like

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
definitely wouldn't recommend these like

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.520

if you live somewhere where there's like

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.580
