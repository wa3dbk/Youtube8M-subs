00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 Hello again everyone again today again 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.380
 glands from base 5 they need to be restored 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.559
 on a piece of iron is not my today is today 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 a piece of iron of my good friend Andrei 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.880
 professional of his craft, and he say 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.490
 that the former special forces does not happen but here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
 in general, he is now retired his 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.189
 equipment shop here 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.579
 today he asked me to catch him 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.950
 just knives tidy up here I still 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.930
 not doing well in general here we 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 today is the standard set of american 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 marine regular 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:55.890
 I do not know already in hell at what time presidio 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 auto 5 broken off by the tip there you are 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.829
 Che damn well it's easy getting it all 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.850
 by the way on this bunch of mandy 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.920
 here on it here so here marking 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 here is this icon for some reason I did not 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.950
 I noticed I understand that this is well I 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 I don `t know that it is morovich someone to me 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.900
 will prompt the number nsn it means about 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 That this knife has passed a series of tests 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:28.729
 approved for use by NATO troops here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 such a thing 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.369
 these 2 numbers are like that but he has something 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.490
 the color of the handle can not lower as bud 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.470
 either purple the rising than you on 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.119
 it is not so visible on this much visible 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.270
 that he is just another color 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.009
 this is even more characteristic but apparently 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 when it was tanto and you tried 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.750
 drag and very neat well 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.750
 we have what we have 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.740
 so here it is such a cool 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.280
 baby of good fortune too 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.790
 Serreytor like the American military 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.500
 Many ask why I do not know 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.030
 why probably because this thing 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.489
 convenient to pick something 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 Well it is mediocre although not on 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.349
 actually properly sharpened tanto 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:31.549
 cuts very well but probably this is for 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:35.630
 some of these know such heavy tasks 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:40.810
 where you can cut hard materials either 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.810
 something else then such a thing 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.410
 another man wave laser 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 tools did not seem to use 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:59.510
 as usual having made friends 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:00.579
 file but more here everything is in 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.870
 okay 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:08.140
 even here in the oil is still so likely this 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.170
 I will keep the thing too 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.489
 it hurts I like her so much 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.720
 we put here here then very characteristic 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 thing for the American base here is such 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:31.359
 knife is such a victorinox knife 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.359
 with lock 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.250
 with a saw model unfortunately I remember how 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.140
 called but nevertheless it is very 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.840
 typical for you very nice here 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:56.550
 such a thing 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.550
 kershaw leek with composite blade 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.400
 mean on top of us sendrik 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.120
 some kind of ordinary a on the lower steppe 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.370
 md2 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:18.690
 powder bonded copper alloys 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:22.810
 little leaks petty petting and here a 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.480

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.600
 I try to take Andrew himself at a good 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.560
 price for customization of the summer, I think 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.990
 the coolest option 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.990
 insta that he has broken this lock 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:47.080
 This new lock is very easy. 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:50.169
 student here 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.030
 glued plastinochka which will 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:59.260
 like that 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:03.600
 thing is also not typical for the base 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:12.000
 but nevertheless, one more such here 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:18.520
 fig only sour cream knife with such 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:27.100

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.410

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.120
 work out or not, but I would like to 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:47.760
 if you can have your face with something 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.760
 come up with custom horse style 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:57.880
 from base restored wonderful 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.460
 microtek is still sleepy ring tip 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.639
 but I will not be restored in this 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.639
 I doubt
