we<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> do<00:00:04.620> an<00:00:04.710> incline<00:00:05.450> dumbbell<00:00:06.450> rays

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
we going to do an incline dumbbell rays

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.030 
we going to do an incline dumbbell rays
which<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.259> talk<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.649> front<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
which are talk at the front of the

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.980 
which are talk at the front of the
deltoid<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.730> very<00:00:09.330> important<00:00:09.690> movement

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
deltoid a very important movement

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.629 
deltoid a very important movement
obviously<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> shoulder<00:00:11.070> has<00:00:11.190> three<00:00:11.490> heads

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
obviously the shoulder has three heads

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.820 
obviously the shoulder has three heads
one<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.300> each<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.719> every<00:00:12.960> head<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.710> is

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
one here each and every head and this is

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.930 
one here each and every head and this is
the<00:00:13.889> movement<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.219> used<00:00:14.400> for<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> front

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the movement we used for the front

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:28.880 
the movement we used for the front
deltoid<00:00:15.690> just<00:00:16.260> go<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> her<00:00:27.199> so<00:00:28.199> obviously<00:00:28.439> guys

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
deltoid just go to her so obviously guys

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
deltoid just go to her so obviously guys

with us fosters important to see lawyers
like<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.199> flat<00:00:31.439> against<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.769> bench

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
like really flat against the bench

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.850 
like really flat against the bench
that's<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:32.880> important<00:00:33.410> there's<00:00:34.410> different

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
that's very important there's different

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
that's very important there's different
angles<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.370> adjust<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.090> bench<00:00:36.410> there's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
angles you can adjust the bench there's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.520 
angles you can adjust the bench there's
no<00:00:37.559> specific<00:00:37.739> ideal<00:00:38.809> angle<00:00:39.809> maybe<00:00:40.170> bench<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
no specific ideal angle maybe bench is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
no specific ideal angle maybe bench is
different<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.890> every<00:00:40.980> different<00:00:41.190> jump<00:00:41.550> but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
different in every different jump but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.040 
different in every different jump but
we've<00:00:43.260> chosen<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.920> go<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.879> knotts<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.360> from

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
we've chosen to go for knotts down from

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.729 
we've chosen to go for knotts down from
this<00:00:46.230> particular<00:00:46.379> venture<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> incline

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
this particular venture the incline

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.500 
this particular venture the incline
dumbbell<00:00:50.480> Padres<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.579> front<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
dumbbell Padres and for the front of the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.500 
dumbbell Padres and for the front of the
shoulders<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> did<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.579> today<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
shoulders you did that one today that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
shoulders you did that one today that
was<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> pretty<00:00:58.320> tough<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.730> be

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
was a pretty tough one actually to be

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
was a pretty tough one actually to be
honest<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.410> takes<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
honest with you and it takes it into a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.030 
honest with you and it takes it into a
different<00:01:02.820> angle<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.690> having<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
different angle and having it on the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
different angle and having it on the
incline<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.900> emphasis<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.799> well

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
incline it's a lot of emphasis as well

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.530 
incline it's a lot of emphasis as well
not<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.790> shoulders<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> your

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
not only on your shoulders got on your

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
not only on your shoulders got on your
core<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.110> back<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.369> trying

core and your back you're really trying

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.300 
core and your back you're really trying
to<00:01:11.760> hold<00:01:11.939> yourself<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.960> position

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
to hold yourself in the position

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
to hold yourself in the position
especially<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.030> holding<00:01:15.509> for

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
especially when you're up holding for

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
especially when you're up holding for
three<00:01:15.990> seconds<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.860> then<00:01:17.130> coming<00:01:17.369> down<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
three seconds and then coming down and

three seconds and then coming down and
as<00:01:18.780> seen<00:01:18.990> said<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.630> Claude<00:01:21.630> rip<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
as seen said are you Claude rip which is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
as seen said are you Claude rip which is
much<00:01:23.310> better<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.240> takes<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.750> stress

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
much better because it takes the stress

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.670 
much better because it takes the stress
of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.040> wrist<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.060> holding<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.760 

nice<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> guys<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.150> seems<00:01:57.390> repetitive<00:01:57.869> well

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
nice so guys this seems repetitive well

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.649 
nice so guys this seems repetitive well
it's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> working<00:01:59.790> set<00:02:00.030> everything<00:02:00.540> we're

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it's a working set everything we're

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
it's a working set everything we're
doing<00:02:00.689> from<00:02:01.170> start<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> finish<00:02:01.830> it's

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
doing from start to finish it's

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.969 
doing from start to finish it's
continuous<00:02:03.030> work<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.869> time<00:02:03.979> so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
continuous work all the time so

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.070 
continuous work all the time so
