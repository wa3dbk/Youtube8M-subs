00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends so in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.770
 show the second part of a boxing 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 the turtles like 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 with mike 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.250
 it is also possible 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.060
 if you have not seen the first part 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:26.610
 search and in my videos comes the where 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.610
 I start with leonardo and with rafael 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.670
 legs 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.660
 when massacres arrived 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.570
 from a position 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.110
 then I remember how much more 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.990
 rudo leonardo more serene more calm 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.660
 as of your personality and mike and you see 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.920
 thinner and more playful as well as that 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.130
 being a joke 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.410
 talking dancing until now 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.690
 I think ninja turtles are these 3 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.750
 reflecting the personality of each 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.150
 It's impressive but I can 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.520
 perceive of samanÃ¡ 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.000
 so according to the personality 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000
 texts 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.399
 has a package with a bandage that covers 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.399
 Similary 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.549
 many mortals 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.700
 very good candle finishes 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 I am here a detail 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.220
 maybe not even a special song 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.220
 here 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 leaving us 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.300
 Of paint 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.510
 but at first glance it is said that I bring 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.280
 a more dangerous color chain than 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.280
 They are very well painted 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.909
 as well 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.020
 me too 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 words seems 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.130
 this design based on the movie because 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.110
 there are ninja turtles that goes generally 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.440
 with other designs like what 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.190
 nickelodeon others more but these I have not 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.830
 I saw many and I love that I like it 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.680
 We're going to put their guns 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.910
 They were forgetting that they are the chacos 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 mike and well this I do not know what wave is 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.660
 of three parts I do not know why I do not remember 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.750
 have seen that he used one of three and here 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 are your two normal chacs these 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.500
 also in good to perfection in the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.690
 Arms the hands of Miguel Angel 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 I remember that also those of Rafael and the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.370
 de leonardo has a little left 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:26.200
 few loose there are joints in the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.659
 knees in the legs also brings 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.299
 articulation reached appreciate but by 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.459
 This brings hood is tied 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.180
 a bit difficult move brings 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.250
 articulation in the shoulders and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.250
 cubits 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.740
 the battle head I will not force 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.030
 because I do not want to play them in fact not 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.700
 I'm sure if I will keep them 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.860
 I thought I would sell them as many things 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.380
 because I'm already filling up enough 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.890
 things but maybe these and less than 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:06.720
 because they are very very parents and finally 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.720
 let's go with the TV 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.849
 that maybe when I saw the 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:19.739
 cartoons many years ago those that 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:22.070
 they left my favorite was leonardo but 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.490
 after 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.490
 they gave me a detective donatello 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.139
 the exchange of many years I loved it 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.889
 the figure and was the only one that had 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.310
 then I started to have enough 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.310
 sweetie 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.870
 well I want I'm accommodating your 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.870
 your arms 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.319
 and let's see it now if the valley 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.129
 I quite like this that bringing in the 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:01.089
 head 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.610
 looks pretty highlights with the pliers 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.899
 Purple is in black on the back 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.959
 bring a backpack like that very 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.700
 very modeling technology in black 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:13.030
 It looks like 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.730
 something electronic I remove even a one 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.720
 antenna that you can appreciate more to 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:22.300
 detail and the try show I do not know how to 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.060
 calls this the truth think like stay 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:33.249
 amoral in black is quite 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:35.829
 this says a lot about us in sales 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:39.970
 white meat and also what is in 

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:42.280
 black color and I like this 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.889
 crossed this 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.240
 it's a black color 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.949
 Our land has coffee color 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.830
 and his bandana is different from the ones 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.490
 others will remember that 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.490
 background 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.599
 delgadito and rafael I bring I do not know how that 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.599
 very 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.330
 no no no 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.449
 hood in the back is 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:16.159
 is long and this has it different 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.159
 as I think it has maximum duration 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.760
 but once 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.260
 figure 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:32.830
 that I have not touched the figures that 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.240
 I did not have the way to describe him 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.520
 it's still a lot 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:43.310
 I like that he is even thinner 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.849
 more strong doubtless of rafael after 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.280
 is a leonardo after rafael sorry 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:52.669
 Miguel Angel and finally donor is the 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.710
 slimmer of the four is very father 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:58.460
 as I have done them all for all 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.500
 previous many details very well 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.790
 finished in the safe 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.590
 very good paint detail 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.070
 no doubt I loved these four 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.710
 turtles I hope you like them 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.680
 also leave me your comments tell me 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.290
 what do they think they liked they did not like 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.470
 and direction is forgetting the alarm of 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.720
 she 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:23.020
 from donatello we can put it on 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.020
 here 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:29.459
 appear also let's perfectly 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.810
 we take it out with sales forming us north 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.810
 of the canton 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.419
 they are a little clock to the legs 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.220
 Well, there are four friends 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:51.370
 ninja turtles that invented 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.220
