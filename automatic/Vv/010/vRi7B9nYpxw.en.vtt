00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 video I'm going to show you the intro of the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 song 'I ask God' is a king a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.950
 so much intermediate is not that complicated 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.950
 how they believe and check how they are 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.130
 perfect we use standard assignment 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.970
 and let's start with the position of 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.670
 the fingers this is going to be our first 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.520
 position we are going to place a brush with 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 finger number 1 on the 5th fret and with the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.190
 finger number 3 on the rope number 4 in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.190
 the number 7 fret 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.040
 and they can do it like that and put everything and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.750
 lean with this I like to do it like that and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's like you fit nothing else 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.770
 we must tread well those 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.770
 and we started with the first arrangement 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.829
 ok is 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 312 grave for 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:37.979
 Tura Tura Tura Tura Tura you more 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.619
 slow ok 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.009
 we use finger number 4 this the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.009
 skinny 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.640
 and a number one rope goes 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.640
 after number 8 again 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.130
 then we passed there tura tura height 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.440
 You are here to use 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 the technique of the pool of the pool of in the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.820
 tabla tura is represented by a letter p 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.820
 and the town indicates that we are going to pull 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.050
 with our big finger we are 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.050
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.050
 and this is the pool or scale with our 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.350
 finger to reach a sound this is with 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 the p 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.060
 ok can here for those who are in a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.890
 little more beginners because they 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 cost work is a matter that comes out 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.420
 the callus comes on the finger to make them pull 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.830
 and it does not hurt because it is very natural that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.180
 do it to us and we start with the 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.489
 placement of fingers number one finger 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.210
 rope number 3 fret number 4 the finger 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.840
 number 3 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.250
 rope number 4 fret number 6 and here 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.730
 the little one is the one that I say and I tell them 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 who suffers 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.519
 fret number seven guards number three 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:15.790
 and he's the one who pulls out that's why he's 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:18.299
 which costs more work ok 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.299
 slower 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.660
 ok let's put together these two parts 3 2 1 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.770
 ok this is repeated twice we are going to 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.520
 give us this part and then we go to 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.520
 next arrangement 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.340
 ok this is the same as putting in the position 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.390
 initial and just play with the ropes 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 the 2 number 4 helps us then nothing 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.020
 more like support on the rope on the fret 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.270
 number 7 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 ok when we make the change or this is 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.020
 slow part 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.150
 slower 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.449
 Y 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.980
 one 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.250
 and again the tour to tura tura tura tura 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.250
 you 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.000
 ok and again everything goes around 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.169
 with the 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:56.680
 degrees we went from 2 number 1 string 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.680
 number 1 fret 4 ok is our position 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.830
 ah 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.830
 ok slower 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.780
 no no 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.370
 and so much 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.370
 and the final arrangement is coming 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.979
 but 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.860
 ok we are in this position we stay 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.919
 of 2 number 4 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.919
 Fret number 7 and this one slides 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.099
 what we slide until 10 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.850
 from here and we make the arrangement 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.430
 d 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.020
 ok slower 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.760
 and we slide with 3 and we're going to do it 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.590
 all all everything at medium slow speed and 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.590
 already a little faster 3 slow 3 2 1 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:45.060
 and before 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.060
 no no 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.840
 although there is an average speed and already 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:56.050
 her from you to give you the 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.050
 adequate speed ok 321 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.259
 and 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.770
 7 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:26.000
 efe 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.280
 ok after the tutorial 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.750
 it's a little bit more intermediate tutorial 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.870
 let's go though also more riffs 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.120
