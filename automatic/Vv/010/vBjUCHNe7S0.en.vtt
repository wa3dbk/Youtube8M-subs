a look at this as you look at it the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
a look at this as you look at it the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
idea this is to go ahead and force in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
idea this is to go ahead and force in
this<00:01:10.080> case<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> wind<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.070> being

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
this case it's going to wind up being

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.190 
this case it's going to wind up being
the<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:11.970> tackle<00:01:12.270> look<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> block<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the right tackle look to block to the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
the right tackle look to block to the
inside<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:13.890> least<00:01:14.010> try<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> change<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
inside or at least try to change the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.390 
inside or at least try to change the
blocking<00:01:15.180> assignments<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.860> happens

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
blocking assignments up if that happens

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
blocking assignments up if that happens
then<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.060> looking<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> go

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then what we're looking for is to go

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.350 
then what we're looking for is to go
ahead<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.409> apply<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.710> pressure<00:01:20.220> coming<00:01:21.090> off

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
ahead and apply this pressure coming off

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850 
ahead and apply this pressure coming off
the<00:01:21.540> edge<00:01:21.750> from<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.170> defender<00:01:22.530> right<00:01:22.680> here

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the edge from this defender right here

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.780 
the edge from this defender right here
so<00:01:22.979> we're<00:01:23.100> looking<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.460> ahead<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.700> get

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so we're looking to go ahead and get

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.760 
so we're looking to go ahead and get
that<00:01:23.820> pressure<00:01:24.180> coming<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> edge<00:01:24.990> from

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that pressure coming off the edge from

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
that pressure coming off the edge from
this<00:01:26.009> left<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.670> he<00:01:26.759> comes<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.270> goes

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this left in as he comes in and goes

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.060 
this left in as he comes in and goes
after<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> quarterback<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:28.890> we're

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
after the quarterback and then we're

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.230 
after the quarterback and then we're
also<00:01:29.130> looking<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.640> pressure<00:01:29.850> coming<00:01:30.150> from

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
also looking to get pressure coming from

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
also looking to get pressure coming from
this<00:01:30.420> guy<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> that's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this guy right here as well and that's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.690 
this guy right here as well and that's
going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> wind<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.189> being<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.490> right

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
going to wind up being that right

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
going to wind up being that right
outside<00:01:32.880> linebackers<00:01:33.689> let's<00:01:34.049> go<00:01:34.229> ahead<00:01:34.320> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
outside linebackers let's go ahead and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.569 
outside linebackers let's go ahead and
do<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> we're<00:01:35.009> holding<00:01:35.189> down<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> right

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
do that we're holding down the right

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.580 
do that we're holding down the right
trigger<00:01:35.790> before<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.329> snap<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> once<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
trigger before the snap and once the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.929 
trigger before the snap and once the
ball<00:01:37.710> snap<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.520> release<00:01:38.759> them

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
ball snap we just go in and release them

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670 
ball snap we just go in and release them
and<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.479> drop<00:01:39.689> him<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.350> he<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.530> going

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and we drop him back as if he was going

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.679 
and we drop him back as if he was going
to<00:01:40.710> drop<00:01:40.890> back<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.340> hook<00:01:41.549> zone<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to drop back in that hook zone and that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.850 
to drop back in that hook zone and that
allows<00:01:42.960> us<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.290> go<00:01:43.439> ahead<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.799> that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
allows us to go ahead and get that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.280 
allows us to go ahead and get that
pressure<00:01:44.369> from<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.909> only<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.240> left<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
pressure from not only the left in but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
pressure from not only the left in but
also<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.860> linebacker<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.640> wound<00:01:47.729> up

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
also from that linebacker so we wound up

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.219 
also from that linebacker so we wound up
getting<00:01:48.030> double<00:01:48.390> pressure<00:01:48.630> coming<00:01:48.930> from<00:01:49.020> both

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
getting double pressure coming from both

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.740 
getting double pressure coming from both
sides<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.829> realize<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.299> both<00:01:51.299> backs<00:01:51.570> are

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
sides now I realize that both backs are

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.060 
sides now I realize that both backs are
going<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> things

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
going out so that's one of the things

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
going out so that's one of the things
that<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> lot<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.210> lot<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.720> videos

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that you see a lot of a lot of videos

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.240 
that you see a lot of a lot of videos
you'll<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> lot<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.680> showing<00:01:55.890> both<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you'll see a lot of guys showing both of

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.469 
you'll see a lot of guys showing both of
them<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> these<00:01:57.420> guys

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
them going out now if one of these guys

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.149 
them going out now if one of these guys
were<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.990> stay<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> past<00:01:58.560> block<00:01:58.890> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
were just stay in the past block for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.550 
were just stay in the past block for
instance<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> full-back<00:02:00.149> was<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.290> stay<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
instance a the full-back was to stay in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.679 
instance a the full-back was to stay in
the<00:02:01.680> past<00:02:01.890> block<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.399> towards<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> left<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the past block here towards the left and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.200 
the past block here towards the left and
this<00:02:03.780> area<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.469> then<00:02:05.369> we'd<00:02:05.700> wind<00:02:06.119> up

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this area here and then we'd wind up

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.819 
this area here and then we'd wind up
still<00:02:06.450> getting<00:02:06.719> pressure<00:02:06.990> coming<00:02:07.469> off<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
still getting pressure coming off the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.229 
still getting pressure coming off the
edge<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.429> guy<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:08.819> from<00:02:09.090> this

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
edge from this guy right here from this

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.570 
edge from this guy right here from this
left<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.840> or<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.800> case<00:02:10.860> say<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.430> maybe

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
left in or in this case say that maybe

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.740 
left in or in this case say that maybe
this<00:02:11.790> fullback<00:02:12.690> was<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> stay<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.440> past

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
this fullback was to stay in the past

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
this fullback was to stay in the past
block<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.230> side<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.680> he'd<00:02:14.860> wind<00:02:15.130> up

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
block to this side and he'd wind up

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.590 
block to this side and he'd wind up
blocking<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.760> pressure<00:02:16.000> that's<00:02:16.180> coming<00:02:16.480> off

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
blocking the pressure that's coming off

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660 
blocking the pressure that's coming off
the<00:02:16.750> edge<00:02:16.900> from<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.290> left<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.040> yet<00:02:18.520> we

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the edge from the left in and yet we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.100 
the edge from the left in and yet we
still<00:02:18.880> wind<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.240> getting<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.570> pressure<00:02:19.840> here

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
still wind up getting this pressure here

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.930 
still wind up getting this pressure here
so<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:21.010> I'm<00:02:21.070> trying<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.310> show<00:02:21.520> here<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.820> that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
so what I'm trying to show here is that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.160 
so what I'm trying to show here is that
you're<00:02:22.090> still<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.510> wind<00:02:22.720> up<00:02:22.840> getting

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
you're still going to wind up getting

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.290 
you're still going to wind up getting
pressure<00:02:23.460> even<00:02:24.460> if<00:02:24.550> they<00:02:24.640> leave<00:02:24.820> at<00:02:24.940> least<00:02:25.030> one

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
pressure even if they leave at least one

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.430 
pressure even if they leave at least one
back<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> past<00:02:25.960> protect<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.380> they

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
back in the past protect and they

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.050 
back in the past protect and they
probably<00:02:26.590> will<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.040> most<00:02:27.250> case<00:02:27.490> especially<00:02:27.760> if

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
probably will at most case especially if

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.280 
probably will at most case especially if
you<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> blitz<00:02:28.630> a<00:02:28.720> lot<00:02:28.900> they<00:02:29.020> catch<00:02:29.170> you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you like to blitz a lot they catch you

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.140 
you like to blitz a lot they catch you
doing<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.430> keep<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.730> mind<00:02:30.970> so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
doing that so just keep that in mind so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.340 
doing that so just keep that in mind so
as<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.330> watch<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.110> see<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
as you watch this you can see the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.130 
as you watch this you can see the
pressure<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.890> coming<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> gut<00:02:33.970> from<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
pressure is coming up the gut from the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.449 
pressure is coming up the gut from the
as<00:02:35.380> far<00:02:35.560> as<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> B<00:02:35.830> gap<00:02:36.010> from<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.340> right

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
as far as the B gap from the right

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.949 
as far as the B gap from the right
outside<00:02:36.610> linebacker<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.780> also

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
outside linebacker and then you can also

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.180 
outside linebacker and then you can also
see<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.230> we're<00:02:38.440> getting<00:02:38.500> pressure<00:02:38.830> from<00:02:38.920> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
see that we're getting pressure from the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.580 
see that we're getting pressure from the
outside<00:02:39.580> from<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.630> left<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.230> this<00:02:41.350> makes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
outside from the left in so this makes

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.590 
outside from the left in so this makes
this<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> pretty<00:02:42.070> nice<00:02:42.310> defense<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:43.270> as<00:02:43.390> far<00:02:43.540> as

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
this a pretty nice defense now as far as

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.140 
this a pretty nice defense now as far as
the<00:02:43.750> coverages<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.610> go<00:02:45.610> ahead<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.820> zoom<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the coverages go go ahead and zoom in a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.370 
the coverages go go ahead and zoom in a
little<00:02:46.239> bit<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.600> we<00:02:46.690> concentrate<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.290> this

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
little bit and we concentrate on this

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.630 
little bit and we concentrate on this
guy<00:02:47.560> right<00:02:47.770> here<00:02:47.830> remember<00:02:48.250> we're<00:02:48.430> holding

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
guy right here remember we're holding

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.100 
guy right here remember we're holding
down<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.120> trigger<00:02:49.390> before<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.870> snap

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
down that right trigger before the snap

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.199 
down that right trigger before the snap
and<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.860> idea<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.310> showed<00:02:51.489> before<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:52.120> they

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
and the idea is I showed before is they

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.610 
and the idea is I showed before is they
try<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.450> get<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> right<00:02:52.989> tackle<00:02:53.380> look<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
try to get that right tackle look the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.870 
try to get that right tackle look the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
block towards them you can see on your

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.340 
block towards them you can see on your
screen<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.450> that's<00:02:55.630> what<00:02:55.780> he<00:02:55.840> does<00:02:56.080> he

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
screen that that's what he does he

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.500 
screen that that's what he does he
