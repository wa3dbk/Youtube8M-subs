00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.160
 today our program is ours 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.590
 the journey does not begin very normally and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.759
 the message is traditionally flat we will 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.809
 watch what is called ve-2 li from scratch 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.730
 so the first block of our program 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 will be dedicated to the apartment exactly in such 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.859
 the form in which she here we found it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.269
 very interesting because then there will be 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.539
 curious to see what happens 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.300
 Irina about glass I already know the talented 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.099
 man let's start with the general to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 who owns this apartment what 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 This is where the design is started and which ones 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.840
 had to work the case in order to 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.239
 turn it into a cozy space 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 when I met the owner of this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 apartments she produced on me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 the impression is very sunny bright 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 such a cheerful person to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120
 who meets in our life 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.840
 infrequently and she told me yo come on 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.789
 make out of this apartment in which i 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 even on an autumn day I would like to 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.859
 come back and despite maybe what 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 thats not okay at work what not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 I would like them to be on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.580
 I always have some kind of weather myself 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 and here was spring joyful 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.380
 mood like to drink and actually 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.909
 here it was 1. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.500
 which it was necessary to push me and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.180
 naturally with her given her desire 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.610
 because we walked with her 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.270
 shopping and we will still go yes that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.000
 not all selected 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.909
 not all points are clear how we will do 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.060
 and all in the end to collect it in the rainbow 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.340
 just such notes and mood in general is 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 nine-story apartment in principle 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 small enough new guests here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.310
 there will be a lot of some accents 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.319
 design will have something to look for in 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.929
 particular we are in the kitchen and the kitchen 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.729
 must be admitted spacious enough though 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.979
 one person will live here yes we are 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.890
 originally planned and reasoned 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.590
 to make a kitchen from a room and a kitchen 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.409
 in the end we still came to the conclusion that 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.470
 she really is 1 being very liquid 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.119
 beautiful adorable here and in the end we 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.420
 decided to still leave two rooms 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.310
 a kitchen where there will be many guests here 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.360
 the apron is laid already in sight here 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.430
 really such a sum 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.079
 sunny spring up must in the field 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.849
 blue summer theme because it 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:19.390
 more like some kind of tropical 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.099
 motives here I would say from gray well 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 as you can see on the screens 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.470
 viewers gray-blue such walls and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.049
 and the dominant part of the apron is perfectly 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.090
 true yellow because we will have bright 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.880
 yellow kitchen set 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.609
 yes here and so unusual quite 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.190
 right but wait a little later when 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.410
 you are here to the end 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.829
 understandably bath is enough too 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.900
 spacious well-known brand 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.630
 collaborate with our programs and kerama 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.730
 marazzi is really very brave 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.799
 the solution is red i'm generally very 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.849
 love this collection kerama marazzi she 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.769
 very brave and I think such a tank for 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.450
 design solutions but again there wasnâ€™t 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.000
 opportunities to turn around because 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.740
 will lead 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.350
 here we have a very small area and 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.410
 task kid node very much here and 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.350
 I wanted to make it bright joyfully urgently we 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.780
 came to something to what would twigs in 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.280
 form by but we will have to accent 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.200
 I will only say attention to the main ones 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.830
 sights of the bathroom 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.920
 This is a sink with a backlight and yes 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.680
 not so let's see just a little bit 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.520
 relax well and the hall is the most important 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.740
 room which will be bedroom dash 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.090
 Terra Guest Room and the harbor itself 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.440
 which mistress will want to return 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.390
 therefore there will also be some 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.160
 bright colors here is the first thing I see it 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.250
 lack of centering lamp 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.560
 this is a traditional traditional decision yes 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.600
 again we left this why because 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.790
 that it was necessary to somehow divide this but 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.430
 not very big rooms only 21 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.010
 square on the zone where it really will be 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.320
 desktop marked the sofa which 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.600
 will flick of the wrist turn 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.700
 in bed and at the same time in 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.160
 folded it will be the place where 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.490
 we will sit reading possible visa and 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.470
 watch TV that is 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.990
 I offered to leave the central council 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.750
 on the so-called bells illuminate 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.010
 exactly the area where the sofa will stand 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.410
 separately will light up 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.810
 the ceiling is exactly along the window because 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.680
 near the window always 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.690
 I put the desktop no matter and the cabinet 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.700
 or nursery because natural light 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.610
 and it is very important to our vision and road 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.650
 health and certainly so small 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.930
 tongue which will emphasize 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.350
 decorative panel on this wall too 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.080
 form the ceiling lighting and again 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.920
 accentuate the beautiful big moment 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.770
 expensive tv cinema nightstands 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.020
 Well, promising a little pictures I 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.430
 about the head already had what 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.310
 you'll see will see in five minutes 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.600
 the art of mounting the mass will help out already 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.260
 see the finished apartment is not 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.260
 switch
