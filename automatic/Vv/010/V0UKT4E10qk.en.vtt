that is what you have to type in but
this<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.369> numbers<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:22.080> depends<00:01:22.409> on

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this these numbers here that depends on

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.749 
this these numbers here that depends on
how<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.939> RAM<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:25.040> have<00:01:26.040> quite<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> lot

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
how much RAM you have I have quite a lot

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.969 
how much RAM you have I have quite a lot
so<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.390> give<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> 4<00:01:27.990> gigs<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so I can give it 4 gigs but just for the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.520 
so I can give it 4 gigs but just for the
purpose<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.549> tutorial<00:01:30.439> stop<00:01:31.439> them

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
purpose of this tutorial stop them

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
purpose of this tutorial stop them
screen<00:01:31.770> recorder<00:01:32.220> from<00:01:32.310> lagging<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.790> i'll

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
screen recorder from lagging out i'll

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.420 
screen recorder from lagging out i'll
give<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:35.450> 11.24<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.130> don't<00:01:38.310> want

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
give it 11.24 so really you don't want

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
give it 11.24 so really you don't want
to<00:01:38.490> give<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:38.850> map<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.600> ninety<00:01:40.020> percent

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to give it all map like ninety percent

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
to give it all map like ninety percent
or<00:01:40.500> eighty<00:01:40.619> percent<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.310> might<00:01:41.460> express

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
or eighty percent or you might express

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.480 
or eighty percent or you might express
to<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.659> system<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.409> completely<00:01:44.100> grind

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
got a bit of a whitelist going on okay

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.390
