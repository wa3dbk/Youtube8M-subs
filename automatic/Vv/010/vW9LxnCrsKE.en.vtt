last couple years and really I would say
that<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.020> helmet<00:02:45.230> is<00:02:45.410> probably<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.860> most

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
that this helmet is probably the most

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.740 
that this helmet is probably the most

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
adventurous time with the icon is done I

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.330 
adventurous time with the icon is done I
would<00:02:48.050> say<00:02:48.170> it's<00:02:48.260> coming<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.710> age<00:02:48.860> for<00:02:49.040> icon

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
would say it's coming of age for icon
