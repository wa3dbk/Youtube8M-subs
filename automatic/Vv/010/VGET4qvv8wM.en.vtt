00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.410 

okay<00:00:01.550> I<00:00:02.550> did<00:00:02.879> an<00:00:03.030> f-sharp<00:00:03.240> um<00:00:04.940> mixolydian<00:00:05.940> with

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
okay I did an f-sharp um mixolydian with

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.470 
okay I did an f-sharp um mixolydian with
a<00:00:06.450> flat<00:00:06.690> 9<00:00:06.870> chord<00:00:11.059> now<00:00:12.059> we're<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> move

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
a flat 9 chord now we're going to move

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.079 
a flat 9 chord now we're going to move
that<00:00:12.690> whole<00:00:12.809> thing<00:00:13.049> down<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.559> half<00:00:14.309> step<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.940> F

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
that whole thing down a half step to F

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.029 
that whole thing down a half step to F
and<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> same<00:00:15.929> thing<00:00:18.650> we're<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> get

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
and do the same thing we're going to get

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.939 
and do the same thing we're going to get
basically<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.670> an<00:00:20.789> F<00:00:21.029> Lydian<00:00:23.000> F<00:00:24.000> Lydian<00:00:24.600> chord

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.110 

okay<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.400> basically<00:00:30.119> F<00:00:30.510> Lydian<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
okay so basically F Lydian is is the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.500 
okay so basically F Lydian is is the
fourth<00:00:33.120> degree<00:00:33.570> scale<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> key<00:00:34.410> key<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.160> C

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
fourth degree scale in the key key of C

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.400 
fourth degree scale in the key key of C
so<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> something<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> could<00:00:37.290> use

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so this would be something you could use

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:49.250 
so this would be something you could use
maybe<00:00:37.649> Nakia<00:00:38.070> see

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 

and<00:00:49.380> and<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.490> the<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.880> same<00:00:51.060> thing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and and so the kind of same thing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
and and so the kind of same thing
applies<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.080> is<00:00:52.200> with<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.560> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
applies with this one is with the the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
applies with this one is with the the
f-sharp<00:00:53.010> mixolydian<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> use<00:00:54.960> any<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
f-sharp mixolydian one we can use any of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
f-sharp mixolydian one we can use any of
the<00:00:55.350> notes<00:00:55.530> condition<00:00:56.520> use<00:00:56.610> open<00:00:56.880> up<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.120> e

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the notes condition use open up the e

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.890 
the notes condition use open up the e
string<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.090> would<00:01:00.240> be<00:01:00.360> an<00:01:00.450> F<00:01:00.690> major

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
string and that would be an F major

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300 
string and that would be an F major
seven<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.380> could<00:01:01.530> open<00:01:01.740> up<00:01:01.830> the<00:01:01.950> B<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.220> the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
seven we could open up the B in the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.660 
seven we could open up the B in the
eastern<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.589> there's<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.770> sharp<00:01:05.070> 11<00:01:05.520> your

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
eastern and there's your sharp 11 your

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060 
eastern and there's your sharp 11 your
Lydian<00:01:06.150> tone<00:01:06.450> okay<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.050> bees<00:01:07.260> represents

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Lydian tone okay the bees represents

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.899 
Lydian tone okay the bees represents
kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> sharp<00:01:08.550> four<00:01:08.910> or<00:01:09.180> sharp<00:01:09.420> eleven

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
kind of a sharp four or sharp eleven

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.910 
kind of a sharp four or sharp eleven
and<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:11.689> there's<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.229> e<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.530> top<00:01:12.560> which<00:01:12.890> is

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
and then there's the e on top which is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.440 
and then there's the e on top which is
you<00:01:13.100> make<00:01:13.219> your<00:01:13.369> seventh<00:01:13.640> or<00:01:13.850> if<00:01:13.939> I<00:01:14.000> open<00:01:14.360> up

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
you make your seventh or if I open up

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.710 
you make your seventh or if I open up
the<00:01:16.390> g-string<00:01:18.610> we<00:01:19.610> get<00:01:19.759> kind<00:01:19.909> of<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.119> ninth<00:01:20.420> in

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
the g-string we get kind of the ninth in

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.690 
the g-string we get kind of the ninth in
there<00:01:20.930> G<00:01:21.380> with<00:01:21.590> midnight<00:01:21.860> -<00:01:22.189> easier<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.549> count

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
there G with midnight - easier to count

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.760 
there G with midnight - easier to count
up<00:01:22.909> in<00:01:23.689> athlean<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.100> scale<00:01:25.369> 1<00:01:25.729> 2<00:01:26.030> 3<00:01:26.329> 4<00:01:26.689> 5<00:01:26.990> 6<00:01:27.320> 7

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
8 9 XG that's how we got to name the 9th

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.380 
8 9 XG that's how we got to name the 9th
tonight<00:01:32.869> 9<00:01:33.259> degrees<00:01:33.619> up<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.039> could<00:01:35.000> also<00:01:35.119> open

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
tonight 9 degrees up I could also open

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.730 
tonight 9 degrees up I could also open
up<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.539> T<00:01:35.720> Street<00:01:36.009> okay<00:01:37.240> that's<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:38.450> of<00:01:38.479> cool

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
up the T Street okay that's kind of cool

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.440 
up the T Street okay that's kind of cool
so<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:39.770> I've<00:01:40.039> got<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.250> 6th<00:01:40.819> in<00:01:40.970> there<00:01:41.149> as<00:01:41.240> well

so now I've got a 6th in there as well
and<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.200> could<00:01:42.319> open<00:01:42.409> up<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.799> string<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
and it could open up the a string and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.010 
and it could open up the a string and
just<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.939> all<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:44.390> is<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.630> first<00:01:44.840> figure

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
just have all I have is the first figure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.219 
just have all I have is the first figure
on<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.349> bottom<00:01:45.380> string<00:01:47.080> technically<00:01:48.080> that

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
on the bottom string technically that

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.630 
on the bottom string technically that
would<00:01:48.349> be<00:01:48.409> kind<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.799> an<00:01:49.220> F<00:01:49.939> major<00:01:51.189> 13<00:01:52.189> with<00:01:52.610> a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
would be kind of an F major 13 with a

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.230 
would be kind of an F major 13 with a
sharp<00:01:53.119> 11<00:01:53.569> a<00:01:53.950> little<00:01:54.950> muddy<00:01:55.220> sunny<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:56.090> could

sharp 11 a little muddy sunny you could
do<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.420> like<00:01:56.539> this<00:01:59.619> J<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:00.649> hit<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.039> harmonics<00:02:01.849> on

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
do it like this J I hit the harmonics on

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.289 
do it like this J I hit the harmonics on
the<00:02:02.090> 12th<00:02:02.390> fret<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.840> top<00:02:03.530> 5<00:02:03.770> strengths<00:02:07.299> you

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
the 12th fret the top 5 strengths you

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.609 
the 12th fret the top 5 strengths you
just<00:02:08.479> grab<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.810> note<00:02:09.019> there<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.319> got<00:02:09.500> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
just grab that note there and you got it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.470 
just grab that note there and you got it
have<00:02:11.260> major<00:02:12.260> 13<00:02:12.739> with<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> sharp<00:02:13.220> 11<00:02:13.579> or<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.390> just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
have major 13 with a sharp 11 or I just

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:35.949 
have major 13 with a sharp 11 or I just
kind<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:14.959> caught<00:02:15.109> like<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.380> F<00:02:15.500> lady<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.920> thing

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959

all<00:02:36.959> right<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.380> that's<00:02:37.650> just<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.240> F<00:02:39.240> Lydian

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
all right so that's just the F Lydian

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.800 
all right so that's just the F Lydian
chord<00:02:41.090> well<00:02:42.090> I'll<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.300> call<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.630> that

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
chord well I'll just call it that

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.880 
chord well I'll just call it that
because<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> easiest<00:02:43.709> way<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
because that's the easiest way to
