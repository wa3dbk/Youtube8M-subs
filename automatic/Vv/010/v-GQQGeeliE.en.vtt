00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.460
 Hello 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.180
 as promised today the dedicated video 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.670
 instead to a look that I thought of for 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.450
 New Year 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.840
 obviously it all depends on how 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.100
 you will spend the evening but you know that 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.530
 in short, today we can do these things 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.539
 exaggerate a little more and the look that 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.399
 I had already realized previously for 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:39.739
 Christmas that you take it a lot 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.659
 whimsical full of glitter is perfect 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.390
 no doubt also for the night of 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:46.609
 New Year if not more but I had decided 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.120
 not to overdo it since I already had it 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.219
 made several make up rather 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.829
 simple and wearable that were perfect 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.929
 for that occasion then I refer you 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.179
 also then the video if you can be interested 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.219
 and this time if the last time used 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.129
 I decided to use silver instead 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.900
 and black, of course, as it is worth 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.200
 for all my clothes you can use i 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.030
 colors you prefer and I don't know 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.979
 because with the new year I see more 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.289
 silver but it all depends on the end from 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.689
 what we're going to wear that night 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.280
 and obviously I'm not telling you that though 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.030
 you dress me in red from the arms network of 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.890
 red my god no don't do it please 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 But here's a minimum let's go for sure 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.420
 always looking for that color that is 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.250
 well with what we have on this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 video is also in collaboration with 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 another girl named daniela 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.079

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.689

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.720
 to add except that in short ,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.540
 you have done for as Christmas as you have 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.660
 past Christmas instead and above all 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 because I'm super curious what you have 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.160
 found under the tree 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.850
 I know I'm nosy but I couldn't 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.989
 just to do without asking though and 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.060
 let me also know how you will pass the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.130
 New Year I will definitely not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.970
 surely I will be perfect with mine 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.489
 boy is my friends dancing before 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.330
 the family dinner and then after 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.290
 midnight definitely dancing 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.060
 as there will undoubtedly also be 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.520
 Valentine realistic for eleven that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.990
 voice of the very fine connecting but I will 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.070
 I love you darling and nothing I think 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.060
 this time I can really leave myself 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.890
 tutorial or already spread the primer and the 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.740
 next step and the application of 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.570
 this astra eye shadow number 071 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.400
 beautiful white ice color for the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.260
 choices that I extend over the entire eyelid 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.540
 mobile and also to the inner corner from a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.390
 really very bright effect at 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.480
 look from the palermo king of make up 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.280
 it happens I take the black I extend with 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.760
 an angled brush at the hairline 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.459
 lower lashes and I can create 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.060
 also the codeine of my eyeliner that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.470
 make it even quite long by doing it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.410
 coincide with the end of mine 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.420
 eyebrow and then trace precisely the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.040
 very simple eyeliner line these 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.739
 they will be guidelines that I will then go to 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.560
 to go over with liner just while in 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.860
 case of errors the eyeshadow definitely me 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.840
 will allow to correct in time and a 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.360
 port in black even in the fold 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.480
 of the eye as you can see by creating 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.910
 this castris and healing very well 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.820
 the outer corner creating this shape of 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.390
 and then faded the eyeshadow applied in the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.220
 the rest of the eye also bends 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.010
 but of course I concentrate above all 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.710
 in the fold always from the same gym 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.660
 frico instead the cream under the arch 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.760
 eyebrows and silver color 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.160
 at the outer corner above all 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.350
 astra cream color that he had 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.090
 previously applied 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.250
 and here is the passage that there is 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.230
 I had already anticipated where I go to 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:53.670
 take black with aj liner and with 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.180
 a black pencil instead I go to 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.400
 in short, apply it to the internal rhyme 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.640
 both upper and lower eye 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.880
 and then the black over the civilians faded 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.260
 lower I correct my dark circles e 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:15.810
 therefore I also improve the shape of mine 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.840
 eyeliner thanks to the mascara concealer 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.250
 sicilia superior and inferior 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.930
 abundantly it is obviously who has 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.220
 want to apply false eyelashes 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.890
 body contouring absolutely can not 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.600
 miss for this occasion and then 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.940
 also being a blush rosÃ© e 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.950
 of the illuminant on the cheekbones e 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.630
 on the bow of cupid as a lipstick 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.210
 absolutely red and this by now 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.700
 you know one of my favorites and the 84's 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.440
 kiko if you think it's a look too 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.150
 heavy since the eyes anyway 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.280
 they are already pretty showy will go 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.490
 very well obviously a nude lipstick 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.980
 everything depends on your taste I correct 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.530
 then the edges of the oils of the 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.380
 lipstick any smudges with del 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.150
 checker this is the finished look 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.160
 let me know in the comments what it is 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.660
 think about whether you like it or not 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.100
 now I leave you with daniele's video 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.640

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.470
