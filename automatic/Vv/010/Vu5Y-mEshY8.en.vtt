00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.270
 with legality 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.660
 for girls welcome once again to the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.330
 today's recipe for our recipe today 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.619
 We are going to need 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 glas 200 grams of marshmallows or clouds 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.169
 as they say in Spain and a little 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.279
 butter butter we're going to 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:36.120
 occupy to oil our mold where 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.829
 let's put our chocolates then 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.829
 let's oil 1 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.660
 good and as you can see in our 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 hands because we're also going to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.060
 need with butter then let's go 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.310
 to grab our 25 grams of 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.690
 marshmallows 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:04.200
 chocolates clouds as they want to say and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.860
 We bring it to the microwave 2 to 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:11.750
 put 2 intervals of 15 seconds each 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.750
 one to melt 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.440
 we have given the first 15 seconds and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.690
 here they are already beginning to do 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.010
 our chocolates are going to give them the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.010
 another 15 seconds 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.759
 so that it melts in a little bit well 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.469
 do not give him much time because if he does not 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.270
 can burn our chocolates and 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.789
 then we would have our fondant 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.460
 has gone to request a beating if the 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:48.579
 beating we are also going to grease the with 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.579
 a little 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.530
 it's been 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.180
 how can you see 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.180
 our pompons have already been decided 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.500
 let's mix them a little 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.330
 and this is the consistency we want 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.470
 the power of your microwave and the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 seconds can bathe then if they see 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.510
 that not neglected yet here can you 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.210
 give another 15 seconds but try to 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 we are chocolates then like 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.190
 you can see we already have here so our 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.290
 mobile then let's start mixing 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.290
 to put our sugar 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.670
 we can put it little by little 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.270
 or empty the entire direct and start 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.650
 knead but everything was agreed to do 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.650
 a bit ethical 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.420
 ah 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.770
 and good a little bit of sugar 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.470
 do not forget to put on some 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.490
 butter and the brothers who go to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.490
 occupy to kill 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.650
 now if we spread all the wings 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.269
 in powder no 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.269
 and we started doing 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.010
 I forgot to tell them we're going to 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.470
 also need a spoonful of water 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.360
 this spoonful of water can change it 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.340
 or substitute essence of the flavor that 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.970
 you want orange coconut if 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.880
 They want their wonderful fondant to have 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.340
 taste if I 'm not, it can be nothing 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.380
 more the water or put it in instead of the 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.200
 water spoon one teaspoon 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.450
 vanilla to give him below 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.510
 remember to put water in the middle of 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.489
 process because if they put it in the end 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.430
 already absolved with our fondant the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.290
 icing sugar and should be placed at the end of the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.660
 spoon to the water our background is going to 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.330
 be very watery and they will need more 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 sugar the then your ass impose it the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.680
 scoop water in the middle of the process to 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.680
 that do not fall apart 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.300
 let's put him 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.400
 our spoons and water remember not 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.910
 get it wrong from our water spoon 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.669
 because the consistency of our 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.560
 Marshmallow can change and 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.580
 we would need more icing sugar 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.750
 and see what they have left 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.199
 very supported its mass and can put more 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.199
 sugar 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.170
 efe 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.500
 ah 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.500
 and we continue more until 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.930
 Well, as you can see, I followed her 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.610
 killing here on this fret that you guys 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.700
 they want to do it in the goal they can 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.470
 do but then there is no 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.550
 inconvenient that they keep doing it for 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.600
 do as you can see 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.300
 so we have our deepest already 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.479
 can stretch 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.479
 if you feel you are still paid 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.430
 to me no longer I stick your hands well if 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.889
 you are still sticking your hands 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.180
 you can put a little more 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.780
 of sugar glas 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.990
 so that they fit 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:11.340
 moldable and so and as you can see here 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.080
 is and as we know that it is already 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.590
 We start a little bit and make a 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.020
 little ball and there is no fold left 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.419
 then we see that our 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.699
 fondant to make the figures that 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.310
 we want if you want 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.740
 I make colorful fondant I recommend 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.320
 they do it with coloring 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.690
 fuel peyron gel because if it goes 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.090
 adding liquid our consistency 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.610
 of our fund can change and can 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.800
 be more water can you again 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.289
 incorporate they returned a little bit more than 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.699
 icing sugar 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:47.520
 or if not also buy chocolates 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.500
 yellow absurd roses are amen and 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.620
 colors of the chocolates and they would be 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.020
 more beautiful the coloring and with the same 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.120
 consistency 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.910
 and good and nothing else to store 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.000
 our putting we are going to need this 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.909
 Transparent plastic film or like 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.509
 you would tell him and this we are going to 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:10.280
 occupy to save our fund not what 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.560
 they can let stand in the refrigerator 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.289
 or outside in the replicator are going to 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.659
 put a little bit of one but to be able 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:20.599
 learn it put the 20 seconds another 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:24.260
 once in the microwave and will be again 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:27.140
 variable our format before 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.570
 grabbing our fondant our 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.639
 masitas I have here so is the 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:35.710
 to make balls and put them well 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:39.900
 a lot of people like to let 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:43.510
 respond with occupy it like this 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:47.530
 we are going to let it rest

 a day or so and we will occupy it for 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.640
 make a noisy appointment without even seeing 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.830
