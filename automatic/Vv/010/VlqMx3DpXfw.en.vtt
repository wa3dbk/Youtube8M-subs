with<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.649> said<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.069> dimensions<00:02:11.519> are<00:02:11.640> 5<00:02:11.849> by<00:02:12.030> 5

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
for the normal hanging decal so that's

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.660 
for the normal hanging decal so that's
longing<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.299> keep<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.599> as<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
longing to keep it as now I just you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.039 
longing to keep it as now I just you
could<00:02:17.819> also<00:02:18.030> scan<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.600> if<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> don't<00:02:18.959> want

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
could also scan it in if you don't want

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.170 
could also scan it in if you don't want
to<00:02:19.200> measure<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:19.920> originally<00:02:20.639> I<00:02:20.940> would

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to measure it out but originally I would

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.180 
to measure it out but originally I would
have<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.780> dimension<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.769> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> still

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
have it this dimension so this is still

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.180 
have it this dimension so this is still
5<00:02:23.370> by<00:02:23.519> 5<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.510> rotate<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.350> look<00:02:26.040> like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
5 by 5 and then I rotate it to look like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.590 
5 by 5 and then I rotate it to look like
a<00:02:26.220> diamond<00:02:26.489> because<00:02:27.030> that's<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.389> way<00:02:27.480> it's

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
work but it won't go on this evenly but

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.720 
work but it won't go on this evenly but
again<00:04:44.680> this<00:04:44.830> is<00:04:44.980> your<00:04:45.100> crep<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.430> do<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.640> how

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
again this is your crep you do it how

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.150 
again this is your crep you do it how
you<00:04:45.760> want<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.150> once<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.710> all<00:04:47.890> dried

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.430 
you want to once you have that all dried
and<00:04:48.400> sent<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:49.030> next<00:04:49.270> step<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.900> reinforce

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
and sent the next step is to reinforce

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.140 
and sent the next step is to reinforce
it<00:04:50.830> with<00:04:50.980> some<00:04:51.130> bristol<00:04:51.460> board<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:52.120> I

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
it with some bristol board what I

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.000 
it with some bristol board what I
suggest<00:04:52.660> is<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:52.960> use<00:04:53.080> two<00:04:53.470> pieces<00:04:53.740> of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
suggest is that you use two pieces of

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.100 
suggest is that you use two pieces of
bristol<00:04:54.310> board<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.970> size<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.570> paper<00:04:55.780> and

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
bristol board the size of the paper and

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.570 
bristol board the size of the paper and
glue<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.470> back<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.950> as<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.400> want
