00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.009
 good afternoon from the carriers 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.580
 outside the municipal palace 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.439
 you dealership is I am a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 dictionary I am site president 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.640
 star I am president of the alliance and 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.289
 I'm going to say something politically I'm 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.750
 transport coordinator within the 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.770
 I am the technical secretary of the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.650
 multimodal national transport 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.950
 I thought then that the reason is for the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.010
 violation of the transport law itself 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.440
 so we want them to respect each other 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.380
 the rights of carriers and 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.390
 established, we want you to stick to the 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.670
 transportation law where it has not been 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.309
 respected where there is no study there 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.290
 council meeting has been convened this 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.660
 is a series of irregularities and where 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.150
 It was published where he was going to be 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.250
 transportation to three companies 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.560
 when we have knowledge 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.340
 that the company that provides the service 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.040
 urban transport with nothing more brainy and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.290
 there they mentioned three companies all of us 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.910
 we worry because we want to know 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.440
 who is giving them that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.260
 concession that supposedly between 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.300
 quotes and who operated this 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.550
 manifestation is due to the trucks 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.950
 new ones that come in sir 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:38.810
 I do not think that these trucks do not come 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:43.240
 enter because they are violating the routes 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.240
 are getting into unauthorized routes 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.380
 and violating the roads so you are not 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.450
 are adding the routes to those that already 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.230
 is both then they are outside the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.630
 legal framework 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.970
 although it is true that the town hall 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.850
 approve the route designs and all that 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.670
 but you can approve them but without 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.260
 harm the already established and now 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.570
 as for the improvement we 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.680
 we are in favor of getting better at 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.880
 transport 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.710
 we are in favor of 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.630
 modernization since we are 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.200
 changing units to improve the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 transport now on the other hand have the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.910
 pretext that they will give the service to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.800
 people with disabilities and the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.410
 groupings and established we have more 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.260
 of 60 years rendering the service to all 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.170
 those people of vulnerable with disabilities 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 now they are mentioning and doing 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.290
 an advertisement that they will give you the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.210
 service to those people with disabilities 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.870
 when we have a whole life 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.880
 giving him the service, so that we 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.320
 we have given and we give 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.380
 continue to give service to those people 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.350
 with a disability that I mentioned 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.020
 but if in the precious trucks I do not see 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.460
 that have ramp I do not see that trucks 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.080
 modern says the president 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.120
 municipal give them support from you 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.210
 to scare the trucks in two 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.310
 years have not done anything 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.150
 the sir units before were units 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.660
 that they were chickens were 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.760
 combi now we have a minibuses and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.540
 also with the same support that you gave them 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.450
 Part of that he has renewed itself 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.420
 vehicular park with the credit that she 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.680
 same gave the transporters they 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.260
 They renovated 53 units and apart with 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.490
 own resources of those of the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.430
 dealerships were renewed 37 you 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.160
 they feel that they are taking the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.890
 sure not what it is that we feel is 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.180
 that would not be real or routes to anyone 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.370
 because we have agreements with the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.070
 president that has to be with the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.870
 consensus of all groupings and 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.770
 there is also a procedure and what 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.770
 have to respect 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:10.629
 in a nutshell 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.159
 there is respect for the law and that's what 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.109
 we know why we want the 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.780
 report the truth to the citizenship brick 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.820
 because we believe in you and you 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.389
 we read you understand me and how nice 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.100
 good that there are many people just like you 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.300
 we are not against we want it to be 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.300
 modernize transportation 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.949
 look what happens is this in reality 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.070
 there is a law for the disabled that 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.260
 it's a dead law from over 20 years ago 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:48.760
 where the government does not want to give 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.190
 advice neither housing nor work nor anything 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.440
 to the disabled and it's a way to 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.199
 want to force transporters to 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.169
 if you have to give this service to 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.300
 the disabled when it's a 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.220
 obligation of the state government 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.530
 the pre will serve not your approval 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.889
 We carriers for more than 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.280
 50 years 60 we have been giving him 50 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.590
 hundred who paid the subsidy to 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.720
 all those people are our own 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.629
 transporters the government does not give anything 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.889
 the disabled wants to use 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:25.720
 only to the people and to to put 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.090
 those units wants to justify with a 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.430
 ramp that is not functional because it 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.440
 have to lower the driver to go up 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.340
 person and that we have already done 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.550
 we already have their dining room and a 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.710
 tablita down to write to me in 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.289
 the transportation law does not say that these 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.750
 units should have ramps and if you 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.389
 goes to the interior of the mexico district 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.009
 federal government and check the buses that 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.919
 they provide service to see if it is on ramp 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.930
 they are not going to leave a photo the law says that 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.840
 it must be for 42 passengers and the 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.759
 transport is talking about 100 and there's 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.020
 insurance for 100 in urban transport 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:07.050
 how will not travel insurance 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.060
 of travelers when the insurance they 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.940
 pay is minimal here all cities 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.199
 they have insurance for damages to third parties 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:20.240
 decrease that is being reported 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.240
 moving the pattern away from the urban report
