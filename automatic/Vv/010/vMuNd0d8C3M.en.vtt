00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 today almost everyone owns roger ps 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.360
 but did you know that at gosling there is a small public limited company that 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.240
 designs manufactures and sells gps very sharp and especially very 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.919
 appreciated by professionals 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.079
 he bikers 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.130
 we do not have a system 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.160
 the vision that we all know the properties that are performing very well 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.079
 very good machine 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.789
 nevertheless when one speaks to some extreme driving conditions 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 as are those of the motorcycle 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.499
 even if it's motorcycle recreation 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:31.649
 well the main thing is that the pilot can keep 100% his intention we have 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.460
 so developed a system that allows precisely 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 - attention possible thanks to the navigation system 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.480
 with all the tension of the pilot calm yourself piloting 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
 t was originally developed by title for bikers the aircraft gets 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.640
 wants simple to used 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 the military securing for the users of two wheels 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.220
 to these one more this one is a real technical rebound which does not 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.640
 especially do not want to take you as soon as possible in a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.970
 point bar to a point b 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.110
 they do not have the force of shouting that this power really choose the route 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.150
 so they can say sorting then that's when the route counts more 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 that the destination on the other hand with a gps or even taste gourmand who can 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.530
 to do a few times a few kilometers in France I think a very 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 specific 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.700
 carefully choosing 64 mountain passes 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.100
 and then it's a whole week of vacation where they always go for 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.700
 go down as if I were a black track gigs and parties ever before the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 end 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.190
 then only two critical strengths 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.060
 the other is another way of displaying the data 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260
 posters both its comoros rebound as has always been done in 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.050
 rally because if we did it like that for twenty or thirty years 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.350
 it's the most visible way 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.330
 agostini the company employs 5 full-time people a dozen 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.490
 technicians developers a little more episodic 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.700
 the product more time for everyone first of all even though his role at my 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.869
 motorcycle dealer 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.220
 and props actually it's still a problem 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.110
 munich led and we are in phase of development hens so we have 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.890
 essentially between distributed on belgium now we are in the process of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 September in France 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.249
 in Holland very slowly yes ok and Germany can be said that their camp 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.109
 rc to 700 pieces 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.809
 of the year was going on 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.299
 for in China made about 410 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.389
 my teammates is not just a leisure tool the company has 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.239
 also a fleet of machines for rental 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.510
 for prestigious event organizers another way to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 use the product for the set in control 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.340
 which is where the machine can be used to check that their 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.099
 competing 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.719
 and passed well to the obligatory passage point that did not erase except the 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.159
 authorized speeds in villages 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.870
 for the stopwatch is also in everything regards the palm of 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.939
 regularity 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.189
 the dakar is the biggest customer to leave for rent but there are others 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.070
 trust the Walloon society 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.069
 as for example the organizers of the Tour de France or that only 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.999
 of regularity rally such as light ice cream 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.049
 and then at the beginning of the year but m l'africa remains a new rally raid 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.159
 between Marseille and the map to trace the evidence the organizers are counting 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.499
 use among others 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:09.909
 for patrick 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.189
 a huge narrow advantage on the terrace near naples 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:14.310
 they are stressed 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.079
 as to the precision of the distance during the conference 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:17.919
 we saw it born 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.829
 a deployment of a mechanical precision one is formed of precision 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.629
 gps barefoot she quite faradje the central nave with downstream 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.120
 devices compared to each other 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.370
 the eldest of the Pashtun brothers in more details about the content I liked 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.310
 to do constantly in recognition to be certain 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.749
 to have taken notes 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.079
 during the race the road book was simply 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.719
 patrick artus 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:46.299
 the little yellow machine is constantly improving in direct collaboration with the 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.299
 main interested users 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.509
 a tooth in the same body since birth 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:59.239
 as now we work a lot and I'm sure that 2009 has booked some 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.109
 surprises to our users and the new things that will be coming soon 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:02.839
 arrive 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:04.880
 surprises the adventured 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.469
 and beautiful walks 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.309
 motorcycle of course
