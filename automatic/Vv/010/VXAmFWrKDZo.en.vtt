00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 so easy part 2 this is my second etc 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.429
 where it is not really true because 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 The bargain not every day with me 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.639
 that now more junk in that me 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.950
 Just wrap it up when I see the forest 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 go or pack the backpack if I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 longer away from home 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 useful clutter of eating here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.500
 Could that be the standard edc of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 Expedition needs the first bag 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 I bought myself back again 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.869
 Twice your daughter make it easy 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.830
 Side of the bag only the backpack 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 can turn it on 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.250
 and here have a great bandage 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.620
 Scherer was also part of it at the same time 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 Mini sd FÃ¼rst I have the thing until you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.690
 Filmed by simply flexible here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.629
 Have pulled band through 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.700
 these parts and here at the front carefully 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 I'm the needle through the fabric network 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.410
 drawn and above me now since I 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 one more attitude I have 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.920
 as a mini nail iron canons crowbar 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 standing by is very helpful 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.400
 and I have to say so for the biggest one 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.229
 that will give you a lot if 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.729
 you want 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.200
 if ever in or out somewhere 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.540
 I do not want to go in or where you are 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.540
 should therefore get out front 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.830
 There are two more shoes 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 The Trier again a consultation mask 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.070
 like the others , we have 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.000
 here mosquito repellent against stings and 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770
 plaster in it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 These are all things that are also in the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 But other disciplines are you 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 notice that there are many things 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.399
 redundant that is double 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.860
 existing similar form so that each 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.070
 these bags individually covers a lot though 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.729
 she added together 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 a paradigm example of this is, for example 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.450
 the plaster I have no one the dsc 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.189
 narrow pavement 1 and 2 5 centimeters 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.719
 Wide pavement over pavement is what 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.070
 which is used every day for anything 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.080
 you have seen the red cross outside 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.890
 and the white cross 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.970
 Here is also a kind of mini sd evz 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.009
 we have everything we catch 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 this on the right side then what 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.650
 said then we have a lighter here 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.790
 with small ties hair ties de 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.350
 sascha blonde hair 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.020
 that's why i need in hair ties and 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.550
 normal elastic bands both with his 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.210
 You can easily tie up a chain 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:31.020
 then we have two 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.260
 safety pins we do not find the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.150
 alcohol in such a perfume dispenser for 1 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.100
 euro from gm 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.440
 for firing or infecting wilderness 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.000
 Become a sensible big tweezers 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 we have a little another doctor 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.180
 because proper anatomical splitter 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.660
 tweezers tempo in the Bundeswehr Association 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.470
 package then but here a sterile 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.220
 Injection needle mainly splinter 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.310
 somewhere out for example a triangle 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.230
 Cloth Bundeswehr Triangular Scarf Can 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.920
 to do a thousand things than to have 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:14.600
 use water filter sling what too 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:19.190
 always join the pal thousand things 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.400
 and even more pain medical finance 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.930
 then a rescue blanket for either 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.269
 Patients or if you really mean 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.610
 situation is where you direction survival 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.230
 is on the way can then keep warm 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.950
 certainly not the first choice though 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.220
 better than nothing other hand tempos 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.720
 quite simply make a whole nose into the fire 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.440
 clean or if you just stop 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.110
 never forget about buddhism tempus 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.190
 I see videos of my in vienna etc 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.230
 opinion, one of the main 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.610
 clarify things flashlight micro compassion 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.130
 to match 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.460
 Two triple AAA batteries waterproof 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.460
 wrapped 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:12.520
 lÃ¶ssel a small pen one 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.200
 nationally known furniture store then 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.150
 would like to have a small-fire racket here 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.739
 just the plate district then 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.050
 the simple Bundeswehr pocket knife 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.640
 I think most people have one 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.880
 You have to say that a good saw 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.440
 screwdriver is just fine and what i do 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.000
 Personally very much used the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.830
 everyone here if somehow leather 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.830
 edited will make it slightly more often 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:45.310
 then we have a small whetstone that 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:50.830
 victorinox knife two times a meter 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.210
 par chord daily things at least 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.570
 The packaging can be tolerated 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.100
 not a woman then I have him 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.380
 with two I have embezzled two 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.870
 Kabelbinder again a permanent marker 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.120
 This time I 'm just the doctor thin 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.100
 So it's often the same thing 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.850
 every single one of them inside 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.130
 works but cooled slightly 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.690
 then I have here to universal 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.950
 wrench I say 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.150
 also contis bike with me two war 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.150
 I can do it with little ones right away 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.270
 separate and a smaller one 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:32.260
 French it with cooker so must for 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:35.410
 the fuel cell with bad so here 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.440
 But two more guys I'm a smoker 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.880
 I always have enough there then these are not 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.650
 waterproof or so they have then 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.650
 even that serves a room related 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.490
 here we have moist twice 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.810
 toilet paper great as well, the 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:55.630
 hands to clean if you want 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:57.400
 Finland had the car and two more 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.950
 things of Valais roland given time 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.550
 get free once that's one 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.220
 insect protection and once universal oil 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.810
 and what gave serious encountered 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.250
 get the torments but they so the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.260
 Insect protection works well for us 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.970
 so and here is also such a sloppy 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.729
 20 years came 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.210
 Here we have two garbage bags then 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.530
 again a condom versatile 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.870
 still machinist seam material but with 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.340
 another needle surgical needles 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.990
 are usually innate 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.580
 this is just about more 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.040
 material condition very stately 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.479
 Departures then we have one 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.729
 little bit to the water to 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:41.110
 Not coffee filters and chlorinated tablets 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.900
 normally use water lacks the 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.940
 21 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.030
 but as a backup we still have something to do there 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.810
 recycle water and seconds glue 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.860
 so far so good that you can get the 2 if it is 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.860
 it's about out there
