the<00:07:15.810> first<00:07:15.840> level<00:07:16.680> I<00:07:16.950> think<00:07:19.370> I'm<00:07:20.370> not<00:07:20.639> sure<00:07:20.849> how

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.030 
the first level I think I'm not sure how

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.279 
the first level I think I'm not sure how
long<00:07:21.240> it's<00:07:21.450> going<00:07:21.570> to<00:07:21.630> take<00:07:21.840> to<00:07:21.960> get<00:07:22.080> through

it all and all that jazz but I at least

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.170

wanted<00:07:24.720> to<00:07:24.780> go<00:07:25.440> ahead<00:07:25.650> and<00:07:25.860> finish<00:07:26.190> the<00:07:26.370> arena

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
wanted to go ahead and finish the arena

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.950 
wanted to go ahead and finish the arena
combat<00:07:27.479> area<00:07:28.080> I<00:07:28.320> mean<00:07:29.190> that's<00:07:29.599> that's<00:07:30.599> good

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
combat area I mean that's that's good

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.810

enough<00:07:31.200> with<00:07:31.410> the<00:07:31.500> fucking<00:07:31.680> zombie<00:07:32.280> mode<00:07:32.520> go

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.310 
but I guess that's how it goes and it's
not<00:07:41.700> really<00:07:42.120> that<00:07:42.150> enjoyable<00:07:42.720> either<00:07:43.020> once

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 
you get the higher levels that game

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.480
