here I've got it running on AT&amp;T network
and<00:00:17.100> I'm<00:00:17.190> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> tell<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> little<00:00:17.640> bit

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.939 
and I'm going to tell you a little bit
about<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.240> phone<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> all<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.740> size

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
about this phone first of all the size

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.599 
about this phone first of all the size
which<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.850> completely<00:00:22.609> unintelligible

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
which is just completely unintelligible

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.810 
which is just completely unintelligible
of<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.539> head<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.590> big<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.640> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
of my head it's really big I think it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.820 
of my head it's really big I think it's
a<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.000> awkward<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.660> hold<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.289> my<00:00:28.380> hands

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a little awkward to hold in my hands

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
a little awkward to hold in my hands
mostly<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.609> these<00:00:29.970> edges<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:30.990> are

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
mostly because these edges here are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.889 
mostly because these edges here are
really<00:00:31.830> sharp<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> although<00:00:33.540> there's<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
really sharp so although there's a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.360 
really sharp so although there's a
little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> curve<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.190> back

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
little bit of a curve to the back

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.700 
little bit of a curve to the back
gripping<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> definitely<00:00:36.600> feel<00:00:37.260> besides

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
gripping it I definitely feel besides

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
gripping it I definitely feel besides
when<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.040> holding<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.149> makes<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
when I'm holding it I think it makes it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
when I'm holding it I think it makes it
a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.570> awkward<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.320> trying<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
a little awkward when I'm trying to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.190 
a little awkward when I'm trying to
focus<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> photo<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:42.690> I'm<00:00:42.780> trying<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
focus on a photo and when I'm trying to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560 
focus on a photo and when I'm trying to
type<00:00:43.410> there<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.160> however<00:00:44.430> options<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> here

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
type there are however options in here

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.170 
type there are however options in here
so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> select<00:00:46.320> one<00:00:46.710> handed<00:00:47.039> operation

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
so you can select one handed operation

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.889 
so you can select one handed operation
say<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.239> you're<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> bus<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.840> something

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
say if you're on a bus or something

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
say if you're on a bus or something
holding<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.890> hand<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.460> can

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
holding on with one hand you can

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
holding on with one hand you can
technically<00:00:51.210> use<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> phone<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
technically use the phone and the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
technically use the phone and the
keyboard<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.160> hand<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.120> screen<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
keyboard with one hand the screen has a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.500 
keyboard with one hand the screen has a
720p<00:00:55.559> HD<00:00:56.340> resolution<00:00:57.030> that's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> little

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
720p HD resolution that's a little

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
720p HD resolution that's a little
surprising<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.469> size<00:00:58.680> I'd

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
surprising because for this size I'd

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.689 
surprising because for this size I'd
expect<00:00:59.449> 1080p<00:01:00.449> HD<00:01:01.050> looks<00:01:01.680> bright<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.309> fine

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
expect 1080p HD looks bright and fine

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
expect 1080p HD looks bright and fine
but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> definitely<00:01:03.210> won't<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.780> crisp<00:01:04.199> as

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
but it definitely won't be as crisp as

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
but it definitely won't be as crisp as
may<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:05.129> phones<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> size<00:01:06.439> android

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I really like some of the features I do

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
I really like some of the features I do
like<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.520> default<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.329> you've<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
like the default look you've got a lot

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.870 
like the default look you've got a lot
of<00:01:34.049> tools<00:01:34.350> grouped<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:34.979> folders<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.700> ready

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
of tools grouped into folders all ready

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
of tools grouped into folders all ready
for<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
for you one thing that's a little

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
for you one thing that's a little
surprising<00:01:38.009> though<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> download<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
surprising though is when you download a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
surprising though is when you download a
new<00:01:39.750> app<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.229> populate<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.770> another

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
new app that will populate on another

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
new app that will populate on another
page<00:01:41.310> not<00:01:41.640> below<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.390> not

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
