maybe steelhead fishing to the United
States<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:50.000> it's<00:00:51.000> quite<00:00:51.150> for<00:00:52.019> us<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:53.030> my

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
States so it's quite for us this is my

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.060 
States so it's quite for us this is my
opinion<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> quite<00:00:54.809> an<00:00:54.930> interesting

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
opinion this is quite an interesting

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.579 
opinion this is quite an interesting
concept<00:00:56.119> I<00:00:57.119> mean<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.809> guess<00:00:57.960> guess<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.440> big

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
concept I mean I guess guess the big

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.729 
concept I mean I guess guess the big
question<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> whether<00:00:59.369> being<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> six-piece<00:01:01.049> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
question is whether being a six-piece it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.289 
question is whether being a six-piece it
affects<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.390> action<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.479> the<00:01:03.570> rods<00:01:05.299> my

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
affects the action of the rods my

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
affects the action of the rods my
personal<00:01:06.780> opinion<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.229> whether<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.619> affects

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
personal opinion on whether it affects

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
personal opinion on whether it affects
the<00:01:08.130> action<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.570> rod<00:01:09.750> flex<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.350> nice

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the action is that the rod flex is nice

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.170 
the action is that the rod flex is nice
and<00:01:10.979> smoothly<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> whole<00:01:11.670> way<00:01:11.820> through<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and smoothly the whole way through the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.060 
and smoothly the whole way through the
blank<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> sweep<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> rod<00:01:13.830> round

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
blank when when you sweep the rod round

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
blank when when you sweep the rod round
you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> middle<00:01:14.880> sections<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.510> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you can see the middle sections of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.190 
you can see the middle sections of the
rod<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.710> bending<00:01:17.159> nice<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.640> smoothly

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
rod really bending nice and smoothly

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.490 
rod really bending nice and smoothly
which<00:01:19.200> gives<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.770> caster<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.700> lot<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> feel<00:01:21.500> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
which gives the caster a lot of feel and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.910 
which gives the caster a lot of feel and
makes<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> forward<00:01:23.579> delivery<00:01:23.969> of<00:01:24.179> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you know if used the ride then the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.230 
you know if used the ride then the
fourth<00:01:33.149> piece<00:01:33.329> version<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.170> real<00:01:35.240> medal

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
fourth piece version it's real medal

fourth piece version it's real medal
it's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.979> medium<00:01:37.979> action<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:38.939> medium

Covenant and the sex piece is

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.520 
Covenant and the sex piece is
replicating<00:01:41.999> that<00:01:42.179> pretty<00:01:42.749> much<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> would

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
replicating that pretty much you would

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.160 
replicating that pretty much you would
never<00:01:43.560> know<00:01:43.859> that<00:01:43.920> sex<00:01:44.369> piece<00:01:44.579> ride<00:01:44.789> that's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
never know that sex piece ride that's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
never know that sex piece ride that's
interesting<00:01:46.549> I've<00:01:47.549> been<00:01:47.670> gone<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> days

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
interesting I've been gone of the days

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.999 
interesting I've been gone of the days
when<00:01:48.569> a<00:01:48.899> six<00:01:49.439> piece<00:01:49.710> rod

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
when a six piece rod

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.060 
when a six piece rod
reduce<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.270> feel<00:01:52.750> that<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.500> castor

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
reduce the the feel that the the castor

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.639 
reduce the the feel that the the castor
and<00:01:54.280> therefore<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.909> angler<00:01:55.360> gets<00:01:55.840> from<00:01:56.289> using

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
and therefore the angler gets from using

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.359 
and therefore the angler gets from using
a<00:01:56.829> double-handed<00:01:57.430> rod<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.740> know<00:01:59.770> we've<00:02:00.159> got<00:02:00.340> a

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
a double-handed rod you know we've got a

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.789 
a double-handed rod you know we've got a
rod<00:02:00.579> here<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:00.820> mean<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.799> technology-wise

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
rod here I mean this is technology-wise

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.010 
rod here I mean this is technology-wise
this<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.340> right<00:02:03.549> up<00:02:03.579> there

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
this is right up there

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.910 
this is right up there
it's<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.530> rod<00:02:05.710> with<00:02:05.950> one<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> new<00:02:06.689> nano

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it's the rod with one of the new nano

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.699 
it's the rod with one of the new nano
techno<00:02:08.920> resin<00:02:09.369> technologies<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:11.410> we've

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
techno resin technologies which we've

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.000 
techno resin technologies which we've
seen<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.190> other<00:02:12.580> rod<00:02:12.880> ranges<00:02:13.360> from<00:02:13.450> other

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
seen on other rod ranges from other

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.580 
seen on other rod ranges from other
manufacturers<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.459> know<00:02:15.580> making<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> rods

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
manufacturers you know making the rods

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.130 
manufacturers you know making the rods
very<00:02:17.590> very<00:02:17.830> strong<00:02:18.220> very<00:02:18.910> light<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.630> mean<00:02:19.720> for<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
very very strong very light I mean for a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.570 
very very strong very light I mean for a
traveling<00:02:20.470> angle<00:02:20.799> then<00:02:20.920> that's<00:02:21.190> got<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.549> a

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
traveling angle then that's got to be a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.979 
traveling angle then that's got to be a
bonus<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.269> know<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.510> last<00:02:22.660> thing<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.870> want

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
bonus you know the last thing you want

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.320 
bonus you know the last thing you want
to<00:02:23.019> be<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> worlds<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.730> Russia<00:02:24.970> with<00:02:25.299> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
to be is in the worlds of Russia with a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.030 
to be is in the worlds of Russia with a
snap<00:02:25.690> rod<00:02:26.049> yeah<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.739> mean<00:02:26.950> that's

so to conclude the thirteen first six

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.300 
so to conclude the thirteen first six
four<00:04:35.030> nine<00:04:35.060> Luke<00:04:35.540> Ross<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:36.200> think<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:37.280> of

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
four nine Luke Ross I think because of

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.310 
four nine Luke Ross I think because of
the<00:04:37.550> fact<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.880> six<00:04:38.180> pieces<00:04:38.450> and<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.870> flexes

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
the fact that six pieces and it flexes

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.750 
the fact that six pieces and it flexes
down<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.800> handle<00:04:40.130> it's<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.520> suit

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
down to the handle it's going to suit

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.690 
down to the handle it's going to suit
many<00:04:41.060> anglers<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.830> for<00:04:43.100> that<00:04:43.220> reason<00:04:43.580> I'm

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
many anglers and for that reason I'm

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.500 
many anglers and for that reason I'm
going<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.000> give<00:04:44.150> it<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.510> eight<00:04:44.900> out<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.230> ten<00:04:46.510> just

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
going to give it a eight out of ten just

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.120 
going to give it a eight out of ten just
to<00:04:47.600> conclude<00:04:47.780> this<00:04:48.080> road<00:04:48.680> to<00:04:48.830> me<00:04:48.950> it's<00:04:49.040> going

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
to conclude this road to me it's going

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.920 
to conclude this road to me it's going
to<00:04:49.190> be<00:04:49.250> a<00:04:49.310> real<00:04:49.430> winner<00:04:49.610> sake<00:04:50.360> species<00:04:50.840> are

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
to be a real winner sake species are

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.200 
to be a real winner sake species are
built<00:04:51.080> with<00:04:51.170> trouble<00:04:51.440> engine<00:04:51.800> what's<00:04:51.980> that

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
built with trouble engine what's that

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.300 
built with trouble engine what's that
cast<00:04:53.210> really<00:04:53.390> well<00:04:53.690> or<00:04:54.080> student<00:04:54.530> heads<00:04:54.710> and

cast really well or student heads and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.650 
cast really well or student heads and
spins<00:04:56.090> probably<00:04:56.840> give<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.200> era<00:04:57.380> turn
