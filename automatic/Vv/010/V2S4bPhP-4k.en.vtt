00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.950
 yogurt people i am your partners and 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.599
 welcome to another gta 5 video 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.480
 here on a canal today once more 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.640
 with a terrific easter egg where it 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.789
 yes aliens are extraterrestrial 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.850
 or to be more precise, a sunken one 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.100
 ufo what on the ocean floor of the pacific 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.949
 way up in the north of the map 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.590
 and to find that and go there too 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.090
 There are two in the main 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.160
 possibility to just tell me 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.710
 The first possibility is you buy 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.100
 easy in the docks of the sonata 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.829
 Search service pretty far to the northwest 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.020
 the card that came for $ 250,000 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.730
 buy and then you get one there 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.899
 Opera made available to other 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.219
 possibility is easier if you already 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.680
 played a little further in the story 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.690
 you get hit at hangar in 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.000
 Sandy automatically gets a submarine what 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.890
 stored there is the only thing you 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
 you have to buy it is once the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.960
 cargo bob through the website that it 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 this military helicopter with which one yes 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 things can transport in this 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.970
 hook down underneath and in the year there 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.890
 then simply hooked up the submarine and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.090
 then just fly to the here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.000
 I mark you here 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.500
 just show throws the submarine 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.210
 Just jump off and then just jump 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.130
 best with a parachute afterwards 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.540
 because most of the jumps are in the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.100
 water also deadly therefore prefers to take 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.799
 a parachute and land just safe 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.470
 in the water then simply rises in the clock 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.299
 get in and yes just dive to the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 sea ​​bottom there you will find that 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.439
 Try an ufo for the whole time 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.060
 It would be easy to look at it 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.430
 ascending automatically gives you a dip 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.670
 is and then on and then could be so far 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.130
 I know how to dive down indefinitely 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 The sea is really awesome it is not 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.329
 the only UFO which there are in the game 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.130
 So much is said at this point 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.020
 I do not want to give away so much for 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.409
 the fans themselves on exploration tour yet 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.750

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.210
 or just keep on watching more videos 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.689
 want to wait yes as I said that is 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.790
