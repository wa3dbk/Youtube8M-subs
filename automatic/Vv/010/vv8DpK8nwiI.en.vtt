00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.010 

there's<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> lot<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.029> reasons<00:00:06.359> why<00:00:06.450> certain

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
there's a lot of reasons why certain

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.870 
there's a lot of reasons why certain
areas<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> our<00:00:07.740> lawn<00:00:07.980> can<00:00:08.280> turn<00:00:08.550> brown<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
areas of our lawn can turn brown and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.030 
areas of our lawn can turn brown and
turn<00:00:09.389> yellow<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.080> just<00:00:10.590> not<00:00:10.800> look<00:00:11.010> very

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
turn yellow and and just not look very

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.490 
turn yellow and and just not look very
good<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.639> there's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> easy<00:00:12.599> way<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> diagnose

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
good and there's a easy way to diagnose

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.709 
good and there's a easy way to diagnose
it<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.920> find<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.700> exactly<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> problem

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
it and find out what exactly the problem

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.580 
it and find out what exactly the problem
is<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.080> usually<00:00:16.710> we've<00:00:16.830> got<00:00:17.070> either<00:00:17.820> stress

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
is so usually we've got either stress

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
is so usually we've got either stress
insects<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:20.010> disease<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.180> cause<00:00:21.390> our

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
insects or disease that can cause our

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.269 
insects or disease that can cause our
lawn<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> turn<00:00:22.199> yellow<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.859> yellow

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
lawn to turn yellow and have yellow

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
lawn to turn yellow and have yellow
spots<00:00:23.730> showing<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> lot<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> times<00:00:25.140> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
spots showing up and a lot of times we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.589 
spots showing up and a lot of times we
just<00:00:25.369> assume<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.699> insects<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> we

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
just assume that it's insects and we

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.179 
just assume that it's insects and we
treat<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.080> insects<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> doesn't<00:00:28.890> clear<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
treat for insects and doesn't clear it

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
treat for insects and doesn't clear it
up<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.840> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
up and so what you really have to do is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.350 
up and so what you really have to do is
get<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> dig<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> soil<00:00:32.940> find

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
get up there and dig into the soil find

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.610 
get up there and dig into the soil find
out<00:00:33.450> what's<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.989> check<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> root

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
out what's going on check the root

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.830 
out what's going on check the root
system<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> actually<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
system and actually you know get a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
system and actually you know get a
accurate<00:00:37.590> diagnosis<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.399> what's<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.760> on

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
accurate diagnosis for what's going on

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.000 
accurate diagnosis for what's going on
so<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.620> put<00:00:40.739> my

handy-dandy wonder gloves on got some

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.910 
handy-dandy wonder gloves on got some
really<00:00:44.340> nice<00:00:44.489> gloves<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
easy to work with have good flexibility

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.010 
easy to work with have good flexibility
in<00:00:48.860> dexterity<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.090> I<00:00:50.239> pull<00:00:50.450> out<00:00:50.480> either<00:00:50.780> my

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.819 
pocket knife or a sod cutting tool like
this<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.260> go<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:54.470> one<00:00:54.680> of<00:00:54.770> the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.770 
this and I go to one of the
better-looking<00:00:55.220> spots<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.150> if<00:00:56.239> I'm<00:00:56.390> going<00:00:56.629> to

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
better-looking spots so if I'm going to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.630 
better-looking spots so if I'm going to
someone's<00:00:57.530> home<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:58.010> try<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.309> check<00:00:58.460> their

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
someone's home to try and check their

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.520 
someone's home to try and check their
lawn<00:00:58.820> for<00:00:59.090> problems<00:00:59.570> I'll<00:00:59.960> go<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.199> one<00:01:00.350> of<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
lawn for problems I'll go to one of the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.680 
lawn for problems I'll go to one of the
best<00:01:00.800> spots<00:01:01.100> first<00:01:01.430> not<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.760> damaged<00:01:02.360> area

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
best spots first not the damaged area

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.749 
best spots first not the damaged area
first<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.230> we'll<00:01:03.769> cut<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:03.980> little<00:01:04.220> sample<00:01:04.640> out

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
first and we'll cut a little sample out

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.060 
first and we'll cut a little sample out
so<00:01:04.940> usually<00:01:05.300> I'll<00:01:05.750> take<00:01:05.990> my<00:01:06.170> knife<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.590> I'll

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
so usually I'll take my knife and I'll

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.460 
so usually I'll take my knife and I'll
cut<00:01:07.310> down<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:08.360> know<00:01:08.420> maybe<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.690> six<00:01:09.020> by<00:01:09.200> six

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
cut down in you know maybe a six by six

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.090 
cut down in you know maybe a six by six
inch<00:01:09.710> square<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.350> pull<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.500> piece<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.920> sod

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
inch square and pull that piece of sod

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.060 
inch square and pull that piece of sod
out<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.430> take<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> look<00:01:13.820> at<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.119> as<00:01:14.270> you<00:01:14.360> can<00:01:14.479> see

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
out and take a look at it as you can see

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.410 
out and take a look at it as you can see
this<00:01:16.070> area<00:01:16.280> has<00:01:16.490> been<00:01:16.640> watered<00:01:17.000> fairly

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
this area has been watered fairly

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.719 
this area has been watered fairly
recently<00:01:17.840> probably<00:01:18.289> even<00:01:18.410> if<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:19.190> last<00:01:19.490> night

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
recently probably even if not last night

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.900 
recently probably even if not last night
this<00:01:20.000> morning<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.759> digging<00:01:22.759> into

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
this morning and so this is digging into

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.359 
this morning and so this is digging into
the<00:01:23.060> soil<00:01:23.330> quite<00:01:23.690> easily<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:25.009> should<00:01:25.250> be

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
the soil quite easily and I should be

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.100 
the soil quite easily and I should be
able<00:01:25.430> to<00:01:25.550> pull<00:01:25.759> this<00:01:25.910> sample<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:26.570> without<00:01:26.899> any

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
able to pull this sample up without any

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:37.660 
able to pull this sample up without any
trouble<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:35.830> if<00:01:36.830> we<00:01:36.950> take<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.190> look<00:01:37.340> at<00:01:37.550> that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
trouble so if we take a look at that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.910 
trouble so if we take a look at that
cross-section<00:01:38.050> there's<00:01:39.050> very<00:01:39.380> little<00:01:39.560> fetch

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
cross-section there's very little fetch

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.490 
cross-section there's very little fetch
the<00:01:40.759> soil<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.240> nice<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.690> moist<00:01:41.869> all<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.380> way

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
the soil is nice and moist all the way

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.190 
the soil is nice and moist all the way
down<00:01:42.740> through<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.970> can<00:01:44.179> see<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> root<00:01:44.780> system

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
down through you can see the root system

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.830 
down through you can see the root system
of<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.100> grass<00:01:46.429> down<00:01:47.179> at<00:01:47.479> least<00:01:47.690> three

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
of the of the grass down at least three

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.359 
of the of the grass down at least three
inches<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.560> think<00:01:48.800> it's<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.130> go<00:01:49.220> even

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
inches and I think it's going to go even

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.569 
inches and I think it's going to go even
deeper<00:01:49.520> than<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.100> isn't<00:01:52.430> the

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
deeper than that and so this isn't the

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.120 
deeper than that and so this isn't the
the<00:01:53.090> most<00:01:53.299> beautiful<00:01:53.900> piece<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.140> grass<00:01:54.560> but

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
the most beautiful piece of grass but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.350 
the most beautiful piece of grass but
you<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.369> tell<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:55.729> getting<00:01:55.850> plenty<00:01:56.270> of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
you can tell it's getting plenty of

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200 
you can tell it's getting plenty of
water<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.920> soil<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.310> nice<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.670> soft<00:01:58.939> and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
water and the soil is nice and soft and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.440 
water and the soil is nice and soft and
it<00:01:59.990> falls<00:02:00.799> apart<00:02:01.159> it's<00:02:01.340> not<00:02:01.490> real<00:02:01.759> heavy<00:02:02.030> clay

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it falls apart it's not real heavy clay

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.319 
it falls apart it's not real heavy clay
and<00:02:02.720> we<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.680> see<00:02:03.890> good<00:02:04.100> root<00:02:04.280> system<00:02:04.310> there<00:02:04.909> so

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
and we can see good root system there so

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.380 
and we can see good root system there so
I<00:02:05.390> like<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.600> compare<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.470> good<00:02:07.189> sample<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> bad

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
I like to compare a good sample to a bad

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.009 
I like to compare a good sample to a bad
sample<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.140> we<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.410> something<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:11.019> reference

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
sample so we have something to reference

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.110 
sample so we have something to reference
so<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.680> know<00:02:12.829> what<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.190> grass<00:02:13.430> really<00:02:13.730> should

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
so we know what the grass really should

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.380 
so we know what the grass really should
be<00:02:14.299> looking<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.200> then<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:15.769> can<00:02:15.920> help

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
be looking like and then we can help

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.229 
be looking like and then we can help
hopefully<00:02:17.390> identify<00:02:17.540> what's<00:02:18.079> going<00:02:18.380> on<00:02:18.530> if

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
hopefully identify what's going on if

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.970 
hopefully identify what's going on if
our<00:02:20.239> other<00:02:20.450> sample<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.440> showing<00:02:21.769> some

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
our other sample is showing some

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.289 
our other sample is showing some
different<00:02:22.010> conditions<00:02:22.790> then<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.060> can

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
different conditions then we can

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.390 
different conditions then we can
actually<00:02:23.989> tell<00:02:24.230> whether<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.739> insects<00:02:25.220> or

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
actually tell whether it's insects or

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520 
actually tell whether it's insects or
disease<00:02:25.760> or<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.600> even<00:02:26.720> stress<00:02:27.200> really

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
disease or just even stress really

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.350 
disease or just even stress really
quickly<00:02:27.890> by<00:02:28.040> looking<00:02:28.579> at<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.760> good<00:02:28.940> sample

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
quickly by looking at a good sample

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.240 
quickly by looking at a good sample
first<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.989> then<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.829> taking<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.130> look

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
first and then going and taking a look

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.580 
first and then going and taking a look
at<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> bat<00:02:31.670> sample<00:02:32.120> next<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.019> I'm<00:02:33.260> going<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.470> put

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
at a bat sample next so I'm going to put

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.190 
at a bat sample next so I'm going to put
that<00:02:33.709> piece<00:02:33.769> of<00:02:34.130> sod<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.850> there

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.320 

and<00:02:38.200> we're<00:02:38.410> going<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> move<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.580> location

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
and we're going to move to a location

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.540 
and we're going to move to a location
that's<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.350> good<00:02:41.380> looking<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.070> see<00:02:42.370> if<00:02:42.460> we

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
that's not as good looking and see if we

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.960 
that's not as good looking and see if we
can<00:02:42.670> figure<00:02:42.820> out<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.180> problem<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:47.970> now

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
can figure out what the problem is now

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.820 
can figure out what the problem is now
this<00:02:49.120> spot<00:02:49.330> doesn't<00:02:49.660> look<00:02:49.750> nearly<00:02:50.020> as<00:02:50.200> nice<00:02:50.470> as

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
this spot doesn't look nearly as nice as

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.620 
this spot doesn't look nearly as nice as
the<00:02:51.250> other<00:02:51.280> grass<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.000> we<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.270> looked<00:02:52.510> at

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the other grass that we just looked at

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.410 
the other grass that we just looked at
just<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.960> few<00:02:53.170> feet<00:02:53.410> away<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.300> what<00:02:55.300> we're

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
just a few feet away and what we're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.200 
just a few feet away and what we're
really<00:02:55.600> looking<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.530> if<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.520> soil<00:02:57.790> has

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
really looking for is if the soil has

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.930 
really looking for is if the soil has
the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.890> moisture<00:02:59.890> consistency<00:03:00.670> all<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
the same moisture consistency all the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.850 
the same moisture consistency all the
way<00:03:01.030> through<00:03:01.300> we<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:02.170> area<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.590> getting

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
way through we know this area is getting

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.040 
way through we know this area is getting
plenty<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.190> water<00:03:03.390> we<00:03:04.390> really<00:03:04.600> want<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.840> check

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
plenty of water we really want to check

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.780 
plenty of water we really want to check
and<00:03:05.230> see<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.590> soil<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:05.920> compacted<00:03:06.340> down

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
and see if that soil is compacted down

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.580 
and see if that soil is compacted down
so<00:03:07.060> maybe<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.420> water<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.720> not<00:03:07.840> penetrating<00:03:08.470> in

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
so maybe the water is not penetrating in

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.620 
so maybe the water is not penetrating in
very<00:03:08.830> well<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.280> grass<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.910> very<00:03:10.240> thin

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
very well because the grass is very thin

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.300 
very well because the grass is very thin
through<00:03:10.990> here<00:03:11.230> compared<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.860> last<00:03:12.040> sample

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
through here compared to the last sample

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.220 
through here compared to the last sample
that<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.700> checked<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.210> so<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.900> could<00:03:14.110> be

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
that we checked and so it could be

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.890 
that we checked and so it could be
insects<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:15.280> could<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.700> disease<00:03:16.090> or<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.780> could

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
insects it could be disease or it could

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.140 
insects it could be disease or it could
be<00:03:16.990> just<00:03:17.170> not<00:03:17.350> get<00:03:17.590> enough<00:03:17.830> water<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.490> so

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
be just not get enough water and so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.910 
be just not get enough water and so
we've<00:03:19.360> got<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.570> do<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.170> same<00:03:20.380> thing<00:03:20.710> that<00:03:20.830> we

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
we've got to do the same thing that we

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.640 
we've got to do the same thing that we
did<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.400> our<00:03:21.520> first<00:03:21.580> location<00:03:22.120> here<00:03:22.960> and<00:03:23.080> find

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
did in our first location here and find

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.410 
did in our first location here and find
out<00:03:23.800> what's<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:24.580> we'll<00:03:25.060> cut<00:03:25.240> that

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
out what's going on so we'll cut that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.660 
out what's going on so we'll cut that
same<00:03:25.690> size<00:03:25.990> sample<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.890> soil<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.250> definitely

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
same size sample the soil is definitely

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.390 
same size sample the soil is definitely
harder<00:03:28.090> here<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.500> first<00:03:29.740> spot<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.250> was

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
harder here so in the first spot I was

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.280 
harder here so in the first spot I was
able<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.640> push<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.330> trowel<00:03:31.660> down<00:03:31.960> really

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
able to push the trowel down really

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.860 
able to push the trowel down really
easily<00:03:32.620> into<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.100> soil<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.610> here<00:03:34.330> there's

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
easily into the soil and here there's

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.870 
easily into the soil and here there's
there's<00:03:35.230> moisture<00:03:35.680> that's<00:03:36.280> getting<00:03:36.580> down<00:03:36.730> in

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
there's moisture that's getting down in

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.390 
there's moisture that's getting down in
there<00:03:37.000> but<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.300> much<00:03:37.480> harder<00:03:37.990> soil<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.800> so

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
there but it's a much harder soil and so

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.230 
there but it's a much harder soil and so
it's<00:03:39.580> it's<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.570> lot<00:03:40.780> more<00:03:40.959> compacted<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.240> my

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's it's a lot more compacted and my

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.910 
it's it's a lot more compacted and my
sod<00:03:43.540> knife<00:03:43.810> just<00:03:44.080> doesn't<00:03:44.350> want<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.530> cut<00:03:44.740> down

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
sod knife just doesn't want to cut down

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.190 
sod knife just doesn't want to cut down
into<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.280> soil<00:03:45.550> very<00:03:45.640> well<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> think

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
into the soil very well so I think

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.140 
into the soil very well so I think
that's<00:03:47.380> probably<00:03:47.680> what<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.190> problem<00:03:48.640> is<00:03:48.820> if

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
that's probably what the problem is if

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.420 
that's probably what the problem is if
you're<00:03:49.810> trying<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.170> diagnose<00:03:50.650> for<00:03:50.890> insects

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
you're trying to diagnose for insects

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.310 
you're trying to diagnose for insects
what<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.150> would<00:03:52.300> find<00:03:52.330> when<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:52.930> pull<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
what we would find when we pull that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.770 
what we would find when we pull that
sample<00:03:53.860> back<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.340> we'd<00:03:54.880> find<00:03:55.150> little<00:03:55.390> insects

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
sample back is we'd find little insects

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.900 
sample back is we'd find little insects
in<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.110> nibbling<00:03:56.440> away<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.740> white<00:03:57.640> grubs

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
in there nibbling away so white grubs

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.090 
in there nibbling away so white grubs
look<00:03:58.240> look<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.990> like<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.350> on<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.740> on<00:03:59.920> the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
look look just like this on the on the

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.250 
look look just like this on the on the
back<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.520> grub<00:04:00.760> free<00:04:01.030> zone<00:04:01.300> white<00:04:02.020> grubs

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
back of the grub free zone white grubs

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.140 
back of the grub free zone white grubs
are<00:04:02.500> probably<00:04:02.860> about<00:04:03.040> an<00:04:03.280> inch<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.820> an<00:04:04.000> inch

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
are probably about an inch to an inch

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.270 
are probably about an inch to an inch
and<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> half<00:04:04.360> long<00:04:04.840> they've<00:04:05.500> got<00:04:05.770> three<00:04:06.130> legs

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
and a half long they've got three legs

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.620 
and a half long they've got three legs
on<00:04:06.489> both<00:04:06.670> sides<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.090> their<00:04:07.209> body<00:04:07.390> they're

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
on both sides of their body they're

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.690 
on both sides of their body they're
white<00:04:07.870> with<00:04:08.110> red<00:04:08.320> heads<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.980> when<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.489> pull<00:04:09.670> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
white with red heads and when you pull a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.699 
white with red heads and when you pull a
sample<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.300> like<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.690> you'll<00:04:11.140> actually<00:04:11.260> find

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
sample up like this you'll actually find

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.430 
sample up like this you'll actually find
them<00:04:11.890> down<00:04:12.070> there<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.520> soil<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:13.840> by

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
them down there in the soil and so by

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.150 
them down there in the soil and so by
cutting<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:15.459> piece<00:04:15.520> of<00:04:15.940> sod<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:17.040> digging<00:04:18.040> it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
cutting this piece of sod and digging it

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.849 
cutting this piece of sod and digging it
up

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
up

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.860 
up
hopefully<00:04:20.759> we<00:04:20.879> can<00:04:20.909> identify<00:04:21.180> what's<00:04:21.780> going

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
hopefully we can identify what's going

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.790 
hopefully we can identify what's going
on<00:04:22.259> with<00:04:22.469> the<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> grass<00:04:23.639> here<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.870> it

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
on with the with the grass here so it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.189 
on with the with the grass here so it
has<00:04:25.860> pretty<00:04:26.219> good<00:04:26.340> root<00:04:26.610> system<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:27.330> they<00:04:27.960> and

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
has pretty good root system and they and

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.920 
has pretty good root system and they and
it<00:04:28.680> doesn't<00:04:29.069> like<00:04:29.400> pull<00:04:29.699> up<00:04:29.879> really<00:04:30.240> easily<00:04:30.629> I

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
it doesn't like pull up really easily I

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.990 
it doesn't like pull up really easily I
had<00:04:31.379> to<00:04:31.500> really<00:04:31.650> cut<00:04:31.949> into<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.729> had<00:04:32.879> to

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
had to really cut into it and I had to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.999 
had to really cut into it and I had to
pry<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.629> get<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.960> come<00:04:34.139> up<00:04:34.199> if<00:04:34.560> you've

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
pry it to get it to come up if you've

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.159 
pry it to get it to come up if you've
had<00:04:35.219> insect<00:04:35.759> damage<00:04:35.969> you<00:04:36.689> would<00:04:36.810> be<00:04:36.930> able<00:04:37.080> to

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
had insect damage you would be able to

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.140 
had insect damage you would be able to
pull<00:04:37.409> that<00:04:37.620> piece<00:04:37.860> out<00:04:38.159> very<00:04:38.550> very<00:04:38.639> easily

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
pull that piece out very very easily

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.959 
pull that piece out very very easily
just<00:04:39.990> as<00:04:40.110> if<00:04:40.289> it<00:04:40.439> were<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.650> piece<00:04:41.129> of<00:04:41.340> new<00:04:41.460> carpet

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969 
just as if it were a piece of new carpet

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.850 
just as if it were a piece of new carpet
that<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.360> laid<00:04:42.569> down<00:04:42.599> there<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.259> by

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
that you just laid down there and by

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.740 
that you just laid down there and by
pulling<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.310> back<00:04:44.580> we'd<00:04:44.849> be<00:04:44.969> able<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.210> be

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
pulling this back we'd be able to be

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.149 
pulling this back we'd be able to be
able<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.960> find<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:46.319> insects<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:46.949> they're

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:47.159 
able to find the insects in they're

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.100 
able to find the insects in they're
nibbling<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:48.120> doing<00:04:48.389> some<00:04:48.599> damage<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.080> we

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
nibbling and doing some damage so we

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.860 
nibbling and doing some damage so we
actually<00:04:49.500> locate<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.400> insects<00:04:50.939> and<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.629> soil

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
actually locate the insects and the soil

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.869 
actually locate the insects and the soil
would<00:04:51.990> come<00:04:52.199> up<00:04:52.349> really<00:04:52.529> easily<00:04:52.979> but<00:04:53.610> since

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
would come up really easily but since

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.999 
would come up really easily but since
the<00:04:54.000> soil<00:04:54.240> didn't<00:04:54.599> come<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:54.990> easily<00:04:55.560> we

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
the soil didn't come up easily we

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.649 
the soil didn't come up easily we
probably<00:04:56.250> don't<00:04:56.400> have<00:04:56.490> any<00:04:56.610> insects<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.419> there

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
probably don't have any insects in there

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.899 
probably don't have any insects in there
and<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.349> then<00:04:58.500> we'd<00:04:58.620> be<00:04:58.740> looking<00:04:58.889> at<00:04:59.219> possibly

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
and so then we'd be looking at possibly

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.119 
and so then we'd be looking at possibly
a<00:04:59.969> moisture<00:05:00.389> problem<00:05:00.449> and<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.500> soil<00:05:01.770> is<00:05:01.860> moist

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
a moisture problem and the soil is moist

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.179 
a moisture problem and the soil is moist
in<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:02.819> probably<00:05:03.659> equally<00:05:04.469> as<00:05:04.560> moist<00:05:04.830> as<00:05:05.069> the

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:05.189 
in here probably equally as moist as the

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.339 
in here probably equally as moist as the
area<00:05:05.490> down<00:05:05.639> there<00:05:05.699> but<00:05:06.330> it's<00:05:06.449> really<00:05:06.509> hard<00:05:07.169> and

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
area down there but it's really hard and

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.959 
area down there but it's really hard and
compacted<00:05:07.919> had<00:05:08.009> a<00:05:08.039> hard<00:05:08.340> time<00:05:08.400> getting<00:05:08.699> down

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
compacted had a hard time getting down

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.510 
compacted had a hard time getting down
into<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.449> so<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.020> may<00:05:10.229> be<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.560> problem<00:05:10.770> the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
into it so that may be the problem the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.769 
into it so that may be the problem the
other<00:05:11.639> problem<00:05:12.029> is<00:05:12.090> we<00:05:12.240> could<00:05:12.419> have<00:05:12.599> a<00:05:12.629> little

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
other problem is we could have a little

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.189 
other problem is we could have a little
bit<00:05:12.990> of<00:05:13.080> a<00:05:13.139> fungus<00:05:13.620> if<00:05:14.490> you've<00:05:14.849> eliminated

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
bit of a fungus if you've eliminated

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.260 
bit of a fungus if you've eliminated
water<00:05:16.199> and<00:05:16.560> you've<00:05:16.680> eliminated<00:05:17.060> insects<00:05:18.060> as

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
water and you've eliminated insects as
