bucket works is that there's a cylinder

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.400 
bucket works is that there's a cylinder
sitting<00:02:21.480> inside<00:02:21.600> here<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.350> see

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
sitting inside here you can kind of see

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.200 
sitting inside here you can kind of see
it<00:02:22.650> right<00:02:22.770> there<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:25.140> just<00:02:26.030> built<00:02:27.030> right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
it right there and it's just built right

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.540 
it right there and it's just built right
into<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> bucket<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.650> bucket<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:28.980> metal

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
into the bucket but the bucket is metal

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.390 
into the bucket but the bucket is metal
I<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> bucket<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:30.720> slot<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:32.220> that's

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
I like the bucket on this slot so that's

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.690 
I like the bucket on this slot so that's
as<00:02:32.580> far<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.030> goes<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> comes<00:02:35.460> all<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
as far as it goes and it comes all the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.930 
as far as it goes and it comes all the
way<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.540> really<00:02:37.080> good<00:02:37.230> function<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.940> all

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
way in so really good function and all

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.400 
way in so really good function and all
the<00:02:39.090> hydraulics<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.780> model<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.170> really

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
the hydraulics on this model it really

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.810 
the hydraulics on this model it really
smells<00:02:40.940> which<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.120> nice<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:46.310> good<00:02:47.310> function<00:02:47.700> on

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
smells which is nice so good function on

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.740 
smells which is nice so good function on
that<00:02:48.290> no-good<00:02:49.290> reach<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.890> everything<00:02:50.750> that's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that no-good reach and everything that's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.330 
that no-good reach and everything that's
as<00:02:51.900> high<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.170> as<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.500> goes<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.010> then<00:02:55.220> with<00:02:56.220> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
as high up as it goes and then with it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.320 
as high up as it goes and then with it
extended<00:02:58.550> that's<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> size<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.000> goes<00:03:00.120> there's

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
extended that's the size it goes there's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.030 
extended that's the size it goes there's
a<00:03:00.390> little<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.810> play<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.920> that's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a little bit of play in it but that's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.190 
a little bit of play in it but that's
just<00:03:02.250> cuz<00:03:02.550> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:03.300> just<00:03:03.420> goes<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.750> Lucis

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
just cuz I think this just goes on Lucis

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.310 
just cuz I think this just goes on Lucis
down<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.100> easy<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.490> fix<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:09.320> digging

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
down here so I'm easy to fix so digging

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.310 
down here so I'm easy to fix so digging
depth<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.850> got<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> crazy<00:03:12.420> digging<00:03:12.810> depth<00:03:13.020> as

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
depth it's got a crazy digging depth as

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.890 
depth it's got a crazy digging depth as
you<00:03:13.950> might<00:03:14.850> guess<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:18.000> that's<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.390> models

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
you might guess so that's the models

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.200 
you might guess so that's the models
digging<00:03:19.830> depth<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.910> tell<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
digging depth and as you can tell the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.840 
digging depth and as you can tell the
boom<00:03:21.420> Ben's<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.870> little<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.670> that's<00:03:23.670> just

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
boom Ben's a little bit that's just

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.340 
boom Ben's a little bit that's just
because<00:03:24.000> there's<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.360> little<00:03:24.540> bit<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> space<00:03:25.080> in

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
because there's a little bit of space in

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.830 
because there's a little bit of space in
between<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.740> section<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.400> section<00:03:27.620> so

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
between this section in this section so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.680 
between this section in this section so
you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.440> big<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:32.150> dozen<00:03:33.150> subtracting<00:03:33.630> them

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
you know go big a dozen subtracting them

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.460 
you know go big a dozen subtracting them
all<00:03:34.400> also<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.060> way<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.210> cylinders<00:03:37.200> work<00:03:37.350> in

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
all also the way the cylinders work in

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.440 
all also the way the cylinders work in
the<00:03:37.530> back<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.220> see<00:03:38.430> there's<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.910> there

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the back here is you see there's a there

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.520 
the back here is you see there's a there
are<00:03:39.540> two<00:03:39.690> cylinders<00:03:41.660> one<00:03:42.660> there<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> one

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
are two cylinders one there and one

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.060 
are two cylinders one there and one
there<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:45.300> when<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:46.500> boom<00:03:46.800> is<00:03:46.950> all

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
there and that when it's the boom is all

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.270 
there and that when it's the boom is all
the<00:03:47.130> way<00:03:47.220> down<00:03:47.460> like<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:49.650> cylinders<00:03:50.130> are

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the way down like so the cylinders are

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.220 
the way down like so the cylinders are
all<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.520> way<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:51.720> it's<00:03:51.960> kind<00:03:52.170> of

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
all the way in and then it's kind of

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.470 
all the way in and then it's kind of
like<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> lover<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.040> fulcrum<00:03:53.430> whereas<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
like a lover and a fulcrum whereas the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.880 
like a lover and a fulcrum whereas the
cylinders<00:03:54.870> come<00:03:55.050> out<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.260> see<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> cylinders

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
cylinders come out you see the cylinders

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.980 
cylinders come out you see the cylinders
are<00:03:55.980> getting<00:03:56.160> pushed<00:03:56.340> out<00:03:56.490> there<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.630> pushes

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
are getting pushed out there it pushes

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.180 
are getting pushed out there it pushes
the<00:03:59.300> boom<00:04:00.300> up<00:04:00.650> see<00:04:01.650> that's<00:04:01.830> where<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.100> a

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
the boom up see that's where it's a

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.520 
the boom up see that's where it's a
straight<00:04:02.610> right<00:04:02.850> there<00:04:03.260> so<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.410> basically

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
straight right there so that's basically

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.190 
straight right there so that's basically
how<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.100> works<00:04:07.610> along<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.790> top<00:04:09.110> there's<00:04:10.110> a

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
how that works along the top there's a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.300 
how that works along the top there's a
lot<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.520> fence<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:13.050> everything<00:04:13.140> I<00:04:13.710> usually

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
lot of fence and everything I usually

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.250 
lot of fence and everything I usually
smoke<00:04:14.400> stack<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.960> air<00:04:16.080> cleaners

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
smoke stack and your air cleaners

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.400 
smoke stack and your air cleaners
actually<00:04:16.950> sits<00:04:17.190> down<00:04:17.370> inside<00:04:17.850> there<00:04:18.410> this

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
actually sits down inside there this

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.800 
actually sits down inside there this
model<00:04:19.620> has<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.859> really<00:04:20.070> nice<00:04:20.220> cast<00:04:20.580> too<00:04:20.910> so

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
model has a really nice cast too so

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.960 
model has a really nice cast too so
there's<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.530> lot<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.490> know<00:04:23.520> good

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
there's just a lot of you know good

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.480 
there's just a lot of you know good
detail<00:04:24.330> here's<00:04:24.660> your<00:04:24.810> radiator<00:04:25.490> also

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
detail here's your radiator also

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.660 
detail here's your radiator also
something<00:04:26.700> about<00:04:26.820> this<00:04:27.120> is

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
something about this is

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.760 
something about this is
this<00:04:28.330> obviously<00:04:28.540> this<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.140> an<00:04:29.260> older<00:04:29.530> style

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
this obviously this is an older style

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.930 
this obviously this is an older style
machine<00:04:30.220> which<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.730> like<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:32.670> they<00:04:33.670> used<00:04:33.850> to

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
machine which I like and they used to

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.680 
machine which I like and they used to
make<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.660> cabs<00:04:34.870> on<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.140> right<00:04:35.380> but<00:04:36.510> like<00:04:37.510> this

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
make the cabs on the right but like this

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.820 
make the cabs on the right but like this

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
it's actually fairly skinny which I kind

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.000 
it's actually fairly skinny which I kind
of<00:05:16.570> like<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.960> it's<00:05:17.050> long<00:05:17.290> which<00:05:17.560> I<00:05:17.680> like<00:05:17.860> as

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
well as love space behind the operator

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.460 
well as love space behind the operator
so<00:05:23.670> here's<00:05:24.670> your<00:05:24.760> counter<00:05:25.030> weight<00:05:25.230> with<00:05:26.230> two

counterweight but you know this boom is

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.690 
counterweight but you know this boom is
hollow<00:05:33.280> so<00:05:33.670> just<00:05:34.480> need<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.720> lot<00:05:35.190> no<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.220> mean<00:05:36.400> and

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
hollow so just need a lot no I mean and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.210 
hollow so just need a lot no I mean and
you<00:05:36.880> can't<00:05:37.060> really<00:05:37.150> tell<00:05:37.480> but<00:05:38.200> the<00:05:38.350> bucket<00:05:38.710> the

I<00:05:53.320> could<00:05:53.560> take<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.740> link<00:05:53.980> out<00:05:54.070> probably<00:05:54.310> if<00:05:54.520> I

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
I could take a link out probably if I

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.040 
I could take a link out probably if I
want<00:05:54.730> to<00:05:54.790> do<00:05:54.880> but<00:05:55.150> you<00:05:55.540> know<00:05:55.660> I<00:05:55.690> don't<00:05:55.780> need<00:05:55.930> to
