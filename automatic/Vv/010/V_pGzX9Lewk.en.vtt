right here actually interestingly right
in<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.340> UNH<00:00:02.700> logo<00:00:03.449> we<00:00:03.629> see<00:00:03.870> signs<00:00:04.230> of<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:05.069> so

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
in the UNH logo we see signs of you so

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.430 
in the UNH logo we see signs of you so
these<00:00:05.609> plug<00:00:05.879> holes<00:00:06.150> here<00:00:06.540> are<00:00:07.020> occupied<00:00:07.410> by

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
these plug holes here are occupied by

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.799 
these plug holes here are occupied by
trapped<00:00:07.890> nesting<00:00:08.220> bees

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
trapped nesting bees

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.360 
trapped nesting bees
I've<00:00:09.809> read<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.290> bee<00:00:10.620> hotels<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.190> past

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I've read about bee hotels in the past

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.440 
I've read about bee hotels in the past
and<00:00:11.550> I've<00:00:11.639> always<00:00:11.730> wanted<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.059> make<00:00:12.240> one

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and I've always wanted to make one

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.410 
and I've always wanted to make one
they're<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> nice<00:00:13.290> way<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> increase<00:00:14.940> habitat

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
they're a nice way to increase habitat

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.930 
they're a nice way to increase habitat
for<00:00:15.870> native<00:00:16.170> pollinators<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.190> me<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.550> Kathy

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
for native pollinators so me and Kathy

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.150 
for native pollinators so me and Kathy
nail<00:00:18.150> she's<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.990> Cooperative<00:00:19.380> Extension<00:00:19.470> came

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
nail she's in Cooperative Extension came

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.580 
nail she's in Cooperative Extension came
together<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.850> built<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.080> mostly

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
together and built this out of mostly

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.590 
together and built this out of mostly
found<00:00:22.680> materials<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.820> assume<00:00:24.060> thousands

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
found materials we can assume thousands

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480 
found materials we can assume thousands
of<00:00:24.689> these<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:25.080> live<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.410> there<00:00:25.560> every<00:00:25.980> hole<00:00:26.160> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of these can live in there every hole is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
of these can live in there every hole is
habitat<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.119> something<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:27.779> thousands

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
habitat for something we have thousands

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.620 
habitat for something we have thousands
of<00:00:28.410> sticks<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.890> drill<00:00:29.429> holes<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.000> crevices

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
of sticks and drill holes and crevices

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
of sticks and drill holes and crevices
so<00:00:31.040> they<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.219> find<00:00:32.399> ups<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> crannies<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so they can find ups and crannies that

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.959 
so they can find ups and crannies that
we<00:00:33.270> can't<00:00:33.450> even<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.770> there's<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> national

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
we can't even see so there's a national

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.160 
we can't even see so there's a national
and<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> global<00:00:36.510> concern<00:00:36.930> for

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
and really a global concern for

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
and really a global concern for
pollinators<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.890> decline<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.450> they

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
pollinators in decline we know that they

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
pollinators in decline we know that they
provided<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.530> 2<00:00:40.680> billion<00:00:40.890> dollar-a-year

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
provided like 2 billion dollar-a-year

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
provided like 2 billion dollar-a-year
pollination<00:00:42.329> service<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.020> all<00:00:43.079> agriculture

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
pollination service for all agriculture

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.369 
pollination service for all agriculture
crops<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> pollinators

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
crops so if we don't have pollinators

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
crops so if we don't have pollinators
really<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.309> national<00:00:48.300> food<00:00:48.390> supply<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.750> also

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
really the national food supply is also

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430 
really the national food supply is also
at<00:00:49.200> risk<00:00:49.850> we're<00:00:50.850> looking<00:00:51.210> at<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.809> natural

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
at risk we're looking at the natural

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.750 
at risk we're looking at the natural
habits<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.949> bees<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.370> we're<00:00:53.489> looking<00:00:53.670> at

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
habits of bees so we're looking at

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.119 
habits of bees so we're looking at
meadow<00:00:53.910> sites<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.140> organic<00:00:55.710> farms<00:00:55.980> like

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
meadow sites kind of organic farms like

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.500 
meadow sites kind of organic farms like
here<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.370> Woodman<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.300> also

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
here at Woodman and then also

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
here at Woodman and then also
conventional<00:00:58.320> farming<00:00:58.559> practices<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.190> some

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
conventional farming practices at some

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.950 
conventional farming practices at some
of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> other<00:00:59.750> agriculture<00:01:00.750> Experiment

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
of the other agriculture Experiment

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
of the other agriculture Experiment
Station<00:01:01.469> farms<00:01:01.859> where<00:01:02.190> they<00:01:02.309> use<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
Station farms where they use some of the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
Station farms where they use some of the
pesticides<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> then<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> endocrine<00:01:04.049> oeid

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pesticides and then the endocrine oeid

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
pesticides and then the endocrine oeid
which<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> prime<00:01:05.339> target<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.760> some<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
which are the prime target for some of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
which are the prime target for some of
the<00:01:06.479> bee<00:01:06.600> declines<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.890> grad<00:01:08.070> students<00:01:08.460> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the bee declines the grad students are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.950 
the bee declines the grad students are
doing<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> behavioral<00:01:09.600> work<00:01:09.750> right

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
doing more of the behavioral work right

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.359 
doing more of the behavioral work right
now<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> undergrads<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.189> really

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
now but the undergrads are really

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.090 
now but the undergrads are really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.219 
you think Oh black and yellow there's so
many<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.470> many<00:01:34.770> types<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.250> bees<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.020> many

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
many so many types of bees and so many

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.420 
many so many types of bees and so many
different<00:01:37.560> colors<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.280> particular

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
different colors but in particular

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.999 
different colors but in particular
bright<00:01:39.210> bright<00:01:39.570> green<00:01:39.960> metallic<00:01:40.320> bees<00:01:40.710> which

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
bright bright green metallic bees which

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.389 
bright bright green metallic bees which
I<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:41.400> no<00:01:41.579> idea<00:01:41.759> existed<00:01:43.040> group<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.159> study

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
I had no idea existed group we study

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.190 
I had no idea existed group we study
mostly<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> small<00:01:45.329> carpenter<00:01:45.720> bee<00:01:45.840> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
mostly are the small carpenter bee and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
mostly are the small carpenter bee and
it's<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> genus<00:01:46.770> Sarah<00:01:46.950> Tina<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.000> they

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it's the genus Sarah Tina and so they

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.399 
it's the genus Sarah Tina and so they
all<00:01:48.210> live<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> dead<00:01:48.780> broken<00:01:49.110> sticks

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
all live in all the dead broken sticks

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.160 
all live in all the dead broken sticks
the<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.070> bees<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.060> trap<00:01:51.689> nesting<00:01:52.020> bees

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the other bees are the trap nesting bees

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
the other bees are the trap nesting bees
or<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.619> mega<00:01:53.009> Kyle<00:01:53.220> appease<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.790> lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
or the mega Kyle appease a lot of the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.160 
or the mega Kyle appease a lot of the
work<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.390> doing<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.659> summer<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
work we're doing this summer is just to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
work we're doing this summer is just to
establish<00:01:55.290> what<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> native<00:01:56.520> beef<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
establish what is the native beef and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.630 
establish what is the native beef and
what<00:01:57.420> species<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.680> compared<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> other

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
what species are here compared to other

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.719 
what species are here compared to other
states<00:02:00.110> native<00:02:01.110> bees<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> sting<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
states native bees have a sting the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280 
states native bees have a sting the
ovipositor<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.659> female<00:02:03.930> reproductive

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
ovipositor is the female reproductive

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.649 
ovipositor is the female reproductive
organs<00:02:04.680> all<00:02:04.920> females<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> sting<00:02:05.939> but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
organs all females have a sting but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
organs all females have a sting but
native<00:02:07.110> bees<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.409> largely<00:02:07.680> solitary<00:02:07.920> or<00:02:08.459> very

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
native bees are largely solitary or very

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
native bees are largely solitary or very
weakly<00:02:08.910> social<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:09.869> form<00:02:10.080> very

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
weakly social so they don't form very

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.090 
weakly social so they don't form very
large<00:02:10.530> group

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
large group

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.370 
large group
and<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.600> they<00:02:12.870> if<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> leave<00:02:13.290> them

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and so really they if you leave them

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.110 
and so really they if you leave them
alone<00:02:13.530> there<00:02:13.860> they're<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.250> aggressive<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
alone there they're not aggressive and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.360 
alone there they're not aggressive and
so<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.440> ten<00:02:16.710> years<00:02:16.860> I've<00:02:17.040> been<00:02:17.130> stung

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
so I think in ten years I've been stung

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.050 
so I think in ten years I've been stung
once<00:02:17.550> by<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.540> probably<00:02:18.690> deserved<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
once by them and I probably deserved it

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.520 
once by them and I probably deserved it
so<00:02:21.060> increasing<00:02:21.480> potential<00:02:21.990> habitat<00:02:22.380> will

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
so increasing potential habitat will

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.170 
so increasing potential habitat will
only<00:02:22.680> increase<00:02:22.980> pollinator<00:02:23.970> populations

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
only increase pollinator populations

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.660 
only increase pollinator populations
they're<00:02:25.140> hoping<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.400> we

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
they're hoping this is just one and we

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.280 
they're hoping this is just one and we
hope<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.820> set<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.090> many<00:02:27.240> more<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.720> inspire

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
hope to set up many more and inspire

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.870 
hope to set up many more and inspire
people<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.650> also<00:02:28.920> set<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.220> their<00:02:29.430> own<00:02:29.460> any

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
people to also set up their own any

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.610 
people to also set up their own any
person<00:02:30.270> could<00:02:30.390> put<00:02:30.570> any<00:02:30.930> scale<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.500> in

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
person could put any scale of this in

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.870 
person could put any scale of this in
their<00:02:31.740> own<00:02:31.830> backyard<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.520> increase

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
their own backyard and increase

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880 
their own backyard and increase
pollinators<00:02:33.330> for<00:02:33.690> their<00:02:34.170> own<00:02:34.260> gardens<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
pollinators for their own gardens and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.000 
pollinators for their own gardens and
their<00:02:34.980> own<00:02:35.100> kind<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.550> green<00:02:35.730> spaces
