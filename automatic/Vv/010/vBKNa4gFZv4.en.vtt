00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.380 
it is three stats higher which is odd
just<00:02:21.090> my<00:02:21.510> personal<00:02:21.900> opinion<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:24.180> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
just my personal opinion and then you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.610 
just my personal opinion and then you
have<00:02:25.159> 96<00:02:26.159> play<00:02:26.519> action<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.569> 94<00:02:28.140> elusiveness

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
have 96 play action and 94 elusiveness

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.740 
have 96 play action and 94 elusiveness
so<00:02:28.980> 90<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.060> speed<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.670> 94<00:02:32.670> elusiveness<00:02:33.209> he's

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so 90 for speed and 94 elusiveness he's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.119 
so 90 for speed and 94 elusiveness he's
going<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.049> be<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.470> good<00:02:34.680> scrambling

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
going to be a good scrambling

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.039 
going to be a good scrambling
quarterback<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.970> console<00:02:36.390> maybe<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.930> as

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
quarterback on the console maybe not as

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:43.000 
quarterback on the console maybe not as
much<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.980> Mad<00:02:38.190> mobile<00:02:38.640> because<00:02:38.790> I'm<00:02:39.470> yeah<00:02:40.470> he

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.890 

not<00:02:44.010> he<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.489> man<00:02:44.970> mobile<00:02:45.360> doesn't<00:02:45.780> really

not he but man mobile doesn't really

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.780 
not he but man mobile doesn't really
allow<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.680> do<00:02:46.799> much<00:02:47.040> scrambling<00:02:47.549> with<00:02:47.579> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
allow you to do much scrambling with the
