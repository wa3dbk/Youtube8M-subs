00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.100
 today I'm going to work a set in shades 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.810
 delicate acrylics that I will show you to 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.990
 continuation 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.860
 the way here is going to be like the ones that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.880
 I did earlier that they are forms that 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.650
 we can call razor in Spanish and the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
 difference is going to be that here do not cut the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.529
 triangulito in the center as you can see 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.110
 I want to keep the curvature nothing more 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.780
 the tip is going to be done I want them 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 share this first of easy flow here 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 is the one who is using lately 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.060
 I like that as they see I apply it and not 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.580
 leave residual moisture at the same 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.290
 time that then does a very good job of 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.000
 membership so I recommend it 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.970
 these are the mixtures that I'm going to use 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.470
 of simple because they are mixtures of them 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.390
 for me it's going to be a strong pink 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.730
 translucent with a bit of glitter a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.730
 lilac and a mixture of gliders that prepare 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.560
 I'm going to show you here in a bit 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.560
 of napkin how is it that they look 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.070
 in the previous zetas you 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.649
 the cover of cappuccino nails this time I'm going 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.030
 to use the pitch class that I figure 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.340
 what's more to my skin tone like this 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 that because the load low 6 asked me 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.700
 a lot and I did not mention in the video of the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.369
 nails he was the enea cappuccino and it's a 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.130
 Lovely tone but I like it more as I 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.549
 is going to me this you are seeing here 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 I'm going to form this nail bed like this in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.140
 liquid form we do not have that if you 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.940
 they do not like this kind of way do the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.670
 bed of the regular nail so round 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.100
 and we are going to accommodate the acrylics of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.100
 different ways in each nail 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.560
 not taking advantage here this time he quoted 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.010
 I will clarify a point I have seen in my 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.440
 comments that you notice as well as 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.960
 that my videos are blurred and that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.430
 there are very good shots and this 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.160
 I want to clarify more than anything so that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.110
 know that yes yes I am aware and if 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.600
 I want to improve 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.900
 it's hard for me I have a lot of time 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.300
 doing nails videos I have already three 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.330
 years doing nail videos but yes 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.820
 change my environment change my camera 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.040
 change my tripod is enough to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.800
 that I do not work 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 different way then for example 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.730
 here where they see me because of these my 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.520
 videos because I edit quite a few shots that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.890
 they do not serve me I have a very space 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 limited and sometimes my brush hit the 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.450
 tripiÃ© and it ruins me what I am 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 doing on the nail is very difficult 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.490
 right now my space but I'll try 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.010
 to improve and I will try to make 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.500
 shots are better every day I have improved 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.420
 a lot compared my videos from the beginning 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.520
 but I know that I still need more 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.650
 improve there I'm learning little by little 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.890
 just be important for me to touch 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.660
 this point so that they see that yes yes yes 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.980
 is everything and if I'm working on that and 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.980
 yes i think improve it 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.740
 going back to the set here I'm going to do these 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.840
 little hearts down relief so that 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.050
 can you know when it will be crushed 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.790
 to be able to encapsulate them as you see here and 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.470
 I made them with pink acrylic 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.470
 funny translucent 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020
 for this big heart that I'm going to do 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.450
 next I will use these beads 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.810
 from orillita which are the little pearls 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.750
 they gave me a long time ago here I go to 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.480
 form it is pretty chubby pretty 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.790
 chubby the heart looks good curious 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.710
 because it is translucent over all the light 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.340
 solar attracts attention as well as these 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.850
 little gems that are made of acrylic but 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.490
 for it is this heart and we make it 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.390
 orillita and with black beads are 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.390
 look nice 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.630
 and I added this detail of making a heart 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.110
 in 3d with a pebble in the center 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.290
 down the nail two signs each 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.140
 hand and that has been like a secret in the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.670
 set so it made me curious if they want it 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.030
 do you can also add it is 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.030
 good easy 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.730
 and 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.680
 at the time of applying the gel or tap that is 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.419
 important to remember the pearls 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:27.100
 cover them very well because the pearls 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:29.380
 they are different is something that if it does not protect 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.090
 After a while he'll be confused so 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.320
 I recommend you apply very well there 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.320
 about 23 capita
