00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:11.055
 Welcome to the World of Warcraft patch 6.0 survival guide. 

00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:15.123
 Let's see some of the most important changes 

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:18.844
 of patch 6.0.2: The Iron Tide. 

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:22.831
 To know more about what is happening and why 

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.500
 check the patch notes commented by the developers 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.229
 at worldofwarcraft.com. 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.476
 The first thing you will see when entering the new patch 

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:35.814
 is that we have updated our character models. 

00:00:36.462 --> 00:00:39.508
 Humans, orcs, dwarves, undead 

00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:43.968
 night elves, tauren, gnomes, trolls and draenei 

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.664
 they have experienced a great visual improvement 

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.843
 with higher quality models, fluid animations 

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:53.159
 and more detailed facial customization options. 

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:55.975
 We have tried to improve the characters 

00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.946
 resemble the originals, but if you are not convinced 

00:01:01.106 --> 00:01:05.330
 you can go to the hairdresser and change the hairstyle, accessories 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.838
 And see the new face options! 

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:14.533
 The patch precedes Warlords of Draenor and has pre-release content 

00:01:14.693 --> 00:01:17.196
 to get in contact with the Iron Horde. 

00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.954
 In the Blasted Lands, it begins its invasion 

00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:24.740
 while the Alliance and the Horde take measures to stop it. 

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:29.614
 You can help with level 90 quests and receive special rewards 

00:01:29.774 --> 00:01:33.976
 such as the Estrellita iron mascot or the title of the Iron Vanguard. 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.728
 There is a special version for level 90 

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:40.353
 of the Upper Blackrock Summit dungeon. 

00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.888
 That version and the rewards of the Blasted Lands 

00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:47.300
 will be available until the launch of the expansion 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.093
 So take a look! 

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:53.480
 Maybe the next thing you see is the cut of faculties. 

00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:57.076
 Over time we have added more faculties to each class 

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:01.229
 and we were running out of space in the action bars. 

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:03.930
 With Warlords of Draenor and patch 6.0 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 we have examined the faculties of each specialization in the game 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.252
 and verified that all the spells are interesting and not one more button. 

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.552
 There are exclusive faculties of certain specializations 

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:18.802
 and others have been eliminated. 

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:23.764
 We have also moderated the powers of crowd control 

00:02:23.924 --> 00:02:28.000
 especially in PvP, where it's frustrating to lose control of the character 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.933
 for a long time. 

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:34.863
 Patch 6.0 also includes important changes to the computer. 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.557
 The most significant is the compression of statistics. 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.183
 Each expansion has introduced higher figures 

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:46.678
 both in the equipment and in the healing and damage inflicted or received. 

00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:49.475
 We wanted some more realistic numbers 

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:53.060
 so we've adjusted the team from the previous expansions 

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.487
 so that everything was more reasonable. 

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:59.271
 Therefore, you will see lower numbers on your device 

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:01.726
 and in the amount of damage and healing. 

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.970
 We have reduced the health points, although we have not done it in excess 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.652
 to subtract weight from the damage that can be received 

00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:10.749
 in a short time, especially in PvP. 

00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.609
 Easy: we have compressed the statistics of the creatures 

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:18.424
 so you do not notice any difference when you face them. 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.983
 In addition to this compression, we have added and removed statistics. 

00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:27.257
 We have eliminated hit, expertise, dodge and stop 

00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:30.798
 in the statistics of the objects and we have replaced them 

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.241
 for the armor bonus, the multigoll and the versatility. 

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:38.520
 Multi-hit can inflict damage or heal repeatedly 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.958
 and versatility increases the healing and damage you inflict 

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:44.340
 and reduces the amount of damage received. 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.290
 If you do not know what statistics to choose, go to the spellbook: 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.970
 each specialization has a passive faculty 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.538
 that benefits a secondary statistic. 

00:03:54.738 --> 00:03:59.128
 The armor bonus, a statistic for tanks, reduces the damage received 

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:03.656
 and it only appears in rings, necklaces, layers and beads. 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.384
 Spirit has been replaced in many objects 

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:11.768
 and increased the regeneration of mana and mana by spirit 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.509
 to compensate that you have less in the team. 

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.372
 The points of value and justice have been eliminated 

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:22.607
 and all the points you had have turned to gold. 

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:25.866
 What you used to acquire with courage or justice 

00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:27.918
 now you can buy it with gold 

00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:29.560
 with some exceptions. 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.793
 You can buy improvements of objects 

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:35.180
 with inferior talismans of good fortune, to 50 the improvement. 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.030
 You can get relics by honor points 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.690
 the Black Moon Fair and the Argent Tournament in Corona de Hielo 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.528
 but we have removed the NPCs that sold them for justice points 

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:49.577
 while we work in the collection of relics for a future patch. 

00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:54.828
 One of the new features of the 6.0 patch is the Toy Box. 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.366
 Here the fun objects obtained are saved 

00:04:58.566 --> 00:05:01.129
 as the fliptable table or the repugnant marmot 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.034
 so as not to have to take them in the inventory. 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.498
 To open it, go to "Toy box", in the collections window. 

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:14.457
 Patch 6.0 also includes the option of already created groups 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.744
 that you will see in the group search engine when selecting "Groups already created". 

00:05:19.483 --> 00:05:22.618
 You can create or find a group for almost everything: 

00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:26.430
 missions, dungeons, bands, arenas, battlefields 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.421
 or even a group that does not belong to any of those categories. 

00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.980
 It is useful to find people to play with 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.440
 or access content beyond the search engine. 

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:40.342
 If you like PvP, try the new skirmish option 

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:44.932
 that lets you queue in sands 2c2 and 3c3 without ranges 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.632
 both alone and with friends. 

00:05:48.344 --> 00:05:52.594
 This summarizes the most important features of the 6.0 patch 

00:05:52.922 --> 00:05:54.593
 but there are many more. 

00:05:54.818 --> 00:05:58.654

 with comments from the developers included.

 Thank you very much and see you in Azeroth!
