can see all series there this one this

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
can see all series there this one this
is<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.539> right<00:00:24.869> hand<00:00:25.080> side<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.650> from

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
is the right hand side is the one from

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.000 
is the right hand side is the one from
my<00:00:26.220> previous<00:00:27.260> electrolyzer<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> took

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
my previous electrolyzer which I took

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.189 
my previous electrolyzer which I took
out<00:00:29.340> these<00:00:30.029> containers<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.689> bought<00:00:30.929> pretty

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
out these containers I bought pretty

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
out these containers I bought pretty
cheap<00:00:31.470> they're<00:00:31.650> $10<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.730> found<00:00:33.180> these<00:00:33.300> really

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
cheap they're $10 I found these really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
cheap they're $10 I found these really
easy<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.430> easy<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.790> open<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.719> close<00:00:37.460> easy<00:00:38.460> to

easy and easy to open and close easy to
work<00:00:38.730> with

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

they're<00:00:40.020> acrylic<00:00:41.270> bottom<00:00:42.680> Petsmart<00:00:43.680> than<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
they're acrylic bottom Petsmart than it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.770 
they're acrylic bottom Petsmart than it
was<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.340> looking<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
was and what you're looking at is the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.189 
was and what you're looking at is the
new<00:00:48.989> setup<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.190> theory<00:00:50.960> since<00:00:51.960> I'm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
new setup I have a theory since I'm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.350 
new setup I have a theory since I'm
going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.649> putting<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.219> lot<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.610> amperage

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
going to be putting a lot more amperage

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
going to be putting a lot more amperage
and<00:00:54.660> while<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.620> one's<00:00:55.829> gonna<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:55.980> requiring

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
and while this one's gonna be requiring

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.560 
and while this one's gonna be requiring
a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.760> amperage<00:00:57.000> because<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> bigger

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
a lot more amperage because the bigger

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
a lot more amperage because the bigger
plate<00:00:57.870> turn<00:00:58.020> off<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.399> figured<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:02.039> water<00:01:02.280> in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
plate turn off so I figured the water in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.709 
plate turn off so I figured the water in
here<00:01:02.670> I'm<00:01:02.879> pretty<00:01:03.090> sure<00:01:03.239> he's<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.449> heat<00:01:03.690> up

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
here I'm pretty sure he's gonna heat up

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.920 
here I'm pretty sure he's gonna heat up
so<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.860> had<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> theory<00:01:05.729> behind<00:01:05.970> using<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
so I had a theory behind using the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.710 
so I had a theory behind using the
hydrogen<00:01:07.290> build-up<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> pass

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
hydrogen build-up from this one to pass

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560 
hydrogen build-up from this one to pass
through<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.200> tube<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.030> gas<00:01:12.030> flows

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
through this tube and the gas flows

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
through this tube and the gas flows
through<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> top<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.340> one

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
through there on the top of this one

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.830 
through there on the top of this one
just<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.180> goes<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.780> bubbler<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
just this one goes to my bubbler and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
just this one goes to my bubbler and
takes<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.140> hydrogen<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> oxygen<00:01:20.159> gas<00:01:20.340> from

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
takes the hydrogen and oxygen gas from

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.749 
takes the hydrogen and oxygen gas from
there<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.540> bridge<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:23.040> hoping<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
there the bridge here I'm hoping that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.910 
there the bridge here I'm hoping that
the<00:01:24.240> cooling<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> gas<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.560> flows<00:01:25.890> through

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the cooling of the gas it flows through

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.030 
the cooling of the gas it flows through
the<00:01:26.280> water<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:26.970> help<00:01:27.470> cool<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.710> side<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the water will help cool this side and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
the water will help cool this side and
at<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.369> time<00:01:29.610> try<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> transfer<00:01:30.390> some

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
at the same time try to transfer some

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.890 
at the same time try to transfer some
but<00:01:30.990> some<00:01:31.140> cooling<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.420> side<00:01:33.659> which

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
but some cooling back to this side which

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
but some cooling back to this side which
I<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.799> gonna<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.040> producing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I don't think it's gonna be producing

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149 
I don't think it's gonna be producing
too<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.320> it's<00:01:37.320> all<00:01:37.500> theory<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.950> now

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
too much but it's all theory right now

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.380 
too much but it's all theory right now
I'm<00:01:39.090> looking<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.990> some<00:01:40.200> aquatic<00:01:41.390> temperature

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I'm looking for some aquatic temperature

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
I'm looking for some aquatic temperature
strips<00:01:42.860> or<00:01:43.860> actually<00:01:44.189> yeah<00:01:44.280> yeah<00:01:44.729> pretty<00:01:44.909> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
strips or actually yeah yeah pretty much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.179 
strips or actually yeah yeah pretty much
temperature<00:01:45.390> temperature<00:01:46.020> strips<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> put

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
temperature temperature strips I can put

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.980 
temperature temperature strips I can put
inside<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
inside that way I can see it from the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.630 
inside that way I can see it from the
outside<00:01:49.049> what<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.710> temperature<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.130> inside

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
outside what the temperature is inside

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240 
outside what the temperature is inside
the<00:01:50.790> water<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.229> didn't<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:53.100> any

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the water so I didn't want to use any

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.340 
the water so I didn't want to use any
electronic<00:01:53.700> stuff<00:01:54.119> at<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.540> time<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.200> any

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
electronic stuff at this time to put any

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.709 
electronic stuff at this time to put any
more<00:01:55.470> holes<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> didn't<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> we

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
more holes in it so I didn't want to we

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.039 
more holes in it so I didn't want to we
can<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.560> container<00:01:58.920> itself

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
can be the container itself

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.700 
can be the container itself
that's<00:02:00.770> my<00:02:01.479> setup<00:02:02.479> I'm<00:02:03.170> still<00:02:03.380> working<00:02:03.649> on

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
that's my setup I'm still working on

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.639 
that's my setup I'm still working on
bubbler<00:02:04.070> because<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.310> got<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.520> change<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> from

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
bubbler because I got to change it from

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.259 
bubbler because I got to change it from
from<00:02:06.649> what<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.799> have<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:07.209> configuration<00:02:08.209> to
