00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.500
 and then personally I'm here where one of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 thugs 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.900
 in this video I will show you how to defeat a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.440
 of the special chefs who is my house 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 mana wind then we go to the fight and that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 this next fight the thousand rations stay 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 by launching omb arrows in certain 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.590
 these details do not give much pain then 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.609
 You do not have to worry about having 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.010
 as a fair 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.309
 now you have to worry about 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.110
 give as much damage as possible but you 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 have to pay attention to these crystals 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.719
 that he focuses on during the struggle of these 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.629
 hospitals will start energizing in the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 direction of my cause and they will 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.680
 increasing the damage of my car then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.680
 you have to block these places to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.640
 that you receive a bank of damage to the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 Instead thousand because this bank is here to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.730
 100 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.920
 so if you can get any two 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 crystals at the same time I did there 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 This is ideal because it will be very 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.979
 your damage bank and you 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 will be able to defeat him faster 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 now if you can not block a 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.200
 crystal 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.439
 You have to destroy this one said that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.570
 I was in the car if I did not get booth. 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.979
 So you block all the cops. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.560
 that you can block 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.909
 It is important that you do not leave your 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
 bank breathe 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.600
 the debate in the case can not wait because 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.030
 otherwise you will lose all the highlights 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 and if you are a class that uses 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 helper you will need to move on your 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.850
 handyman moves him in a way 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.570
 that it also blocks 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.720
 the root of crystals because so your 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.409
 Helper also gains the damage the booth 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.020
 that is crucial to win well understands and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.810
 basically this is you block the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 amount of crystals possible 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.220
 leaving your bank inspired and destroys 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.470
 the criteria you can not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.530
 block to prevent it from going 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.300
 music is it is I hope you 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.300
 liked and until the next
