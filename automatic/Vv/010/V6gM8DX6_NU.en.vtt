00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
you've got a lot of weight distribution

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.630 
you've got a lot of weight distribution
that's<00:06:43.110> taken<00:06:43.410> out<00:06:43.560> from<00:06:43.680> that<00:06:43.890> the<00:06:44.430> car

have the pillars down to the the rear

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.670 
have the pillars down to the the rear
deck<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:50.630> that<00:06:51.630> gives<00:06:51.960> the<00:06:52.140> car<00:06:52.290> an<00:06:52.410> extra

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
deck and that gives the car an extra

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.970 
deck and that gives the car an extra
rigidity<00:06:52.800> point<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.810> we<00:06:54.810> then<00:06:55.020> carry<00:06:55.410> some<00:06:55.950> of

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
rigidity point and we then carry some of

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.600 
rigidity point and we then carry some of
the<00:06:56.190> extra<00:06:57.260> supercar<00:06:58.260> version<00:06:58.800> the<00:06:59.220> car<00:06:59.430> has

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
the extra supercar version the car has

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.820 
the extra supercar version the car has
an<00:06:59.760> aluminum<00:07:00.030> flat<00:07:00.690> bottom<00:07:01.140> so<00:07:01.350> it<00:07:01.380> gives<00:07:01.620> the

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
an aluminum flat bottom so it gives the

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.280 
an aluminum flat bottom so it gives the
car<00:07:02.040> of<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.280> very<00:07:02.520> aerodynamic<00:07:03.030> feel<00:07:03.750> so<00:07:04.200> you

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:04.290 
car of the very aerodynamic feel so you

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.510 
car of the very aerodynamic feel so you
don't<00:07:04.470> get<00:07:04.560> a<00:07:04.590> lot<00:07:04.680> of<00:07:04.800> that<00:07:05.010> air<00:07:05.160> that<00:07:05.400> gets

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
don't get a lot of that air that gets

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.770 
don't get a lot of that air that gets
trapped<00:07:05.820> under<00:07:06.060> the<00:07:06.150> car<00:07:06.330> which<00:07:06.600> actually

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
trapped under the car which actually

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.210 
trapped under the car which actually
creates<00:07:07.200> a<00:07:07.230> lot<00:07:07.350> of<00:07:07.410> dragons<00:07:07.800> slows<00:07:08.010> and

creates a lot of dragons slows and

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.710 
creates a lot of dragons slows and
creates<00:07:08.520> some<00:07:08.730> more<00:07:08.880> different<00:07:09.180> noises<00:07:09.360> to
