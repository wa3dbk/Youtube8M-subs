the back I have self adhesive magnets on
the<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:40.859> of<00:00:41.039> each<00:00:41.550> tree<00:00:41.999> on<00:00:42.659> here<00:00:43.139> you<00:00:44.069> will

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the back of each tree on here you will

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
the back of each tree on here you will
also<00:00:44.399> need<00:00:44.670> something<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.499> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
also need something to use for the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.039 
also need something to use for the
counters<00:00:46.979> for<00:00:47.249> your<00:00:47.370> math<00:00:47.579> math<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.299> that

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
counters for your math math and that

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.529 
counters for your math math and that
could<00:00:49.229> be<00:00:49.379> something<00:00:49.620> as<00:00:50.010> easy<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.729> pom-poms

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
could be something as easy as pom-poms

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.439 
could be something as easy as pom-poms
or<00:00:51.929> you<00:00:52.499> can<00:00:52.649> even<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.979> usage<00:00:53.370> metal<00:00:54.149> tray<00:00:54.389> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
or you can even if usage metal tray you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.229 
or you can even if usage metal tray you
can<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.929> pom-poms<00:00:55.859> with<00:00:56.159> magnets<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.999> them

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
can use pom-poms with magnets on them

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
can use pom-poms with magnets on them
you<00:00:57.389> can<00:00:57.510> use<00:00:57.629> pom-poms<00:00:58.139> pony<00:00:58.979> beads<00:00:59.339> i'm

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you can use pom-poms pony beads i'm

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.889 
you can use pom-poms pony beads i'm
using<00:01:00.209> buttons<00:01:00.479> today<00:01:00.959> for<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:02.389> my<00:01:03.389> math<00:01:03.629> man

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
using buttons today for my my math man

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
using buttons today for my my math man
so<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.440> happens<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.610> put<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
so what happens is that you put the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.860 
so what happens is that you put the
number<00:01:07.050> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.680> star<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.750> many

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
number on the star on here make as many

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.470 
number on the star on here make as many
as<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> need<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.640> then<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.850> whatever<00:01:12.000> using

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
as you need and then put whatever using

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.960 
as you need and then put whatever using
photo<00:01:12.660> counters<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.470> bowl<00:01:13.680> lay<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.550> trees

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
photo counters in a bowl lay the trees

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
photo counters in a bowl lay the trees
out<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.960> children<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.410> come<00:01:16.620> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
out and then the children will come and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.890 
out and then the children will come and
put<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> correct<00:01:17.850> number<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.450> counters

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
put the correct number of counters

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.230 
put the correct number of counters
whatever<00:01:19.410> you're<00:01:19.560> using<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:20.100> counters<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
whatever you're using for counters and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.390 
whatever you're using for counters and
the<00:01:21.690> trees<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.260> one<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.710> six<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
the trees this one has six on here and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.250 
the trees this one has six on here and
using<00:01:26.400> these<00:01:26.520> small<00:01:26.850> items<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.450> excellent<00:01:28.170> for

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
using these small items is excellent for

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.110 
using these small items is excellent for
children's<00:01:28.830> fine<00:01:29.130> motor<00:01:29.370> skills<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:30.090> have

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
children's fine motor skills they have

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.960 
children's fine motor skills they have
to<00:01:30.390> pinch<00:01:31.230> and<00:01:31.470> pick<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.830> up<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> guide<00:01:32.790> them

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
to pinch and pick them up and guide them

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.410 
to pinch and pick them up and guide them
over<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.600> tree<00:01:34.550> so<00:01:35.550> we<00:01:35.580> did<00:01:35.790> six<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
over to the tree so we did six on that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.320 
over to the tree so we did six on that
one<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.800> just<00:01:38.250> turn<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.060> but

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
one and then just turn on this one but

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.590 
one and then just turn on this one but
you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.630> go<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.930> high<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:41.220> want<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.570> more

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
you can go as high as you want the more

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.910 
you can go as high as you want the more
items<00:01:43.020> you're<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.560> your<00:01:43.770> going

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
items you're going to put on your going

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.320 
items you're going to put on your going
to<00:01:43.980> want<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.250> find<00:01:44.430> smaller<00:01:44.760> items<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.300> that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
to want to find smaller items so that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.180 
to want to find smaller items so that
will<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:46.040> fit<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.210> your<00:01:48.210> tree<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:49.010> but<00:01:50.010> it's

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
will all fit on your tree here but it's

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.899 
will all fit on your tree here but it's
a<00:01:50.340> hands-on<00:01:50.850> learning<00:01:51.150> activity<00:01:51.830> 3<00:01:52.830> 4<00:01:53.040> 5<00:01:53.280> 6<00:01:53.460> 7<00:01:53.580> 8

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
a hands-on learning activity 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
a hands-on learning activity 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.810> we'll<00:01:55.650> do<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.800> yellow<00:01:56.100> 10

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
9 we one more we'll do a yellow 10

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.000 
9 we one more we'll do a yellow 10
that's<00:01:57.450> right<00:01:57.630> yep<00:01:58.560> 10<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.860> see

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
that's right yep 10 and it's to see

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's right yep 10 and it's to see
simple<00:02:02.340> characters<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> children<00:02:03.270> would
