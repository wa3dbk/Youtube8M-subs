no<00:02:13.230> clean<00:02:13.500> up<00:02:13.620> because<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.130> don't<00:02:14.160> describe

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
no clean up because you don't describe

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.250 
no clean up because you don't describe
it<00:02:14.760> no<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.060> don't<00:02:15.390> scrub<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.080> don't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
it no you don't scrub it and you don't

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.600 
it no you don't scrub it and you don't
clean<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.709> there's<00:02:16.950> nothing<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> clean<00:02:17.490> up

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
clean it up there's nothing to clean up

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.980 
clean it up there's nothing to clean up
because<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.940> apply<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.420> enough<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.900> it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
because you apply just enough that it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.480 
because you apply just enough that it
covers<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> stain<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.709> highlights<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
covers the stain and highlights it the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.580 
covers the stain and highlights it the
microorganisms<00:02:21.180> start<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> take<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.630> hold<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
microorganisms start to take a hold and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.140 
microorganisms start to take a hold and
then<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.130> start<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.400> break<00:02:23.550> down<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> stain

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
then they start to break down the stain

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.800 
then they start to break down the stain
so<00:02:24.630> basically<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.610> 15<00:02:26.610> seconds<00:02:27.060> 20<00:02:27.569> seconds

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so basically it's 15 seconds 20 seconds

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.390 
so basically it's 15 seconds 20 seconds
for<00:02:27.900> an<00:02:27.990> application<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.650> you're<00:02:28.950> done

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
for an application and you're done

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.150 
for an application and you're done
ok<00:02:30.120> let's<00:02:30.360> look<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.020> 15<00:02:31.770> or<00:02:31.890> 20

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
ok let's look at that then 15 or 20

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
ok let's look at that then 15 or 20
seconds<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.480> some<00:02:33.720> video<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
seconds so you have some video here of a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 
seconds so you have some video here of a
big<00:02:35.130> swell<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.849> small<00:02:36.180> stain<00:02:36.480> here<00:02:36.810> okay

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
big swell of a small stain here okay

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.110 
big swell of a small stain here okay
that's<00:02:37.290> an<00:02:37.380> asphalt<00:02:37.709> asphalt<00:02:38.099> so<00:02:38.970> now

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that's an asphalt asphalt so now

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120 
that's an asphalt asphalt so now
obviously<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:40.349> make<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.650> aesthetically

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
obviously to make it aesthetically

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.980 
obviously to make it aesthetically
pleasing<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.790> put<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> coloring<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.569> now

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
pleasing you put a coloring in it now

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.780 
pleasing you put a coloring in it now
that<00:02:43.170> highlights<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:43.920> stain<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.550> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that highlights the stain and that's it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.760 
that highlights the stain and that's it
that's<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.390> let<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.720> sit<00:02:45.810> there<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.410> two

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that's it let it sit there for about two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.949 
that's it let it sit there for about two
days<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.190> say<00:02:47.480> basically<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.750> now<00:02:48.900> that

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
days you say basically so now that

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.750 
days you say basically so now that
that's<00:02:49.230> done<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.860> let<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.130> sit<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.640> it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
that's done you just let that sit and it

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.449 
that's done you just let that sit and it
will<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:52.080> will<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.530> dissipate<00:02:52.950> off<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.310> there

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
will it will just dissipate off of there

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.160 
will it will just dissipate off of there
as<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> breaks<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> stain<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.959> what

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
as it breaks down the stain and what

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.480 
as it breaks down the stain and what
it's<00:02:55.290> doing<00:02:55.380> is<00:02:55.620> its<00:02:55.770> reconditioning<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
it's doing is its reconditioning the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.400 
it's doing is its reconditioning the
concrete<00:02:56.820> or<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> asphalt<00:02:57.450> depending<00:02:57.930> on<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
concrete or the asphalt depending on the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
shot down here at the studio that's just

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.280 
shot down here at the studio that's just
some<00:03:11.550> regular<00:03:11.940> parking<00:03:12.210> stain<00:03:12.600> basically

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
some regular parking stain basically

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.830 
some regular parking stain basically
again<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> apply<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> cleaner<00:03:14.510> take<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> soft

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
again you apply the cleaner take a soft

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.960 
again you apply the cleaner take a soft
bristle<00:03:16.170> broom<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.040> spread<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.550> out<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
bristle broom and you spread it out and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.580 
bristle broom and you spread it out and
if<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.780> notice<00:03:19.020> there<00:03:19.230> how<00:03:19.410> it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
if you notice there how it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.870 
if you notice there how it's
highlighting<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> stained<00:03:20.310> half<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
highlighting the stained half of the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.730 
highlighting the stained half of the
stain<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.270> jet<00:03:21.600> white<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.200> can<00:03:22.350> say<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.710> you

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
stain is jet white you can say it you

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.100 
stain is jet white you can say it you
can<00:03:23.250> directly<00:03:23.610> see<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> stain<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.660> that's

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
can directly see the stain and that's

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.810 
can directly see the stain and that's
that<00:03:25.530> that's<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.860> good<00:03:26.070> sign<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:26.550> what

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
that that's a good sign that's what

square foot pad or better and you see
necessarily<00:03:35.280> how<00:03:35.460> it's<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:35.850> definitely

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
necessarily how it's it's definitely

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.840

cover<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.460> a<00:03:41.490> cleaner<00:03:41.910> because<00:03:42.360> that

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
cover up we have a cleaner because that

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.900 
cover up we have a cleaner because that
is<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.440> microorganisms<00:03:44.100> taking<00:03:44.430> hold<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
is the microorganisms taking hold and

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.240 
is the microorganisms taking hold and
actually<00:03:45.680> creating<00:03:46.680> an<00:03:46.770> exothermic<00:03:46.980> reaction

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
actually creating an exothermic reaction

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.690 
actually creating an exothermic reaction
and<00:03:47.760> working<00:03:48.540> right<00:03:48.720> there<00:03:48.960> okay<00:03:49.710> so<00:03:50.220> now<00:03:50.430> this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
and working right there okay so now this

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.690 
and working right there okay so now this
covers<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.660> stain<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:52.340> when<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> say

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
covers up the stain and when I say

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.270 
covers up the stain and when I say
covers<00:03:54.120> meaning<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.840> cover<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.470> stain<00:03:55.770> with

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
covers meaning you cover the stain with

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880 
covers meaning you cover the stain with
the<00:03:56.430> cleaner<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.540> brush<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.050> on<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.440> then

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
the cleaner and you brush it on and then

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.940 
the cleaner and you brush it on and then
you<00:03:58.920> let<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.250> sit<00:03:59.670> there<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:01.050> first<00:04:01.440> thing

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
you let it sit there and the first thing

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.950 
you let it sit there and the first thing
you<00:04:02.070> get<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.550> a<00:04:02.610> highlight<00:04:03.240> because<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:03.600> you

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
you get is a highlight because if you

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720 
you get is a highlight because if you
have<00:04:04.140> some<00:04:04.350> colouring<00:04:04.770> agents<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.430> it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
have some colouring agents in it it

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.670 
have some colouring agents in it it
highlights<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:07.080> goes<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.410> work

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
highlights it and then goes to work

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.250 
highlights it and then goes to work
beneath<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.670> surface<00:04:08.970> exactly<00:04:09.420> was<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.050> an

before<00:05:14.940> it<00:05:15.030> after<00:05:15.389> yes<00:05:15.750> they<00:05:16.050> stow<00:05:16.380> stains<00:05:16.740> do

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
before it after yes they stow stains do

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.129 
before it after yes they stow stains do
not<00:05:17.190> come<00:05:17.460> back<00:05:17.610> they<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.270> not<00:05:18.509> come<00:05:18.690> back<00:05:18.720> if

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
not come back they do not come back if

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.469 
not come back they do not come back if
the<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:19.440> thicker<00:05:20.039> saturated<00:05:20.669> stains<00:05:20.880> do<00:05:21.150> come

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
the the thicker saturated stains do come

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.200 
the the thicker saturated stains do come
back<00:05:21.690> through<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.139> you<00:05:22.560> maybe<00:05:23.190> yeah<00:05:23.759> second

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
back through it you maybe yeah second

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.790 
back through it you maybe yeah second
application<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.930> that<00:05:25.229> I'll<00:05:25.319> do<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.590> that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
application and that I'll do it that

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.980 
application and that I'll do it that
right<00:05:26.009> there<00:05:26.190> is<00:05:26.340> five<00:05:26.819> gallons<00:05:27.389> of<00:05:27.539> straight

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
right there is five gallons of straight

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.570 
right there is five gallons of straight
oil<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.470> I<00:05:28.560> poured<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.340> see<00:05:29.460> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
oil that I poured you can see the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.820 
oil that I poured you can see the
reflection<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:30.539> i<00:05:30.720> poured<00:05:31.139> directly<00:05:31.319> on

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
reflection right i poured directly on

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.170 
reflection right i poured directly on
the<00:05:31.919> country<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.310> you<00:05:32.370> can<00:05:32.490> see<00:05:32.639> the<00:05:32.759> crack<00:05:33.000> in

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
the country and you can see the crack in

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.760 
the country and you can see the crack in
the<00:05:33.210> concrete<00:05:33.389> so<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.780> can<00:05:33.900> get<00:05:34.080> right<00:05:34.590> you

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
the concrete so you can get right you

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.740 
the concrete so you can get right you
can<00:05:34.949> kind<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.190> get<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:35.759> know<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.910> guideline

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
can kind of get a you know a guideline

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.809 
can kind of get a you know a guideline
there<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.410> can<00:05:37.560> slightly<00:05:37.919> see<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.430> outline

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
there you can slightly see the outline

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.480 
there you can slightly see the outline
of<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:39.720> old<00:05:39.930> oil<00:05:40.169> stain<00:05:40.470> yes<00:05:40.830> basically<00:05:41.280> what

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
of the old oil stain yes basically what

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.360 
of the old oil stain yes basically what
we<00:05:41.610> did<00:05:41.789> applied<00:05:42.449> the<00:05:42.599> cleaner<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.190> now<00:05:44.190> i'm

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
we did applied the cleaner and now i'm

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.770 
we did applied the cleaner and now i'm
that<00:05:44.550> was<00:05:44.789> definitely<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.240> thicker<00:05:45.419> stain<00:05:45.660> we

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
that was definitely a thicker stain we

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.939 
that was definitely a thicker stain we
applied<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.259> cleaner<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:46.590> we<00:05:46.650> had<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.860> apply

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:46.949 
applied the cleaner and we had to apply

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.460 
applied the cleaner and we had to apply
two<00:05:47.490> or<00:05:47.610> three<00:05:47.759> applications<00:05:48.300> but<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:49.320> end

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
two or three applications but the end

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.320 
two or three applications but the end
result<00:05:49.919> there<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:50.460> nothing<00:05:50.880> out<00:05:51.000> there<00:05:51.180> this

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
result there is nothing out there this

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.879 
result there is nothing out there this
is<00:05:51.389> not<00:05:51.660> power<00:05:51.930> washing<00:05:52.470> this<00:05:52.560> is<00:05:52.740> not

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
is not power washing this is not

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.129 
is not power washing this is not
scrubbing<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.729> applying<00:05:54.300> a<00:05:54.630> dry<00:05:54.840> product

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
scrubbing it is applying a dry product

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.320 
scrubbing it is applying a dry product
and<00:05:55.440> leaving<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.979> to<00:05:56.430> do<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.729> work<00:05:56.880> for<00:05:57.120> you

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
and leaving it to do the work for you

and leaving it to do the work for you
can<00:05:57.630> you<00:05:57.750> can<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.229> talk<00:05:58.410> about<00:05:58.470> what's<00:05:58.860> in<00:05:59.009> the

proprietary but you can see some
ingredients<00:06:03.419> um<00:06:03.720> basically<00:06:04.410> just<00:06:05.190> due<00:06:05.310> to

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
ingredients um basically just due to

trade secrets I can't necessarily
describe<00:06:07.220> exactly<00:06:08.220> yeah<00:06:08.669> what's<00:06:08.909> in<00:06:09.030> there

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
describe exactly yeah what's in there

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.060 
describe exactly yeah what's in there
but<00:06:09.659> all<00:06:09.780> in<00:06:09.960> general<00:06:10.380> what's<00:06:10.560> in<00:06:10.710> there<00:06:10.889> and

but all in general what's in there and

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.680 
but all in general what's in there and
generally<00:06:11.550> it's<00:06:11.729> a<00:06:11.880> it's<00:06:12.330> a<00:06:12.419> bunch<00:06:12.599> of

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
generally it's a it's a bunch of

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.680 
generally it's a it's a bunch of
byproducts<00:06:13.650> that<00:06:13.710> house<00:06:14.539> microorganisms<00:06:15.539> and

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
byproducts that house microorganisms and

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.240 
byproducts that house microorganisms and
that's<00:06:15.840> that's<00:06:16.289> the<00:06:16.380> key<00:06:16.560> element<00:06:16.740> about<00:06:17.130> our

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
that's that's the key element about our

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.490 
that's that's the key element about our
product<00:06:17.520> is<00:06:17.639> because<00:06:18.539> of<00:06:18.659> the<00:06:18.750> powder<00:06:18.930> that's

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
product is because of the powder that's

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.899 
product is because of the powder that's
that's<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.430> housing<00:06:20.729> for<00:06:20.820> the

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
that's the housing for the

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:22.070 
that's the housing for the
microorganisms<00:06:21.120> so<00:06:21.539> that<00:06:21.690> allows<00:06:21.930> the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
microorganisms so that allows the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.439 
microorganisms so that allows the
microorganisms<00:06:22.680> to<00:06:22.889> be<00:06:23.070> down<00:06:23.880> in<00:06:24.210> lower

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
microorganisms to be down in lower

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.659 
microorganisms to be down in lower
temperatures<00:06:25.229> negative<00:06:25.979> temperatures<00:06:26.430> and

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
temperatures negative temperatures and

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.399 
temperatures negative temperatures and
basically<00:06:27.419> that<00:06:27.599> just<00:06:27.780> provides<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.229> good

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
basically that just provides a good

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.790 
basically that just provides a good
climate<00:06:29.310> for<00:06:29.520> them<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:30.270> sustain<00:06:30.659> and<00:06:31.080> now<00:06:31.229> when

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
climate for them to sustain and now when

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.969 
climate for them to sustain and now when
they<00:06:31.949> hit<00:06:32.159> the<00:06:32.610> stain<00:06:33.150> what<00:06:33.780> happens<00:06:34.169> is<00:06:34.349> kind

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
they hit the stain what happens is kind

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.140 
they hit the stain what happens is kind
of<00:06:35.039> like<00:06:35.130> we're<00:06:35.280> playing<00:06:35.370> with<00:06:35.580> plaster<00:06:35.880> Paris

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
of like we're playing with plaster Paris

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.879 
of like we're playing with plaster Paris
you<00:06:36.300> know<00:06:36.389> it<00:06:36.719> warms<00:06:37.020> up<00:06:37.139> a<00:06:37.229> little<00:06:37.380> bit<00:06:37.560> yeah

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
you know it warms up a little bit yeah

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:38.810 
you know it warms up a little bit yeah
that's<00:06:38.219> what<00:06:38.400> happens<00:06:38.610> with<00:06:38.759> the

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
that's what happens with the

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.610 
that's what happens with the
microorganisms<00:06:39.509> they<00:06:39.690> start<00:06:40.020> to<00:06:40.139> take<00:06:40.380> and

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
microorganisms they start to take and

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.010 
microorganisms they start to take and
they<00:06:41.009> they<00:06:41.610> work<00:06:41.909> and<00:06:42.180> so<00:06:42.330> they<00:06:42.449> heat<00:06:42.630> up<00:06:42.659> and

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
they they work and so they heat up and

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.930 
they they work and so they heat up and
they<00:06:43.080> they<00:06:43.409> create<00:06:43.830> an<00:06:44.070> exothermic<00:06:44.310> reaction

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
they they create an exothermic reaction

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.360 
they they create an exothermic reaction
and<00:06:45.000> they<00:06:45.120> start<00:06:45.360> working<00:06:45.570> on<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:46.500> stain<00:06:46.830> okay

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
and they start working on the stain okay

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.430
