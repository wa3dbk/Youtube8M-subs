00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
on it's going to start to feel a little

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.379 
on it's going to start to feel a little
bit<00:04:19.650> more<00:04:19.829> like<00:04:19.979> Dragon<00:04:20.310> Ball<00:04:20.459> Z<00:04:20.489> again<00:04:20.940> when

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
bit more like Dragon Ball Z again when

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.000 
bit more like Dragon Ball Z again when
we<00:04:21.479> finally<00:04:21.750> get<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.229> action<00:04:22.680> elements

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
we finally get to the action elements

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.430 
we finally get to the action elements
especially<00:04:23.640> because<00:04:24.060> they're

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
especially because they're

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.260 
especially because they're
going<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.860> some<00:04:25.070> very<00:04:25.310> big<00:04:25.490> surprises<00:04:25.880> down

going to be some very big surprises down

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.910 
going to be some very big surprises down
the<00:04:26.480> pipeline<00:04:26.780> especially<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.620> you've<00:04:27.740> seen

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920

the promotional material and even more

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.300
