00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
it has been an hour that the midnight

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.920 
it has been an hour that the midnight
snow<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:18.660> Walmart<00:02:19.200> has<00:02:19.470> been<00:02:19.800> burning<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
snow from Walmart has been burning and

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.280 
snow from Walmart has been burning and
we<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.200> almost<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:23.220> even<00:02:23.520> wax<00:02:23.910> pool<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.960> not

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
we have almost an even wax pool but not

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.870 
we have almost an even wax pool but not
quite<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.850> can<00:02:27.090> see<00:02:27.540> around<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.260> lip

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
quite if you can see around the lip

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.660 
quite if you can see around the lip
there's<00:02:29.880> still<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.540> little<00:02:30.900> bit<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.890> wax<00:02:32.670> over

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
there's still a little bit of wax over

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.310 
there's still a little bit of wax over
here<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.880> top<00:02:36.870> over<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.840> we're<00:02:40.050> almost

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
here on top over here so we're almost

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.050 
here on top over here so we're almost
out<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.070> full<00:02:41.250> wax<00:02:41.520> pool<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.110> quite<00:02:44.060> I'll

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
out of full wax pool but not quite I'll

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.450 
out of full wax pool but not quite I'll
do<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.720> more<00:02:45.750> update<00:02:46.230> probably<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.430> end

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
do one more update probably at the end

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.530 
do one more update probably at the end
of<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:49.020> night<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
of the night but as you can see on the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.290 
of the night but as you can see on the
wicks<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.370> wicks<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.610> formed<00:02:53.910> mushroom

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
wicks the wicks have formed mushroom

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.530 
wicks the wicks have formed mushroom
tops<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.960> that's<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.740> sign<00:02:56.540> hopefully

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
tops so that's a good sign hopefully

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
tops so that's a good sign hopefully
things<00:02:57.780> will<00:02:57.900> start<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:59.040> know<00:02:59.160> pooling

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
things will start you know pooling

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.420 
things will start you know pooling
together<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:01.470> will<00:03:01.620> get<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> nice<00:03:02.070> even

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
together and we will get a nice even

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.140 
together and we will get a nice even
deep<00:03:03.240> wax<00:03:03.810> pool

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
deep wax pool

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.360 
deep wax pool

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
mean it's pretty much an even wax pool

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.660 
mean it's pretty much an even wax pool
so<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:32.209> will<00:03:33.230> continue<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.950> monitor<00:03:35.190> the

so we will continue to monitor the
candle<00:03:36.150> until<00:03:36.900> late<00:03:37.260> tonight<00:03:37.670> eyes<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.420> it's

similar to bath and Bodyworks everything

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.450 
similar to bath and Bodyworks everything
is<00:04:31.980> kind<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.280> going<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:32.850> know<00:04:33.330> pretty<00:04:33.870> good

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
I'll have to wait and see until I get to

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.770 
I'll have to wait and see until I get to
the<00:04:37.500> absolute<00:04:38.040> bottom<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:39.300> know<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the absolute bottom you know of the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.020 
the absolute bottom you know of the
candle<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:40.500> done<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.370> it's<00:04:41.490> actually

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
candle and it's done but it's actually

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.590 
candle and it's done but it's actually
burning<00:04:42.540> really<00:04:42.930> slow<00:04:43.620> which<00:04:44.310> may<00:04:44.850> guarantee

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
burning really slow which may guarantee

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.510 
burning really slow which may guarantee
that<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:45.960> going<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.230> last<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.980> very<00:04:47.010> very<00:04:47.280> long

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
that it's going to last a very very long
