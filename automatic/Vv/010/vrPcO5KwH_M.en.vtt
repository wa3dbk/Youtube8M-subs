00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.610
 Hi, everyone , welcome to the board at 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.520
 previous we saw what happens with the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.520
 rays refracts data when the beam of light 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.520
 through a medium to the medium 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.009
 more refringente in this class we go 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.400
 discuss what happens with the rays 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.700
 when they cross from the middle to the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.489
 the medium - cooling means the medium 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.430
 higher refractive index for the 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.850
 lower refractive index if I call 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.010
 these media means one and two mail nodes 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 we can write that none that is the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.559
 Refractive index of medium one is lower 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.370
 that n 2 is the refractive index of the medium 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.920
 2 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.769
 in this first situation we will 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.589
 again consider that the angle of 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.519
 incidence is equal to zero degrees or 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:02.239
 the ray strikes the normal line you 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.760
 you may notice that again the radius 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.340
 of refracted light in suffered no 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.820
 deviation from the light ray 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.730
 incident, ie the angle of refraction 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.020
 is also equal to zero degrees 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.940
 in the second case the angle of incidence 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.970
 again can be non-zero 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:27.110
 being we will consider in this 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.560
 first case that is between 90 degrees and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.590
 zero is greater and greater than less than 90 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.560
 degree as ray is passing from a medium 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.620
 higher refractive index for the medium 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.620
 with a lower refractive index than 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.410
 speed will change to the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.130
 speed will increase when the radius 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.800
 past middle 2 into the middle on how the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.580
 speed increases the light beam if 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.340
 away from the normal or in this case the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.410
 angle of refraction will be greater than 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.230
 angle of incidence 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.670
 we can still increase the angle of 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.899
 incidence until it is equal to the angle 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 limit 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.380
 in this case the angle of refraction will be 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.130
 equal to 90 degrees 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.500
 so you can observe 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.440
 is that as the angle increases 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 incidence until it is equal to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.880
 limit angle an angle of refraction 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 increases to the maximum limit of 90 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.930
 degrees 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.660
 hence the question you would be able to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.870
 this incident beam focussing with a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 angle greater than the limit angle and I 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.430
 I tell you yes 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.190
 It's what we 're going to check now you 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.090
 note that this angle of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.120
 incidence and is greater than the limit 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.590
 proposed in the previous example, which 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.010
 happens in this case is that there is no more 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.360
 refraction of light rays occurs 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.150
 reflection with reflection angle r 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.010
 equal to the angle and in this situation we 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.200
 we say that reflection is a reflection 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.070
 total reflection is also 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 known as internal reflection and is 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.540
 different from the external reflection that is 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.960
 reflection we study for the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.870
 mirrors when external reflection occurs 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.630
 at the same time but proportions 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.210
 different phenomena occur. 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.170
 reflection and refraction 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.440
 in this case when the reflection is total 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.050
 refraction does not occur ok 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.209
 total reflection has very 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.120
 practices in our lives 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.730
 You 've certainly heard of 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.010
 optical fiber the principle of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.670
 operation of transmission of 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.260
 information through fiber optics is the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.080
 total reflection 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.290
 the optical fiber it consists of two 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.430
 different types of glass a glass that 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.150
 more interior called the nucleus and 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.420
 an outer glass that they call the cover 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.840
 for the production of optical fiber glass 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.410
 that is used in the core has the index 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.540
 of refraction greater than the video used 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 for the production of the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.610
 so who happens a source to read 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.639
 c emits light rays within the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.180
 of the fiber optic core and these 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.660
 light will go all inside and why 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.690
 total reflection occurs in this case because 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.810
 the angle of incidence with which the radius 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.900
 on the surface that divides the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.810
 and the cover is larger than the 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.960
 limit to equal the angle of incidence 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.380
 reflection angle when crossing 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.169
 again the light ray will go 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.680
 the other end also with 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.560
 an angle greater than the limit angle this 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.130
 will be repeated throughout the nucleus 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.979
 from the optical fiber to the final 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.130
 in fiber optics you should know that 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.220
 travels different light pulses 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.870
 electrical impulses that travel through the 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.930
 metal wires 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.750
 the fiber optic it is a more 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.260
 able to carry the largest 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.630
 amount of information and it is so 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.870
 that reaches points that are 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.700
 inaccessible to metal wires by 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.490
 so she used in tests 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.099
 endoscopy because the doctor will be able to 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.220
 and illuminate and capture point images 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.820
 which are inaccessible to other types 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:58.570
 of yarns as well as the reflection here 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.360
 total loss of energy over 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.669
 the whole course is minimal 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.760
 Good, I hope you understood. 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:10.210
 in the next class we will solve one 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.560
 exercise and we will also talk about the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.400
 mirages 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 do not lose
