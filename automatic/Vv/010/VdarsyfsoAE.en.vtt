okay<00:00:06.700> this<00:00:06.880> means<00:00:07.120> prospectors<00:00:07.810> will<00:00:08.020> be

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
okay this means prospectors will be

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.930 
okay this means prospectors will be

this<00:00:10.299> is<00:00:10.420> going<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.630> be<00:00:10.719> specially<00:00:11.200> forward

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680

besides<00:00:13.839> we'll<00:00:14.139> have<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.290> little<00:00:14.410> lateral

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
besides we'll have a little lateral

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.230 
besides we'll have a little lateral
motion<00:00:15.250> we'll<00:00:15.400> see<00:00:15.519> if<00:00:15.610> we<00:00:15.670> can<00:00:15.789> land<00:00:15.940> in<00:00:16.119> the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
motion we'll see if we can land in the

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.400 
motion we'll see if we can land in the
trailer<00:00:16.449> without<00:00:16.630> having<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.140> touch<00:00:17.289> the

may<00:00:55.210> have<00:00:55.390> got<00:00:55.600> lucky<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.080> that<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.560> cuz<00:00:56.710> I

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
may have got lucky on that just cuz I

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.920 
may have got lucky on that just cuz I

Lance I major expense fuel we'll try
that<00:01:03.160> test<00:01:03.460> again<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:04.000> see<00:01:04.449> if<00:01:04.480> we<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.660> do<00:01:04.750> a

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
that test again and see if we can do a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.170 
that test again and see if we can do a
second<00:01:05.140> time<00:01:08.040> again<00:01:09.040> thrust<00:01:09.430> vectors<00:01:09.820> test

is forward idle

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.870 
is forward idle
let's<00:01:13.900> take<00:01:14.080> number<00:01:14.350> two<00:01:14.560> try<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.580> approach

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
let's take number two try to approach

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.900 
let's take number two try to approach
the<00:01:16.030> trailer<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.510> idle<00:01:16.780> power<00:01:16.990> and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
the trailer and idle power and

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.800 
the trailer and idle power and
approaching<00:01:18.910> taking<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.240> right-hand<00:01:19.600> turn

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
approaching taking the right-hand turn

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.510 
approaching taking the right-hand turn
we<00:01:19.990> have<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.110> little<00:01:20.290> lateral<00:01:20.500> slip<00:01:20.980> there

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
we have a little lateral slip there

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.620 
we have a little lateral slip there
trying<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.850> land<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.090> little<00:01:22.150> trailer<00:01:22.420> without

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
trying to land a little trailer without

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:54.700 
trying to land a little trailer without
touching<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.020> throttles

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.200 

all<00:01:55.220> right<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.430> what<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.610> notice<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:55.970> with<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
all right so what you notice is with the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.640 
all right so what you notice is with the
thrust<00:01:56.390> vector<00:01:56.570> just<00:01:56.869> as<00:01:57.020> we<00:01:57.140> approach<00:01:57.440> the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
thrust vector just as we approach the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.649 
thrust vector just as we approach the
dot<00:01:57.830> approach<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> trailer<00:01:59.119> at<00:01:59.299> idle<00:01:59.630> speed

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
dot approach the trailer at idle speed

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.930 
dot approach the trailer at idle speed
and<00:02:00.229> basically<00:02:00.470> forward<00:02:00.920> idle<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
and basically forward idle this is the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.219 
and basically forward idle this is the
second<00:02:02.299> time<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.630> row<00:02:02.750> we<00:02:02.930> were<00:02:02.990> able<00:02:03.080> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
second time in a row we were able to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.800 
second time in a row we were able to
land<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.590> boat<00:02:03.800> on<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.490> trailer<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:05.150> forward

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
land the boat on the trailer and forward

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.420 
land the boat on the trailer and forward
idle<00:02:06.110> approaching<00:02:06.590> from<00:02:06.770> an<00:02:06.860> angle<00:02:07.190> where<00:02:07.310> we

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
idle approaching from an angle where we

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.370 
idle approaching from an angle where we
had<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.850> compensate<00:02:08.750> for<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.990> lateral

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
had to compensate for the lateral

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.440 
had to compensate for the lateral
slippage<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.640> basically<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:11.239> we<00:02:11.300> were

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
slippage so basically just now we were

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.180 
slippage so basically just now we were
able<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.630> land<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.930> twice<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.350> row<00:02:12.530> did<00:02:13.040> not

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
able to land it twice in a row did not

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.650 
able to land it twice in a row did not
touch<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.580> throttles<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.150> still<00:02:14.360> got<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> good

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
touch the throttles and still got a good

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.320 
touch the throttles and still got a good
capture<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:16.130> looks<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> begin<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.880> be<00:02:16.970> that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
capture so it looks to begin to be that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.940 
capture so it looks to begin to be that
the<00:02:17.569> grouse<00:02:17.840> renders<00:02:18.140> have<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.530> bit<00:02:18.709> more

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
the grouse renders have just a bit more

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.800 
the grouse renders have just a bit more
responsiveness<00:02:19.550> at<00:02:19.790> these<00:02:19.910> ultra<00:02:20.330> low<00:02:20.480> speeds

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
responsiveness at these ultra low speeds

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.330 
responsiveness at these ultra low speeds
we're<00:02:21.050> going<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> try<00:02:21.380> another<00:02:21.620> another<00:02:22.040> test

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we're going to try another another test

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400 
we're going to try another another test
here<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.610> moment<00:02:22.900> okay<00:02:23.900> coming<00:02:24.140> in<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
here in a moment okay coming in and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.020 
here in a moment okay coming in and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
broaching the dock at a little bit past

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
the treadle without touching the cross

00:02:31.489 --> 00:03:00.950 
the treadle without touching the cross
support<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.120> hope<00:02:32.900> it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.300 

okay<00:03:01.960> CL<00:03:02.290> what<00:03:02.440> we're<00:03:02.560> seeing<00:03:02.740> is<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.040> would

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
okay CL what we're seeing is that would

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.130 
okay CL what we're seeing is that would
come<00:03:03.459> in<00:03:03.640> with<00:03:03.790> idle<00:03:04.180> power<00:03:04.390> because<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.900> all

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
come in with idle power because of all

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.630 
come in with idle power because of all
the<00:03:05.230> forward<00:03:05.470> momentum<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:06.130> literally<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the forward momentum it's literally the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.370 
the forward momentum it's literally the
back<00:03:06.819> end<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.120> slide<00:03:07.630> now<00:03:07.930> there's<00:03:08.230> no

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
back end is just slide now there's no

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.230 
back end is just slide now there's no
way<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> control<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.760> fins<00:03:10.030> are

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
way to control it so the fins are

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.640 
way to control it so the fins are
definitely<00:03:10.569> giving<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.990> extra<00:03:11.200> bite<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
definitely giving you that extra bite to
