 about arbolite libelle and he left us 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.200
 just could not make a lasting impression 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.930
 but that crossbow was pocket so let's say 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.290
 Glupov shortened and it was an ordinary couples 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 boom speed and solid bed 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:07.860

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.569
 designer carbon shoulders and bed 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:36.090
 carbon fiber look very impressive 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:38.969
 but I can talk a lot about this ballet 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.880

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.780
 most line of sight and the line 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.830
 firing is one 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.000
 the fuse is located next to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.780

 is installed through the hole in 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.920
 Butt for our test we 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 used a novelty compact folding 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.430
 stand for the target 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.530
 light stand has a folding structure 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.870
 and fit in any car 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.760
 trunk to install steam 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.760
 it's easy enough to deploy and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.960
 secure with a special lock 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.590
 standard target set to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.330
 guide and held by a loop 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.760
 the assembled walls are quite steady 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.680
 his position does not change even if 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.660
 shoot Misha from a powerful crossbow 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.270
 despite the strong wind negative 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.020
 affecting the flight of arrows we set 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.770
 target at a distance of 55 meters 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.770
 let's see what happens 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.300
 he 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.270
 the result is shelling and everything is fine 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.510
 saw crossbow despite the fact that we 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.970
 shot bipod showed excellent accuracy 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.010
 but i think thanks nipples it and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.800
 happened because the wind is so 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.140
 strong i tried of course 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.360
 to aim but I have already sausage from 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.400
 side to side but in my opinion 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:15.800
 crossbow seemed a great weapon 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.739
 I think no one will be upset 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.799
 if the cube is not from the appearance is not from 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.900
 his tactical and technical characteristics 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.570
 crossbow that shoots at 360 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.840
 feet per second is enough to kill 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.790
 any type of ungulate in 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.250
 radius to one hundred meters but this if 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.890
 resemble of course as well up to fifty 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.650
 meters you can safely say that the crossbow 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.980
 suitable for any hunt all the best with 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.650
