platinum and lavender I'm going to start

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.879 
platinum and lavender I'm going to start
by<00:00:12.210> clipping<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> extensions<00:00:13.469> from<00:00:13.740> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
by clipping in the extensions from the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.070 
by clipping in the extensions from the
bottom<00:00:14.219> up<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:15.299> color<00:00:15.570> I'm<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
bottom up the first color I'm going to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.980 
bottom up the first color I'm going to
be<00:00:16.289> placing<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.160> Platinum<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.240> weft<00:00:18.690> has

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
be placing is the Platinum this weft has

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.080 
be placing is the Platinum this weft has
four<00:00:19.289> clips<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> start<00:00:20.250> off<00:00:20.340> by<00:00:20.400> clipping<00:00:20.970> in

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
four clips so I start off by clipping in

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.939 
four clips so I start off by clipping in
the<00:00:21.210> middle<00:00:21.510> ones<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.320> work<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.740> way

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the middle ones and then I work my way

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
the middle ones and then I work my way
to<00:00:23.010> each<00:00:23.279> side<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:24.060> think<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.660> easier<00:00:25.050> this

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
to each side I think it's easier this

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.259 
to each side I think it's easier this
way<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> love<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.640> these<00:00:26.910> new

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
way and what I love about these new

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.000 
way and what I love about these new
extensions<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.439> change<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.890> my

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
extensions is that I can change up my

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.830 
extensions is that I can change up my
look<00:00:29.039> without<00:00:29.460> having<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.330> dye<00:00:30.570> my

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
look without having to actually dye my

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.139 
look without having to actually dye my
hair<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.590> also<00:00:31.650> gives<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.219> length<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> volume

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
hair it also gives me length and volume

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
hair it also gives me length and volume
so<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.710> next<00:00:34.890> color<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:35.820> be

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so the next color that I will be

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.569 
so the next color that I will be
clipping<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.290> color<00:00:37.530> lavender<00:00:38.040> I'm

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
both sets because that would have been

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.410 
both sets because that would have been
