the parks set I have uploaded and
whatnot<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.510> yeah

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
whatnot and yeah

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.710 
whatnot and yeah
so<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.859> pretty<00:02:56.980> cool<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.120> easy<00:02:58.420> it's

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
so it's pretty cool and easy it's

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.910 
so it's pretty cool and easy it's
actually<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.230> think<00:02:59.319> it's<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.650> little<00:02:59.829> bit

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
actually I think it's a little bit

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.099 
actually I think it's a little bit
easier<00:03:00.040> than<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.700> was<00:03:00.880> when<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.810> was<00:03:01.870> the

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
easier than it was when there was the

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.809 
easier than it was when there was the
website<00:03:02.530> it's<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.220> little<00:03:03.609> bit<00:03:03.700> more

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
website it's just a little bit more

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.590 
website it's just a little bit more
time-consuming

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
time-consuming

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.259 
time-consuming
