00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 and I know it's not the fault of sergio bueno 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.930
 nor of the current staff at 17 years old and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 medium that he carries with his action without being 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.969
 champion but yes 3 that load and the people 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 today boo obviously and we will go 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.360
 away from the stream also his list of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 eight frame errors zúñiga situation 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.949
 ends here very clear the young today 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.539
 It could have lasted for half an hour 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.670
 more the match that blue cross is not goal 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.320
 and he did not look around if he has a pair 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 of successful interventions here the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.910
 problem for blue cross is that you can not 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.410
 start losing in your house against a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.469
 team that fights dissent that is reinforced 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 well it is well directed with enrique meza 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.390
 lose 30 in your house because because the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.129
 pressure starts for blue cross does not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
 start the tournament because and the next 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.170
 week feels it to guadalajara without 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.170
 legs 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 loading clear permanence is fine 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.989
 I do not think the good sergio is to blame 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 what happens today has its responsibility 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 the problem is that it is still a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
 badly organized team bad plan that that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.829
 it's the big problem that goes back to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.329
 start the tournament rebuilds 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.329
 doubts lacked 9 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 mocking but it is even funny 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 and you can refer to things saying in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.060
 the date 45 one of your reinforcements today 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.770
 it will arrive and it seems true with intention 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.990
 inevitably and variably ends this 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 equipment delivering a reinforcement that 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 ends by not adapting of course and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 you wish you had and I forgot the term 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.470
 that angel did not share makes a with 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.730
 programs regarding victory 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 I think it was the term towards 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.880
 hydrolyzed the recruit me 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 recruitment exactly cross blue is 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.490
 unacceptable that the players 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 surely to whom do you mean what 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.150
 do that but then the owners or 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 whoever is responsible to lift the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.720
 most please sir, let's attack 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 this background problem because it 's a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.930
 constant and it has nothing to do with sergio 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 well it does not have to do with memo vázquez 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.960
 it has nothing to do with luis fernando tena 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.940
 he who invariably passes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 I am in blue cross is and navisa see 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.340
 moving away we have a list of how many 18 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.649
 88 forgive you also hear what 70 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.150
 we made the previous cross ways 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.780
 blue the previous environment and we said is 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.700
 if not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.590
 reds did not unbalance they did not bring 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
 nobody to do it is that torrado if 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.709
 you are going to put it and you are going to trust the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.569
 local, put a flyer that has a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.130
 little more than dynamic type croses that 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.830
 have good outputs but they cost you 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.180
 and back to see 8 and there's everything in the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.830
 hobby had already threatened when I was the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.780
 stadium raises the price of tickets 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.940
 for this game against morelia pe de 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.040
 blunder 2 did not get the pass 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.360
 fight and one of your reinforcements can not 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.920
 be not even the bank because 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.920
 administratively it can not be 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 Vehicles 3 had three months to plan 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.590
 the season there is no forward center nor 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.660
 offensive flyer 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.800
 today they missed a German rock 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.110
 biancucchi the tangle to all 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.360
 torrado is your 4 penalty collector as well 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.860
 walk the team processes that is a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.510
 reinforcement in luxury theory ended up being 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.010
 relieved relieved of agreement of 5 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.690
 direct two players 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.340
 a garcía sancho the central exposes to 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.319
 zúñiga el chavo in the second debut 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.440
 roasted when there is so much pressure and goes to 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.760
 start at home with so many reflectors 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.190
 zúñiga cow and fabia saints are your 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.500
 changes so you're going to try to turn it around 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.720
 a match 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.780
 to 60 in social networks I stay the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.880
 blue cross account minute 66 the tweet me 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.400
 gave a lot of laughter the defense prevents the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.620
 fourth goal hashtag loyalty blue the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.260
 defense prevents the quantum between sign of 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.240
 exclamation and the eighth what you want 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.800
 rafa lack that arrives that reinforcement that goes 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.110
 to be debuting on the date six or 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.970
 seven more than a blue cross disaster in 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.470
 sports management a total disaster 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.470
 begins to pick up those fruits
