00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 hi to all the boys I'm a bola 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.740
 created welcome back here on my channel 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.070
 here we are again on minecraft with a new one 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 videos are back in the world where I have 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.020
 built my villa and I had you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.810
 said that it was constantly evolving and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.869
 that I would continue to expand it 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.939
 we say it is continually is that a prey 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 I would have built something beautiful that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 I would have shown another video 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 well here it is today video in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 which I did not properly expand the villa 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.969
 but I've built some interesting things 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.100
 around 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 we immediately begin to see what I have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.860
 built 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.770
 meanwhile, as said, made an entrance 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 decent with a narrow street here in front of the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.860
 my house is a nice little port 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.969
 all automated boats e 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.699
 illuminated waited a moment 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.059
 they wait for it a moment before 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.950
 I show while here as you see 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.589
 you can take boats 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.270
 the marina 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.180
 and this is the first construction that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.390
 I'll go and show you then 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.070
 brake brake brake brake meanwhile as 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.050
 first thing I would point out is that 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.360
 there is a beautiful parking lot for the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.340
 boats where you can safely 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.450
 insert the boat in there if there was 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.150
 made of now I do not want to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.400
 try it here and that can be 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.520
 conveniently closed with this lever 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.660
 now it is closed and if dario presses 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 obviously this opens here is a 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.970
 very large restaurant done in between 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.300
 to the sea completely of very glass 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.950
 chic and toso in my opinion here I did not put 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.850
 the village aspertini of the new style o 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.030
 however the reception type something so 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.250
 and this is the first room with all the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 tables made with and pistons do not tell you 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.350
 what a mess I had to make to do 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.210
 stand on all these pistons because 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.729
 below here this ace wood 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.310
 water and so it was rather 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.560
 complicated 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.650
 notice these lamps that I have 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.019
 defining the roof is done all in 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.959
 pink stone nightmare of red stone 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.790
 because as you have seen tender villa lo 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.610
 I use a lot because a material because 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.890
 really a lot 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.070
 because there is really a lot we go to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.480
 see the upper floor 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.570
 here it is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.110
 here is the room we say with the tables 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.960
 great for when there is a lot of typical people 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.540
 parties or wedding stuff so that's needed 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.150
 a very large table and I put it here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.210
 these tables on purpose is like you can 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.130
 seeing the view is really fantastic 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:55.080
 you see it's all for the whole sea 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.110
 these things going on here we pass the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.600
 second part while here as you see 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.110
 there is the kitchen item fi.ga continuing 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.100
 over 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.610
 I'll show you this which is enough 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.760
 spacious but easy then all is well that is 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.790
 the hotel guys this is the reception a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.350
 very mud hotel this is the corridor 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.080
 I'll show you a room for you one 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.850
 for example, but I'll show you that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 I think it's more beautiful if I remember 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:36.090
 which one is this 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.670
 all furnished as all the others 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410
 rooms obviously there is also the bathroom that 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.170
 few rooms of what to check the bathroom 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.959
 because the owners are stingy with 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:51.000
 double sink a useless now the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.760
 ces is the best part of cultural of 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.239
 everything I've built guys 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.410
 so it's also this is the only room 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.470
 and have a terrace with sea view 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.390
 perfect all the other bonus rooms 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:13.430
 there are five hotel rooms 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.430
 and I 'm pretty nice and all of them 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.859
 if you want to continue at the bottom of this 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:23.210
 corridor you will find these stairs going up 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:28.850
 and you will arrive on the roof of the building 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.850
 a part in my opinion very beautiful 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.200
 for the view because it is pretty on sight 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.210
 as always beautiful here put this 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.990
 tub of water that he liked from almost to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.850
 all the view on the restaurant 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.520
 unfortunately the villa cannot be seen because 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.170
 too far away anyway and at the restaurant 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.420
 the villa can be seen with or without all the 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:02.140
 bank all the lamps made very rows 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:05.900
 what with the stone they are called 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.650
 boys linguistic properties 0 le 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.270
 hatches as a point always becoming 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.990
 worse to talk guys one thing 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.450
 hallucinating hallucinating 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.980
 we continue with our ride with 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.050
 this video will be rather short 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.780
 compared to the other because it's not me 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.270
 he built the Bourbon king and in any case 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:33.620
 this is a very pretty part is one 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:36.590
 area that runs all around the hotel 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.580
 made in glass with benches on which 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.040
 you can sit and admire this bridge 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.160
 I have to put the obviously and years to 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.150
 rowing you see the restaurant does a 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.800
 po hinton anza the joy you see is al 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.600
 center as you can see there is a strange one 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.560
 a glass drip that holds within 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:04.550
 water flowing around the pillar of 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.530
 lapis lazuli which is a motorcycle 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.920
 just this area here this whole 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.570
 area does very well at night and now is 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.210
 as the sun goes down I show 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.640
 to do faster 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:21.500
 wait a moment 15 go away 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.770
 here it is at night it is very rich and 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.800
 very pretty but especially when viewed from 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.800
 far 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.060
 but enchantment 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.880
 look at that cool seen from above 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:37.240
 especially this part here is a lot 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.580
 beautiful I must say that I like it so much and I have 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.630
 already absurd ideas about how 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:47.410
 continue this from this area here I have 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.940
 really ideas a lot of ideas and some 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.810
 I'm an element now looking 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.930
 from above and I must say that probably 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.730
 here you will see many absurd extensions 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.900
 really absurd 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.110
 if I can accomplish what 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.240
 I think I think we will succeed 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.420
 anyway this video got short 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.970
 ends here I invite you to leave a 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.310
 like series the whole i like this 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.810
 extension, let's say, of billone wood 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.610
 that you can charge it the world here it is 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.760
 I will definitely make them another video on 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:25.000
 mya kraft as soon as I haven't expanded 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.850
 still something big enough 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.100
 or I won't have built something in 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:32.800
 something that in some other world 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.180
 I already have projects in progress but it is not 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.340
 that I have all this time of 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.620
 build stuff on minecraft guys one 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.120
 because I do it only in dead moments 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.970
 because it is not that I am a fan of 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.920
 minecraft and the other reason is that I have to 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.690
 study because the exams shortly and 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.730
 so i need 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.230
 I don't have much time to stay in front of 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.760
 pc girls this is also the reason for 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:56.650
 I'm doing a few videos lately 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.750
 so this video as I said before 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:03.610
 ends here left a nice I like if
