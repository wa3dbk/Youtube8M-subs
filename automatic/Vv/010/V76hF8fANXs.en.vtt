up tire ready and you know what Leslie
and<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> expander<00:00:09.330> crap<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:10.080> is

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and this is the expander crap this is

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.299 
and this is the expander crap this is
the<00:00:10.410> 16<00:00:10.950> foot<00:00:11.160> wide<00:00:11.759> glide<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.990> made<00:00:13.769> you

know with fishing and photography in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.859 
know with fishing and photography in
mind<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.859> plenty<00:00:17.220> stable<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:18.090> stand<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.690> on

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
mind it's plenty stable to stand up on

mind it's plenty stable to stand up on
you<00:00:19.500> actually<00:00:19.859> cannot<00:00:20.310> flip<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.939> open<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.990> can

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
you actually cannot flip it open you can

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.950 
you actually cannot flip it open you can
follow<00:00:22.320> off<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.949> can't<00:00:23.189> flip<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.460> over

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
follow off but you can't flip it over

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.859 
follow off but you can't flip it over
it's<00:00:24.960> easy<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> swivel<00:00:25.920> seat<00:00:26.869> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
it's easy it's got a swivel seat it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's easy it's got a swivel seat it's
kind<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.140> hard<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.590> which<00:00:28.769> ways<00:00:28.980> forward

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
kind of hard to see which ways forward

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
kind of hard to see which ways forward
in<00:00:29.580> backwards<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.689> I've<00:00:30.810> done<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.260> I've

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
in backwards but what I've done is I've

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
in backwards but what I've done is I've
mounted<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> only<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> 20<00:00:33.360> pound

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
mounted and this is only a 20 pound

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
mounted and this is only a 20 pound
thrust<00:00:34.230> motor<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> mounted<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
thrust motor and I mounted that in the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.450 
thrust motor and I mounted that in the
front<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:36.809> reason<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.739> 16<00:00:38.160> foot

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
front for good reason it's a 16 foot

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.369 
front for good reason it's a 16 foot
boat<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:39.930> able<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> be

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
boat and if you want to be able to be

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.100 
boat and if you want to be able to be
turning<00:00:41.010> hands-free<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> rudder<00:00:42.899> in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
turning hands-free I have a rudder in

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
turning hands-free I have a rudder in
the<00:00:43.200> back<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.649> actuated<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.640> foot

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the back that's actuated with my foot

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
the back that's actuated with my foot
and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.860> actuate<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> motor<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> front

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and I can actuate the motor in the front

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.270 
and I can actuate the motor in the front
but<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.370> paddling<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.890> that<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> can

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but I'm not paddling it that way you can

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.060 
but I'm not paddling it that way you can
turn<00:00:53.430> much<00:00:53.730> sharper<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> when<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> put<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
turn much sharper so when you put the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.240 
turn much sharper so when you put the
motor<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.989> again<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.590> 20<00:00:59.039> pound

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
motor in again this is only a 20 pound

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.240 
motor in again this is only a 20 pound
thrust<00:00:59.699> that's<00:01:00.059> very<00:01:00.480> small<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.939> can

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
thrust that's very small and now I can

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.469 
thrust that's very small and now I can
turn<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> front<00:01:08.790> which<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
turn the front which that's going to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.990 
turn the front which that's going to
pull<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> front<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.590> then<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> step<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.790> my

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
pull the front and then I step on my

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
pull the front and then I step on my
plate<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.020> actuates<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> rudder<00:01:13.979> in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
plate here which actuates the rudder in

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.580 
plate here which actuates the rudder in
the<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.430> allowing<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> turn<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> 16

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the back allowing you to turn the 16

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.039 
the back allowing you to turn the 16
foot<00:01:16.619> boat<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> whole<00:01:18.360> lot<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.600> ease

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
foot boat with a whole lot more ease

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
foot boat with a whole lot more ease
than<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.710> had<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.340> rudder<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
than if you just had a rudder and if you

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.320 
than if you just had a rudder and if you
had<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> motor<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> have

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
had the motor in the back then you have

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
had the motor in the back then you have
to<00:01:24.450> constantly<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.990> reaching<00:01:25.259> behind<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to constantly be reaching behind you to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.300 
to constantly be reaching behind you to
control

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
control

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.820 
control
I<00:01:27.340> think<00:01:28.180> this<00:01:28.420> setup<00:01:28.990> works<00:01:29.350> nicer<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:32.560> course

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
I think this setup works nicer of course

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.940 
I think this setup works nicer of course
this<00:01:33.520> is<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.730> one-piece<00:01:34.540> deck<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.500> decking

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
this is the one-piece deck the decking

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.240 
this is the one-piece deck the decking
is<00:01:36.100> two<00:01:36.310> feet<00:01:36.520> wide<00:01:36.820> by<00:01:37.300> 8<00:01:37.570> feet<00:01:37.840> long<00:01:38.250> decking

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
is two feet wide by 8 feet long decking

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.800 
is two feet wide by 8 feet long decking
you<00:01:39.370> can<00:01:39.520> have<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.820> done<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.270> many<00:01:40.450> different

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
you can have it done so many different

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.220 
you can have it done so many different
ways<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.290> chose<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.830> go<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.460> one

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
ways but I chose to go with this one

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.690 
ways but I chose to go with this one
simply<00:01:44.230> because<00:01:44.350> it's<00:01:44.740> at<00:01:45.130> least<00:01:45.280> amount<00:01:45.580> of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
simply because it's at least amount of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.610 
simply because it's at least amount of
material<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.330> need<00:01:46.600> for<00:01:46.810> one<00:01:47.050> person<00:01:47.530> to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
material that you need for one person to

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.130 
material that you need for one person to
go<00:01:47.710> fishing<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.640> got<00:01:48.790> plenty<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.210> space<00:01:49.480> I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
go fishing you got plenty of space I

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.580 
go fishing you got plenty of space I
don't<00:01:50.410> even<00:01:50.620> bother<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.160> anchor<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.880> down

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
don't even bother to anchor it down

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.620 
don't even bother to anchor it down
although<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.650> have<00:01:53.770> spaces<00:01:54.070> for<00:01:54.280> that<00:01:54.670> unless

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
although I have spaces for that unless

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.840 
although I have spaces for that unless
you're<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.410> ocean<00:01:56.740> you're<00:01:57.670> not

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you're going out in the ocean you're not

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.410 
you're going out in the ocean you're not
going<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.090> fall<00:01:58.750> over<00:01:59.230> or<00:01:59.280> or<00:02:00.280> lose<00:02:01.000> anything
