00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 thirty lonely girls are here at 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.120
 present in this video enough 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.219
 easy is very fast for the effects what 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 it happened today I saw better myself 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.790
 did you find out why not points 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.770
 I was aware of this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.020
 the introduction of moving the blackbird 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.020
 for the high this is the weekend 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.900
 of the saint patrician of sel peggio and then 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 will make you like every year or better than that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.939
 will introduce the born as every year the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 Irish tournament that just that tournament 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 who can to whom it can be precisely 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
 participate if only one is present 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.980
 team involved by eighteen players 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 all Irish 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.920
 and what needs to bring today 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 I decided to show what an excuse 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.539
 I will use it though you are probably saying 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 only this issued boys today there 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.289
 I'll bring you this because in fact I had 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 want to make a big megane in the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.489
 quality team games and we tried 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 in direct exceeds let's say win it 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.690
 tournament only what happened I have 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 known that it is precisely this tournament 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.620
 sorry for the repetition of terni kucera 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.420
 at 7pm and that was a little what they have to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.400
 I'll do tonight I'll go see the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.150
 team of my basketball city that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.229
 precisely one plays and something very special 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.080
 even this match will also be 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.150
 meta broadcast on sky so what 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.950
 really tactics anyway guys 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.200
 trivial senses do not seem other things to me 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.759
 say how you can well pulled the voice 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 a little low poly really are 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.320
 destroyed i 'm having weeks 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 embarrassing and will accomplish last thing 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.380
 there's guys 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 obviously I had to buy the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.509
 Irish players and buying them me 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 I realized how much has been 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.070
 created deadly introduction of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 price trenches guys is one thing 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 embarrassing players are not found 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.759
 at auction apart from me before i 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 leiber transfers at 4 million now 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.259
 they are only one million and 421 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 but if you want to find good players or 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.420
 there are no longer on the market or monitored 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.219
 but you just never find them or there 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.890
 found but you can search for 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.880
 to buy 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.040
 so what were bought 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 however, it seems very little else 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.150
 let's start defensively as you can 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.310
 being central we find on one side and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.540
 on the other hand, systems guide a moment 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.490
 say that these players are those 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.160
 that I managed to buy because 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.810
 in fact what happens if you wish you could 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.730
 even looking for the best but I can 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.620
 ensure that they are nowhere to be found 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.050
 example the bronze central defender 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.880
 Irish that is nowhere to be found is not found 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.500
 so I chose williams and dunes that 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.510
 alice that doesn't seem bad enough 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.800
 with them I played a game because 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.330
 facts I have tried this team and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.040
 online season I must say that it is 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.880
 quite liked by the concierge 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 in fact the goalkeeper 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.040
 we'll talk about it later as a left-back 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.230
 instead use state 281 tube has 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.550
 given 5 thousand because to 5,000 why 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.269
 obviously another very thing 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.830
 intelligent 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.480
 the country has meant that the players 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.570
 Irish from a starter price 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.519
 of 150 to 1 final of 5 thousand and of course 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.080
 there are only players at the price 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.550
 so buy most of it now 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.620
 i paid this team players i 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.330
 5000 credits as extra interaction 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.610
 I use the version instead coleman 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.680
 skill 80 let's move on to the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.260
 midfielders as cc use from 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.140
 part of edison and on the other a cdc 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.360
 these tell us but who will be 16 this 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.310
 speaking is markets that the euro guys 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.890
 phenomenon and according to me it would go fr 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.480
 playing them especially life was the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.170
 St. Patrick's Cup because in fact 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.790
 weapons teams the legal tau book trailer 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.880
 Trident knew the average entry 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.560
 scandalous as you can well see 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.360
 give away what is related to the medinah 03 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.800
 coleman 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.810
 coincidence I do not see pass instead 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.690
 adjectives like chelsea use in the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.190
 as an additive use of logos and how 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.840
 left wing use left exterior 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.819
 which is mac donald norman mcbean the boys 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.769
 to find this player I am due 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.120
 stand benti minutes on the market 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.760
 transfers to continue updating 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.370
 the really is an embarrassing thing 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.980
 rather reported spending maybe 20 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.769
 30,000 injured but no, but no 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 I had to stay 20 minutes to update 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.610
 the dvd page anyway guys this 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.010
 here the small team a council that 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.079
 I give you it is precisely that of defenders 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.180
 there are no Irish power plants 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.890
 fast bets in motion are it stands 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.230
 in fact I decided to use this 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.819
 so why in the end if you have player 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.410
 pretty fast a very good form 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.200
 how well you can see my attack 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.579
 arts type of medium speed 83 purposes not 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.060
 it seems to me bad at all we never click 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.150
 and fast 84 long all 85 instead made in 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.340
 89 so bet a lot on the prostate is 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.520
 the only one talking about boys' goalkeeper 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.530
 council goalkeeper absolutely of 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.740
 take the concierge of the aston villa 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.479
 he lives for the boys in the game 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.710
 first used by Europe we have 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.050
 immediately with murphy 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.789
 but guys on embarrassing doormen 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.280
 chelsea there is a player you owe yourself 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.830
 take and kim is however as you can well 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.570
 see is not on the market then 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.610
 I don't know if we can get well or 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.380
 less with galeazzi this was mine 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 team will have to go out on the finger in the 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.860
 which I will try to win the tournament 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.720
 or it will do a live streaming 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.520
 advise me in comments what you prefer 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.990
 that I say well I am more in da 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.660
 say apologize you heard with 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.450
 this rumor that though boy tired or 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.449
 low voice, however, but tomorrow I will try 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.610
 to stand by my side 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.960
 and been parties I came to get me to 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.409
 our part 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.409
 Hi everyone
