rest are say swivel joint but here ya be

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.949 
rest are say swivel joint but here ya be
really<00:02:32.620> careful<00:02:32.830> I'm<00:02:33.280> trying<00:02:34.150> not<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.420> force

it because I you do run the risk of us
napping<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.250> whole<00:02:39.430> joint<00:02:39.760> off<00:02:40.090> what<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.020> did

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
napping this whole joint off what I did

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610 
napping this whole joint off what I did
was<00:02:41.370> heated<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:43.060> show<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.870> elbow<00:02:44.140> up<00:02:44.320> with

was heated the show the elbow up with

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.670 
was heated the show the elbow up with
with<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> hair<00:02:45.580> dryer<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:46.030> about<00:02:46.320> 15<00:02:47.320> seconds

or so and i'll be i was able to me to

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.240 
or so and i'll be i was able to me to
join<00:02:50.890> quite<00:02:51.550> easily<00:02:51.760> after<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.410> so

this leg it's a little harder to move
around<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.660> bit<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.390> other<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.959> a

this<00:04:14.160> Lake<00:04:14.400> here<00:04:15.889> also<00:04:16.889> right<00:04:17.459> now<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.910> am<00:04:17.940> not

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
this Lake here also right now I am not

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.990 
this Lake here also right now I am not
exactly<00:04:18.570> sure<00:04:18.799> whose<00:04:19.799> mass<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.489> belongs<00:04:20.850> to

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
exactly sure whose mass this belongs to

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.180 
exactly sure whose mass this belongs to
it<00:04:21.389> doesn't<00:04:21.690> look<00:04:21.750> like<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.049> fits<00:04:22.169> him<00:04:22.440> that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
it doesn't look like it fits him that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.070 
it doesn't look like it fits him that
well<00:04:23.400> um<00:04:24.979> can't<00:04:25.979> really<00:04:26.400> have<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.060> go<00:04:27.330> over<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
well um can't really have it go over the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.320 
well um can't really have it go over the
hood<00:04:28.490> cuz<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.699> is<00:04:30.060> quite<00:04:30.630> small<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:32.330> it

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
hood cuz it is quite small but it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.540 
hood cuz it is quite small but it
doesn't<00:04:33.690> fit<00:04:33.870> his<00:04:34.050> face<00:04:34.410> too<00:04:34.710> well<00:04:34.919> either<00:04:35.100> so

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
doesn't fit his face too well either so

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.180 
doesn't fit his face too well either so
I'm<00:04:35.729> thinking<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> might<00:04:36.240> not<00:04:36.419> be<00:04:36.600> for<00:04:36.960> him<00:04:37.190> but

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
I'm thinking it might not be for him but

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.950 
I'm thinking it might not be for him but
I<00:04:38.250> guess<00:04:38.490> we'll<00:04:38.669> find<00:04:39.000> out<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.389> game<00:04:39.630> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
I guess we'll find out in the game but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.850 
I guess we'll find out in the game but
if<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:40.830> want<00:04:41.040> him<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.460> awareness<00:04:42.419> Mesa<00:04:43.290> p<00:04:43.530> on

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
if you want him to awareness Mesa p on

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.219 
if you want him to awareness Mesa p on
the<00:04:44.190> hood<00:04:44.370> again<00:04:44.610> is<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> softer<00:04:45.750> type<00:04:46.110> of

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
the hood again is a softer type of

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.020 
the hood again is a softer type of
rubber<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.040> could<00:04:47.250> pull<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.610> hood<00:04:47.790> back

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
rubber so you could pull the hood back
