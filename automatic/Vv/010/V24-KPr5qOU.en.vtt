00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the car but I wanted something to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.380 
the car but I wanted something to
basically<00:00:23.380> bring<00:00:24.070> out<00:00:24.250> a<00:00:24.550> little<00:00:24.970> bit<00:00:25.180> more

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
basically bring out a little bit more

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.870 
basically bring out a little bit more
aggressiveness<00:00:26.020> out<00:00:26.290> of<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:26.560> car<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.190> you

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
aggressiveness out of the car and you

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.030 
aggressiveness out of the car and you
know<00:00:28.150> the<00:00:28.300> reduce<00:00:28.570> body<00:00:28.840> roll<00:00:28.990> as<00:00:29.320> well<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.010> I

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
know the reduce body roll as well and I

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.950 
know the reduce body roll as well and I
think<00:00:30.070> this<00:00:30.490> thing<00:00:30.670> iBox<00:00:31.180> wave<00:00:31.450> outfit<00:00:31.810> is

think this thing iBox wave outfit is
going<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.410> be<00:00:32.650> perfect<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:33.550> let's<00:00:34.030> go<00:00:34.150> over<00:00:34.240> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
going to be perfect so let's go over the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.500 
going to be perfect so let's go over the
kit<00:00:34.600> itself<00:00:34.810> included<00:00:35.740> is<00:00:36.040> a<00:00:36.250> 22<00:00:37.000> millimeter

kit itself included is a 22 millimeter
rear<00:00:37.900> sway<00:00:38.290> bar<00:00:38.500> which<00:00:39.310> is<00:00:39.340> adjustable<00:00:40.060> as<00:00:40.210> you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
rear sway bar which is adjustable as you

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.300 
rear sway bar which is adjustable as you
can<00:00:40.510> see<00:00:40.690> there<00:00:40.960> now<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.590> adjustments<00:00:42.190> on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
can see there now the adjustments on

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.200 
can see there now the adjustments on
these<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.780> one<00:00:44.020> towards<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.310> sway<00:00:45.970> bar

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
these the one towards the sway bar

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.330 
these the one towards the sway bar
itself<00:00:46.570> so<00:00:46.780> closest<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.800> sway<00:00:47.950> bar<00:00:48.160> is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
itself so closest to the sway bar is

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.490 
itself so closest to the sway bar is
actually<00:00:49.030> going<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.210> be<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.480> stiffer<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.260> the

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
actually going to be the stiffer of the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually going to be the stiffer of the
two<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.250> one<00:00:51.430> away<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.940> actually<00:00:52.420> going<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.600> be

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
two the one away is actually going to be

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.229 
two the one away is actually going to be
the<00:00:53.050> softer<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.340> two<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.760> basically

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
the softer of the two and basically

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.270 
the softer of the two and basically
think<00:00:55.450> of<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.630> like<00:00:55.810> leverage<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:57.040> know<00:00:57.130> the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
think of that like leverage you know the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.350 
think of that like leverage you know the
further<00:00:57.520> out<00:00:57.700> away<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:57.970> are<00:00:58.060> the<00:00:58.180> more

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
further out away you are the more

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.000 
further out away you are the more
leverage<00:00:58.720> you<00:00:58.810> have<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.110> easier<00:00:59.560> it<00:00:59.680> is<00:00:59.770> to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
leverage you have the easier it is to

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.610 
leverage you have the easier it is to
twist<00:01:00.489> that<00:01:00.610> swing<00:01:00.880> around<00:01:00.970> okay<00:01:01.480> now<00:01:01.840> for<00:01:02.560> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
twist that swing around okay now for the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.460 
twist that swing around okay now for the
front<00:01:03.010> we've<00:01:03.340> got<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.550> beefy<00:01:04.059> 25<00:01:04.690> millimeter

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
front we've got a beefy 25 millimeter

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.180 
front we've got a beefy 25 millimeter
sway<00:01:05.770> bar<00:01:05.950> now<00:01:06.640> these<00:01:07.030> two<00:01:07.510> should<00:01:07.870> give<00:01:08.080> a

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
sway bar now these two should give a

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.520 
sway bar now these two should give a
significantly<00:01:09.190> reduced<00:01:10.030> body<00:01:10.659> roll<00:01:10.990> compared

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
significantly reduced body roll compared

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.010 
significantly reduced body roll compared
to<00:01:11.770> stock<00:01:12.250> which<00:01:13.120> is<00:01:13.150> fantastic<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
to stock which is fantastic and the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.140 
to stock which is fantastic and the
thing<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.290> like<00:01:14.440> about<00:01:14.470> sway<00:01:14.920> bars<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.430> they

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
thing I like about sway bars is they

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.910 
thing I like about sway bars is they
don't<00:01:16.360> really<00:01:16.720> increase<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.530> noise

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
don't really increase the noise

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.460 
don't really increase the noise
harshness<00:01:18.400> or<00:01:18.729> vibrations<00:01:19.420> in<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.780> cart<00:01:20.200> and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
harshness or vibrations in the cart and

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.810 
harshness or vibrations in the cart and
so<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:20.710> kind<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:20.890> one<00:01:21.040> of<00:01:21.070> those<00:01:21.250> one<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.760> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
so it's kind of one of those one of the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.060 
so it's kind of one of those one of the
few<00:01:22.060> modifications<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.080> can<00:01:23.290> do<00:01:23.470> where

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
few modifications that you can do where

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.750 
few modifications that you can do where
you<00:01:24.100> do<00:01:24.460> gain<00:01:25.110> grip<00:01:26.110> without<00:01:26.590> actually<00:01:27.159> losing

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
you do gain grip without actually losing

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.140 
you do gain grip without actually losing
the<00:01:28.330> comfort<00:01:28.750> which<00:01:29.350> is<00:01:29.380> great<00:01:29.860> alright<00:01:30.790> next

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
the comfort which is great alright next

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.830 
the comfort which is great alright next
up<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.530> does<00:01:32.860> come<00:01:33.100> with<00:01:33.360> bushing<00:01:34.360> which<00:01:34.690> is

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
up it does come with bushing which is

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.490 
up it does come with bushing which is
fantastic

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500

going to be a pretty easy install over
all<00:01:50.680> front<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.920> rear<00:01:52.130> should<00:01:52.340> both<00:01:52.550> be<00:01:52.760> fairly

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
all front and rear should both be fairly

a<00:05:22.220> corner<00:05:22.550> and<00:05:22.580> then<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:22.910> becomes<00:05:23.270> immediately

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
a corner and then it becomes immediately

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.170 
a corner and then it becomes immediately
noticeable<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:25.039> they're<00:05:25.250> there<00:05:25.400> next<00:05:26.090> thing

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
noticeable that they're there next thing

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.270 
noticeable that they're there next thing
I<00:05:26.270> wanted<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:26.570> touch<00:05:26.780> on<00:05:27.020> that<00:05:27.229> sounds<00:05:28.130> good

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
I wanted to touch on that sounds good

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.779 
I wanted to touch on that sounds good
was<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.419> install<00:05:29.840> itself<00:05:30.229> I<00:05:30.560> think<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:31.610> took

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
was the install itself I think it took

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.990 
was the install itself I think it took
me<00:05:32.169> maybe<00:05:33.169> an<00:05:33.380> hour<00:05:33.650> total<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.639> was<00:05:34.820> with

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
me maybe an hour total and that was with

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.820 
me maybe an hour total and that was with
really<00:05:35.360> taking<00:05:35.720> my<00:05:35.840> time<00:05:36.050> setting<00:05:36.620> up<00:05:36.710> the

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
really taking my time setting up the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.600 
really taking my time setting up the
cameras

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
cameras

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.510 
cameras
I<00:05:37.639> mean<00:05:38.090> basically<00:05:40.270> going<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:42.620> know<00:05:42.740> taking

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
I mean basically going you know taking

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.150 
I mean basically going you know taking
my<00:05:43.669> sweet<00:05:44.270> time<00:05:44.710> getting<00:05:45.710> these<00:05:45.800> on<00:05:45.979> so

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
my sweet time getting these on so

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.219 
my sweet time getting these on so
realistically<00:05:46.789> if<00:05:46.880> you're<00:05:47.000> at<00:05:47.090> home<00:05:47.120> even<00:05:47.630> you

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
realistically if you're at home even you

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.330 
realistically if you're at home even you
know<00:05:48.349> just<00:05:48.560> underneath<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.949> car<00:05:49.130> with<00:05:49.280> the

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
know just underneath the car with the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.710 
know just underneath the car with the
car<00:05:49.490> up<00:05:49.580> on<00:05:49.699> jack<00:05:49.910> stands<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.360> could<00:05:50.510> probably

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
car up on jack stands you could probably

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.860 
car up on jack stands you could probably
get<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:50.960> done<00:05:51.199> in<00:05:51.500> like<00:05:52.460> 45<00:05:52.760> minutes<00:05:53.090> and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
get it done in like 45 minutes and

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.600 
get it done in like 45 minutes and
that's<00:05:54.080> a<00:05:54.440> pretty<00:05:54.770> realistic<00:05:55.220> time<00:05:55.580> frame

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
that's a pretty realistic time frame

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.140 
that's a pretty realistic time frame
either<00:05:56.479> way<00:05:57.370> I'm<00:05:58.370> going<00:05:58.490> to<00:05:58.580> keep<00:05:58.669> on<00:05:58.760> driving

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
either way I'm going to keep on driving

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.750 
either way I'm going to keep on driving
this<00:05:59.210> car<00:05:59.449> I<00:06:00.260> can<00:06:00.680> still<00:06:00.979> adjust<00:06:01.099> the<00:06:01.520> sway

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
this car I can still adjust the sway

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.879 
this car I can still adjust the sway
bars<00:06:02.030> where<00:06:02.539> I<00:06:02.570> want<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.380> them<00:06:03.530> to<00:06:03.740> I'm

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
bars where I want to them to I'm

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.320 
bars where I want to them to I'm
actually<00:06:04.159> pretty<00:06:04.490> happy<00:06:04.849> with<00:06:04.940> where<00:06:05.150> they're

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
actually pretty happy with where they're

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.909 
actually pretty happy with where they're
set<00:06:05.539> up<00:06:05.659> right<00:06:05.870> now<00:06:06.020> which<00:06:06.229> is<00:06:06.260> stiff<00:06:06.650> front

and<00:06:07.130> stiff<00:06:07.400> rear<00:06:07.930> but<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:08.960> might<00:06:09.169> play<00:06:09.320> that<00:06:09.349> a

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
and stiff rear but I might play that a

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.140 
and stiff rear but I might play that a
little<00:06:09.770> bit<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:09.889> little<00:06:10.550> bit<00:06:10.669> more<00:06:10.789> but<00:06:11.060> either

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150
