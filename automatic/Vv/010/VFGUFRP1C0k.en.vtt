for a number of reasons but basically to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.950 
for a number of reasons but basically to
keep<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.610> video<00:00:44.820> moving<00:00:45.360> along<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
keep this video moving along because I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.810 
keep this video moving along because I
