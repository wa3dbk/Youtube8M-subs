pieces you can see I'm doing angled

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.580 
pieces you can see I'm doing angled
wedges<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.430> think<00:00:18.300> it'll<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.510> look<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> little

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
wedges I think it'll just look a little

wedges I think it'll just look a little
cooler<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:22.730> was<00:00:23.730> planning<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.240> using<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140

brass<00:00:26.960> bolster<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:29.420> in<00:00:30.439> shaping<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:32.360> used<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.380 

tool<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.170> was<00:00:37.350> too<00:00:37.590> wide<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> doesn't

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tool that was too wide so now it doesn't

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.930 
tool that was too wide so now it doesn't
fit<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:41.899> lot<00:00:42.899> too<00:00:43.170> big<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> gap<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.219> what

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
fit it's a lot too big of a gap so what

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.190 
fit it's a lot too big of a gap so what
I<00:00:44.969> decided<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.780> instead<00:00:46.850> was<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.600> top

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I decided to do instead was have a top

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.049 
I decided to do instead was have a top
layer<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:51.680> stabilized<00:00:52.680> curly<00:00:53.039> birch<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
layer of stabilized curly birch and it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.740 
layer of stabilized curly birch and it's
glued<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> handle<00:00:56.390> there's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
glued up to the handle there's a bit of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.119 
glued up to the handle there's a bit of
an<00:00:57.840> issue<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.270> with<00:01:00.270> making<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:02.210> bolster

harding but with a few trials I finally

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
harding but with a few trials I finally
got<00:01:14.490> something<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> fit<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> glued<00:01:16.560> up

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
got something to fit you got a glued up

got something to fit you got a glued up
I<00:01:17.040> didn't<00:01:18.000> use<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> jig<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:19.189> held<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.400> place<00:01:21.290> by

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I didn't use a jig I held it in place by

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.980 
I didn't use a jig I held it in place by
hand<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> sort<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:24.380> make<00:01:25.380> shifted<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.990> clamp

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
hand and sort of make shifted a clamp

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.280 
hand and sort of make shifted a clamp
from<00:01:28.409> some<00:01:28.740> wood<00:01:28.920> clamps<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.689> but<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.810> worked

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
from some wood clamps and but it worked

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.420 
from some wood clamps and but it worked
out<00:01:31.439> good<00:01:32.270> I'll<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.479> show<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.280> what<00:01:35.280> it's

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
out good I'll just show you what it's

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
out good I'll just show you what it's
supposed<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.850> look<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.750> I've<00:01:36.869> decided

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
supposed to look like what I've decided

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.060 
supposed to look like what I've decided
to<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:40.280> vulcanized<00:01:41.280> fiber<00:01:43.070> leather

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
to do is go vulcanized fiber leather

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
to do is go vulcanized fiber leather
vulcanized<00:01:45.060> fiber<00:01:45.360> between<00:01:46.130> everything<00:01:48.320> so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
vulcanized fiber between everything so

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.249 
vulcanized fiber between everything so
that<00:01:49.470> it'll<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> three<00:01:50.909> piece<00:01:51.119> spacer

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.959 

then<00:01:55.850> from<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.600> won't<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.850> piece<00:01:59.850> of

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
then from there it won't be a piece of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.670 
then from there it won't be a piece of
rosewood

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.050
