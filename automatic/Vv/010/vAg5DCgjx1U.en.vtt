scientific literature but that's and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.530 
scientific literature but that's and
then<00:01:40.890> actually<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.400> graduate<00:01:41.880> school<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.180> just

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then actually in graduate school I just

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.149 
then actually in graduate school I just
kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> came<00:01:42.960> across<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.799> started

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
kind of came across them and started

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.880 
kind of came across them and started
picking<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> habit<00:01:45.000> again<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> way

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
picking up the habit again just as a way

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
picking up the habit again just as a way
of<00:01:46.950> relieving<00:01:47.280> stress<00:01:47.610> while<00:01:47.939> working<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> my

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of relieving stress while working on my

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.679 
of relieving stress while working on my
dissertation<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:51.240> stuck<00:01:51.479> with<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
dissertation and so I just stuck with it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
dissertation and so I just stuck with it
I<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.710> think<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> guilty

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I don't really think of it as a guilty

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
I don't really think of it as a guilty
pleasure<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.720> definitely<00:01:54.930> believe<00:01:55.380> in

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pleasure because I definitely believe in

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.289 
pleasure because I definitely believe in
guilty<00:01:55.920> pleasures<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> like

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
guilty pleasures like what you like

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
guilty pleasures like what you like
there's<00:01:57.689> no<00:01:57.810> reason<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> feel<00:01:58.350> guilty<00:01:58.560> about

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
there's no reason to feel guilty about

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.149 
there's no reason to feel guilty about
it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.280 
it
and<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.880> I've<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.030> been<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.360> fan<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and so I've just been a fan over the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
and so I've just been a fan over the
years<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.250> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> whole<00:02:02.579> point

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
years now it's kind of the whole point

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.310 
years now it's kind of the whole point
of<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.060> show<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> nitpick<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.780> science<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
of this show to nitpick the science and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.050 
of this show to nitpick the science and
technology<00:02:04.829> behind<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.219> film<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.670> Man<00:02:05.880> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
technology behind a film like Man of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
technology behind a film like Man of
Steel<00:02:06.299> for<00:02:06.329> example<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:07.950> really

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
Steel for example but I was really

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.219 
Steel for example but I was really
curious<00:02:08.520> could<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.390> changes<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> color<00:02:10.140> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
curious could the changes in color of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.059 
curious could the changes in color of
the<00:02:10.470> Sun<00:02:10.679> between<00:02:10.920> Krypton<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.580> Earth

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the Sun between Krypton and Earth

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.589 
the Sun between Krypton and Earth
the<00:02:12.189> gravity<00:02:12.609> really<00:02:12.999> makes<00:02:13.209> someone<00:02:13.390> like

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
the gravity really makes someone like

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.830 
the gravity really makes someone like
Superman<00:02:14.079> superhuman<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.890> some<00:02:15.069> extent<00:02:15.459> yes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Superman superhuman to some extent yes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.869 
Superman superhuman to some extent yes
when<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:16.930> go<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.139> the<00:02:17.349> moon<00:02:17.609> which<00:02:18.609> has<00:02:18.849> a

when we go to the moon which has a

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.879 
when we go to the moon which has a

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
our muscles and skeleton structure which

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.530

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
are adopted to Earth's gravity we're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.879 
are adopted to Earth's gravity we're
able<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:26.400> lift<00:02:27.400> moon<00:02:27.909> cars<00:02:28.329> overhead<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.260> leap

moon buildings in a single bound which

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.289 
moon buildings in a single bound which
astonished<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.689> moon<00:02:34.689> people<00:02:35.579> at<00:02:36.579> perhaps<00:02:37.120> it

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
astonished the moon people at perhaps it

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.470 
astonished the moon people at perhaps it
said<00:02:37.450> too<00:02:37.599> much<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.469> us<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:39.459> idea<00:02:39.939> was<00:02:40.239> with

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
said too much but us the idea was with

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.080 
said too much but us the idea was with
Superman<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:41.620> instead<00:02:42.159> of<00:02:42.340> us<00:02:42.549> going<00:02:42.909> to

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
Superman that instead of us going to

Superman that instead of us going to
another<00:02:43.329> planet<00:02:43.659> we<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:43.959> someone<00:02:44.349> from

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
another planet we have someone from

as<00:03:02.469> he<00:03:03.400> started<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.909> face<00:03:04.060> more<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.569> more

as he started to face more and more

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.080

powerful adversaries

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.530

he<00:03:07.419> gained<00:03:07.780> more<00:03:08.349> and<00:03:08.409> more<00:03:08.560> powers<00:03:09.040> himself

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
he gained more and more powers himself

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.300 
he gained more and more powers himself
until<00:03:10.540> eventually<00:03:10.780> they<00:03:11.260> changed<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.980> source

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
until eventually they changed the source

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.949 
until eventually they changed the source
of<00:03:12.549> his<00:03:12.639> powers<00:03:13.030> from<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.299> fact<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.689> earth

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
of his powers from the fact that earth

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.080 
of his powers from the fact that earth
has<00:03:14.169> a<00:03:14.199> week<00:03:14.439> of<00:03:14.590> gravity<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.699> the<00:03:15.790> fact<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
has a week of gravity to the fact that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.009 
has a week of gravity to the fact that
we<00:03:16.299> have<00:03:16.509> a<00:03:16.540> Yellow<00:03:16.930> Sun<00:03:16.979> Sol<00:03:18.540> whereas<00:03:19.540> Krypton

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
we have a Yellow Sun Sol whereas Krypton

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.449 
we have a Yellow Sun Sol whereas Krypton
has<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.349> red<00:03:20.650> Sun<00:03:20.949> Rao<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.970> yes<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.459> realized

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
has a red Sun Rao and yes I realized

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.550 
has a red Sun Rao and yes I realized
what<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.639> implies<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.359> know<00:03:25.419> that<00:03:25.569> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
what it implies that I know that and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.140 
what it implies that I know that and
that<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.889> exactly<00:03:27.129> why<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:27.639> were<00:03:27.819> having<00:03:28.060> you

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
that is exactly why we were having you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.409 
that is exactly why we were having you
on<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.389> show<00:03:28.419> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.900> exactly<00:03:29.409> and<00:03:29.739> uh<00:03:30.579> that

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
on the show this is exactly and uh that

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.599 
on the show this is exactly and uh that
shifted<00:03:32.019> wavelength<00:03:32.620> from<00:03:32.979> red<00:03:33.220> light<00:03:33.430> to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
shifted wavelength from red light to

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.349 
shifted wavelength from red light to
yellow<00:03:33.819> light<00:03:34.060> 80<00:03:34.419> nanometers<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:35.609> enough<00:03:36.609> to

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
yellow light 80 nanometers is enough to

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.420 
yellow light 80 nanometers is enough to
enable<00:03:37.930> someone<00:03:38.290> to<00:03:38.439> bend<00:03:38.769> steel<00:03:39.069> in<00:03:39.280> their

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
enable someone to bend steel in their

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.420 
enable someone to bend steel in their
bare<00:03:39.609> hands<00:03:40.049> so<00:03:41.049> then<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.949> started<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.310> become

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
bare hands so then it started to become

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.280 
bare hands so then it started to become
more<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.060> fantasy<00:03:43.540> one<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.109> things

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
more like a fantasy one of the things

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.719 
more like a fantasy one of the things
that<00:03:44.439> did<00:03:44.560> kind<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:44.859> drive<00:03:45.009> me<00:03:45.129> crazy<00:03:45.280> was

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
that did kind of drive me crazy was

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.729 
that did kind of drive me crazy was
Superman's<00:03:46.180> ability<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:46.750> fly<00:03:46.959> now<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.500> know

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
Superman's ability to fly now I know

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.319 
Superman's ability to fly now I know
that's<00:03:48.040> one<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.400> more<00:03:48.549> fantastical

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
that's one of the more fantastical

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.539 
that's one of the more fantastical
elements<00:03:49.479> of<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.989> film<00:03:50.229> but<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:50.829> do<00:03:50.979> get<00:03:51.489> that

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
elements of the film but I do get that

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.969 
elements of the film but I do get that
you<00:03:52.180> know<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.930> earth<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.560> gravity's

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979

then<00:03:56.379> he's<00:03:56.500> hovering<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:57.579> then<00:03:57.759> he's<00:03:57.939> in

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
then he's hovering and then he's in

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.759 
then he's hovering and then he's in

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:12.009 
unified theory of Superman's powers he

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.459 
unified theory of Superman's powers he
says<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.849> lot<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> what<00:04:13.689> Superman<00:04:14.229> does

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
says that a lot of what Superman does

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.039 
says that a lot of what Superman does
could<00:04:15.219> be<00:04:15.370> explained<00:04:15.819> if<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.269> grant<00:04:16.599> him<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
could be explained if you grant him the

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.689 
could be explained if you grant him the
miracle<00:04:17.530> exemption<00:04:18.039> from<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.219> laws<00:04:18.489> of

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
miracle exemption from the laws of

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.149 
miracle exemption from the laws of
nature<00:04:18.909> that<00:04:19.299> he's<00:04:19.719> able<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.109> control<00:04:20.289> inertia

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
nature that he's able to control inertia

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.969 
nature that he's able to control inertia
his<00:04:22.120> own<00:04:22.300> inertia<00:04:22.599> and<00:04:23.020> other<00:04:23.349> objects<00:04:23.889> in

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
his own inertia and other objects in

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.660 
his own inertia and other objects in
motion

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
motion

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.340 
motion
so<00:04:24.790> what<00:04:25.030> do<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.330> we<00:04:25.450> as<00:04:25.600> a<00:04:25.630> people<00:04:25.960> can

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
so what do you think we as a people can

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.320 
so what do you think we as a people can
do<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.620> be<00:04:26.830> more<00:04:26.860> Superman<00:04:27.640> like<00:04:27.880> whether<00:04:28.150> it

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
do to be more Superman like whether it

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.360 
do to be more Superman like whether it
be<00:04:28.510> biological<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.530> mechanical<00:04:29.620> or

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
be biological and mechanical or

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.400 
be biological and mechanical or
nanotechnology<00:04:30.880> how<00:04:31.720> can<00:04:31.870> we<00:04:31.930> be<00:04:32.080> more<00:04:32.350> like

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
nanotechnology how can we be more like

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.220 
nanotechnology how can we be more like
Superman<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.250> think<00:04:33.580> a<00:04:33.880> lot<00:04:34.390> of<00:04:34.420> it<00:04:34.690> there<00:04:34.900> there

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
Superman I think a lot of it there there

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.480 
Superman I think a lot of it there there
will<00:04:35.410> be<00:04:35.440> some<00:04:35.740> nanotech<00:04:36.310> there<00:04:36.670> will<00:04:36.880> be<00:04:36.910> some

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
will be some nanotech there will be some

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.460 
will be some nanotech there will be some
exoskeleton<00:04:39.490> type<00:04:39.700> suits<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.870> big<00:04:41.080> thing<00:04:41.320> is

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
exoskeleton type suits the big thing is

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.070 
exoskeleton type suits the big thing is
to<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.770> power<00:04:42.040> supply<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.240> run<00:04:43.420> it<00:04:43.570> I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
to have a power supply that can run it I

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.260 
to have a power supply that can run it I
know<00:04:44.530> we're<00:04:44.830> shifting<00:04:45.190> from<00:04:45.670> one<00:04:45.760> film<00:04:46.180> to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
know we're shifting from one film to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.270 
know we're shifting from one film to
another<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:46.750> when<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:46.990> consider<00:04:47.170> Iron<00:04:47.560> Man<00:04:47.890> a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
another but when you consider Iron Man a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.490 
another but when you consider Iron Man a
lot<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> technology<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.110> Iron<00:04:50.260> Man

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
lot of the technology in the Iron Man

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.860 
lot of the technology in the Iron Man
suit<00:04:50.560> exists<00:04:51.370> right<00:04:51.520> now<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.360> one<00:04:52.570> piece

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
suit exists right now the one piece

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.380 
suit exists right now the one piece
that's<00:04:53.050> missing<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:54.220> arc<00:04:54.430> reactor<00:04:54.700> this

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
that's missing is the arc reactor this

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.410 
that's missing is the arc reactor this
little<00:04:55.830> thing<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.860> sits<00:04:57.370> in<00:04:57.520> his<00:04:57.580> chest<00:04:57.910> that

little thing that sits in his chest that

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.180 
little thing that sits in his chest that
puts<00:04:58.660> out<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.900> power<00:04:59.110> of<00:04:59.380> about<00:04:59.590> 3<00:04:59.830> nuclear

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
puts out the power of about 3 nuclear

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.370 
puts out the power of about 3 nuclear
power<00:05:00.460> plants<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.720> about<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.990> size<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.290> a

power plants and is about the size of a

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.950 
power plants and is about the size of a
hockey<00:05:02.560> ball<00:05:02.910> if<00:05:03.910> we<00:05:04.090> knew<00:05:04.210> how<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.420> make<00:05:04.600> those

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
hockey ball if we knew how to make those

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.290 
hockey ball if we knew how to make those
we<00:05:05.380> wouldn't<00:05:05.650> need<00:05:05.770> superhero<00:05:06.430> all<00:05:06.970> right<00:05:07.090> Jim

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
we wouldn't need superhero all right Jim

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.850 
we wouldn't need superhero all right Jim
well<00:05:07.450> before<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.840> let<00:05:08.050> you<00:05:08.080> go<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.350> have<00:05:08.560> one

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
well before I let you go I have one

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.890 
well before I let you go I have one
final<00:05:09.130> question<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:09.880> that<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.360> if<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:10.750> could

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
final question and that is if you could
