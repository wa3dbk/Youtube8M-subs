the roof with the sniper rifle you land
down<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.049> did<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> at<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> point<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
down like I did and at this point you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.760

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
the base about two minutes after this

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.659 
the base about two minutes after this
because<00:04:25.260> we<00:04:25.380> had<00:04:25.470> one<00:04:25.650> person<00:04:26.160> left<00:04:26.310> behind
