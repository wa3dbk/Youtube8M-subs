00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.310 

it<00:03:15.330> goes<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:16.050> how<00:03:16.170> you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it goes like that and that's how you

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.320 
it goes like that and that's how you
play<00:03:16.440> every<00:03:16.860> single<00:03:17.220> verse<00:03:17.370> does<00:03:17.940> different

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
play every single verse does different

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.990 
play every single verse does different
words<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.950> have<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.130> second<00:03:20.520> verse<00:03:20.700> there

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
words so you have a second verse there

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.450 
words so you have a second verse there
and<00:03:21.300> then<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.080> goes<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.560> bridge<00:03:22.950> which
