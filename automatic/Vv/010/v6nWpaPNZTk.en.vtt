00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
these are legitimate it must be it's got
to<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.439> stressed<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.890> NSA<00:02:08.280> has<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:09.270> three

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
to be stressed that NSA has now three

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.920 
to be stressed that NSA has now three
missions<00:02:10.140> they've<00:02:10.649> always<00:02:10.860> had<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.610> mess

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
missions they've always had a mess

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.410 
missions they've always had a mess
of<00:02:12.170> basically<00:02:13.010> spying<00:02:13.459> on<00:02:13.700> foreign

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
of basically spying on foreign

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.709 
of basically spying on foreign
communications<00:02:15.379> since<00:02:16.450> 9/11<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.599> the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719

passage of the Patriot Act those lines

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.220 
passage of the Patriot Act those lines
now<00:02:19.939> between<00:02:20.359> what's<00:02:20.599> foreign<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.079> what's

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
now between what's foreign and what's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.309 
now between what's foreign and what's
domestic<00:02:21.829> have<00:02:22.280> basically<00:02:22.730> disappeared<00:02:23.540> they

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
domestic have basically disappeared they

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.949 
domestic have basically disappeared they
also<00:02:24.530> had<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.040> job<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:26.260> protecting<00:02:27.260> us

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
also had the job of protecting us

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.020 
also had the job of protecting us
message<00:02:29.959> traffic<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.829> secrets<00:02:31.459> with<00:02:31.670> by

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
creating our own cryptographic systems

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.929 
creating our own cryptographic systems
and<00:02:35.840> now<00:02:36.230> they're<00:02:36.439> in<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.769> role<00:02:37.189> of<00:02:37.400> cybers

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
and now they're in this role of cybers

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.099 
and now they're in this role of cybers
of<00:02:38.209> cyber<00:02:38.659> security<00:02:39.879> now<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.540> question<00:02:41.959> is

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
of cyber security now the question is

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.550 
of cyber security now the question is
what<00:02:42.709> constitutes<00:02:43.900> protective<00:02:44.900> information

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
what constitutes protective information

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.530 
what constitutes protective information
security<00:02:46.159> or<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.579> they<00:02:46.730> call<00:02:46.879> defensive

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
security or what they call defensive

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.619 
security or what they call defensive
information<00:02:48.169> warfare<00:02:49.099> operations<00:02:49.629> what's

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
information warfare operations what's

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.059 
information warfare operations what's
the<00:02:50.810> difference<00:02:51.200> between<00:02:51.409> that<00:02:51.799> and

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
the difference between that and

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.879 
the difference between that and
offensive<00:02:52.930> information<00:02:53.930> warfare<00:02:54.139> operations

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
offensive information warfare operations

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.800 
offensive information warfare operations
what<00:02:55.040> we're<00:02:55.189> looking<00:02:55.459> at<00:02:55.579> offense<00:02:56.000> yes<00:02:56.599> we're

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
what we're looking at offense yes we're

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.979 
what we're looking at offense yes we're
looking<00:02:56.959> at<00:02:57.290> NSA<00:02:58.099> hacking<00:02:59.030> into<00:02:59.419> systems

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
looking at NSA hacking into systems

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.069 
looking at NSA hacking into systems
reading<00:03:00.739> emails<00:03:01.239> looking<00:03:02.239> at<00:03:02.359> people<00:03:02.659> surfing

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
reading emails looking at people surfing

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.280 
reading emails looking at people surfing
habits<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.739> maybe<00:03:04.189> even<00:03:04.540> hijacking<00:03:05.540> websites

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
habits and maybe even hijacking websites

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.259 
habits and maybe even hijacking websites
to<00:03:06.709> put<00:03:06.919> their<00:03:07.069> own<00:03:07.099> information<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
to put their own information on the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.539 
to put their own information on the
websites<00:03:08.719> okay<00:03:09.169> so<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:09.919> sounds<00:03:10.099> like<00:03:10.189> what

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
websites okay so it sounds like what

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.220 
websites okay so it sounds like what
you're<00:03:10.639> telling<00:03:10.969> me<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.659> both<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
you're telling me is this is both a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.569 
you're telling me is this is both a
two-pronged<00:03:12.709> operation<00:03:13.250> where<00:03:13.430> it's<00:03:13.549> a

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
two-pronged operation where it's a

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.490 
two-pronged operation where it's a
defensive<00:03:14.030> measure<00:03:14.209> yes<00:03:14.569> that's<00:03:15.019> what<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
defensive measure yes that's what the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.409 
defensive measure yes that's what the
company<00:03:15.859> line<00:03:16.129> is<00:03:16.370> yes<00:03:16.699> this<00:03:16.879> is<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> defensive

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:17.419 
company line is yes this is a defensive

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.909 
company line is yes this is a defensive
measure<00:03:17.629> but<00:03:18.169> they<00:03:18.290> may<00:03:18.409> be<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.859> step

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
measure but they may be going a step

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.619 
measure but they may be going a step
further<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.909> playing<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.419> bit<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
further and playing a little bit of

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.330 
further and playing a little bit of
offense<00:03:21.079> with<00:03:21.169> this<00:03:21.409> and<00:03:21.620> trying<00:03:21.859> to<00:03:22.010> go<00:03:22.190> in

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
offense with this and trying to go in

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.119 
offense with this and trying to go in
and<00:03:22.609> in<00:03:22.760> perhaps<00:03:23.500> possibly<00:03:24.500> violate<00:03:24.859> people's

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
and in perhaps possibly violate people's

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.550 
and in perhaps possibly violate people's
privacy<00:03:25.459> well<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> issue<00:03:26.389> is<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.720> yes<00:03:27.319> they

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
privacy well the issue is that yes they

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.679 
privacy well the issue is that yes they
do<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.949> mission<00:03:28.400> now<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.269> director

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:29.689 
do have a mission now that the director

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:31.839 
do have a mission now that the director
of<00:03:29.720> NSA<00:03:29.989> has<00:03:30.470> also<00:03:30.680> been<00:03:30.979> named<00:03:31.159> by<00:03:31.340> President

thing okay well he said you heard that
right<00:03:44.930> here<00:03:45.049> from<00:03:45.229> Wayne<00:03:45.560> Matson<00:03:45.979> that<00:03:46.189> this

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
right here from Wayne Matson that this

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.979 
right here from Wayne Matson that this
sounds<00:03:46.849> like<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.389> more<00:03:47.569> than<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.930> a

sounds like this is more than just a

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.659 
sounds like this is more than just a
defensive<00:03:48.409> measure<00:03:48.560> for<00:03:49.159> what<00:03:49.250> between<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
defensive measure for what between the
