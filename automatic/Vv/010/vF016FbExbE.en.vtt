00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
going to have to obviously work on

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.069 
going to have to obviously work on
typically<00:04:18.090> when<00:04:18.269> they<00:04:18.389> come<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.690> with<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> belt

off<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:19.500> means<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> compressor<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.370> no

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
off that means the compressor is no

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.159 
off that means the compressor is no
