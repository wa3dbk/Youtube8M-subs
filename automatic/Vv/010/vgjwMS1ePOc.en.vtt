00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
game but it is very disappointing

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.070 
game but it is very disappointing
because<00:02:15.299> I've<00:02:15.420> been<00:02:15.450> waiting<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.870> long<00:02:15.900> time

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
because I've been waiting a long time

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.570 
because I've been waiting a long time
for<00:02:16.319> zombies<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.430> wait<00:02:17.549> a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
for zombies and if I have to wait a

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000 
for zombies and if I have to wait a
month<00:02:17.849> for<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.080> DLC<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> Xbox

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
month for you know the DLC on the Xbox

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.619 
month for you know the DLC on the Xbox
that's<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.459> be<00:02:20.580> really<00:02:20.849> really<00:02:20.970> devastating

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
that's to be really really devastating

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's to be really really devastating
so<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.080> really<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> best<00:02:23.760> bet

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
so I really do think that the best bet

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.509 
so I really do think that the best bet
would<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.659> the<00:02:24.900> equality<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:26.400> both

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
would be to do the equality for both

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.550 
would be to do the equality for both
consoles<00:02:26.970> let<00:02:27.239> both<00:02:27.480> consoles<00:02:27.840> get<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.140> DLC

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
consoles let both consoles get the DLC

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.500 
consoles let both consoles get the DLC
at<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> same<00:02:28.860> time<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.790> know<00:02:29.879> every<00:02:30.360> night

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
