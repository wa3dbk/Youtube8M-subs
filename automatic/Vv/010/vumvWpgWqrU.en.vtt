need to work with and I'm gonna start

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160 
need to work with and I'm gonna start
braiding<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.640> regular<00:02:36.030> Dutch<00:02:36.360> braid<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:36.930> kind

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
braiding a regular Dutch braid it's kind

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.840 
braiding a regular Dutch braid it's kind
of<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> same<00:02:37.740> way<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:37.980> French<00:02:38.460> braiding

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
of like the same way as French braiding

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.820 
of like the same way as French braiding
except<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.630> are<00:02:39.780> bringing<00:02:40.140> your<00:02:40.410> strands

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
except you are bringing your strands

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.100 
except you are bringing your strands
underneath<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:41.940> grabbed<00:02:42.270> three<00:02:42.600> strands

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
underneath so I grabbed three strands

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.170 
underneath so I grabbed three strands
and<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.590> braiding<00:02:44.400> them<00:02:44.700> underneath

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
and I'm just braiding them underneath

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.930 
and I'm just braiding them underneath
and<00:02:45.600> as<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.260> braid<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.800> add<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.610> bit<00:02:47.850> of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
and as I braid I add a little bit of

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.440 
and as I braid I add a little bit of
hair<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.390> each<00:02:48.690> strand<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:50.430> it's<00:02:50.580> very<00:02:50.850> simple

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
hair in each strand so it's very simple

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
hair in each strand so it's very simple
very<00:02:51.570> self-explanatory

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
very self-explanatory

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.280 
very self-explanatory
the<00:02:53.340> trick<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.390> braided<00:02:55.050> very

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the trick to this is to braided very

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.920 
the trick to this is to braided very
tightly<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.250> hold<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.180> your<00:02:57.270> strands

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
tightly and to hold on to your strands

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.560 
tightly and to hold on to your strands
if<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.740> are<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> little<00:02:59.520> rusty<00:03:00.210> with<00:03:00.240> your

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
if you are a little rusty with your

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690 
if you are a little rusty with your
braiding<00:03:00.990> skills<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.740> the<00:03:01.860> great<00:03:02.130> time

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
braiding skills this is the great time

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.390 
braiding skills this is the great time
to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.330> um<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:04.020> very<00:03:04.320> very<00:03:04.800> in<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
to do it um it's very very in for the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.890 
to do it um it's very very in for the
fall<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> think<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.300> just<00:03:06.390> looks<00:03:06.660> so

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
fall and I think it just looks so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.230 
fall and I think it just looks so
polished<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.530> well<00:03:07.680> put<00:03:07.860> together<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.940> again

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
polished and well put together so again

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.630 
polished and well put together so again
I'm<00:03:09.510> taking<00:03:09.870> my<00:03:10.020> strands<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:11.340> adding<00:03:11.610> a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I'm taking my strands and I'm adding a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.310 
I'm taking my strands and I'm adding a
little<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.030> hair<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.480> just<00:03:12.780> braiding<00:03:13.230> it

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
little bit of hair and just braiding it

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.850 
little bit of hair and just braiding it
underneath<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.580> creates<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.150> voluminous

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
underneath so it creates this voluminous

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.310 
underneath so it creates this voluminous
thicker<00:03:16.860> braid<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.550> top<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:18.390> could<00:03:18.690> braided

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
thicker braid on top you could braided

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.620 
thicker braid on top you could braided
the<00:03:19.470> regular<00:03:19.950> French<00:03:20.430> braid<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.420> think

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
the regular French braid but I think

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.540 
the regular French braid but I think
Dutch<00:03:21.810> braid<00:03:22.110> for<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.530> look<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:22.920> perfect<00:03:22.950> and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
Dutch braid for this look is perfect and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.390 
Dutch braid for this look is perfect and
we're<00:03:23.760> recreating<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.450> look<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.960> I<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.860> yeah

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
we're recreating a look so I think yeah

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.630 
we're recreating a look so I think yeah
it<00:03:26.610> looks<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.000> nice<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:29.280> I'm<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.520> gonna

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
it looks really nice so I'm just gonna

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.430 
it looks really nice so I'm just gonna
finish<00:03:29.940> our<00:03:30.180> braiding<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.900> finish<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.260> whole

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
finish our braiding and finish the whole

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:46.840 
finish our braiding and finish the whole
braid<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:32.130> secure<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.550> with<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.910> little

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.100 

you<00:03:47.850> would<00:03:48.060> go<00:03:48.540> hard<00:03:48.959> at<00:03:49.560> each<00:03:49.590> other<00:03:50.480> go<00:03:51.480> into

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
you would go hard at each other go into

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.900 
you would go hard at each other go into
so<00:03:52.470> I'm<00:03:52.530> gonna<00:03:52.740> do<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> other<00:03:53.160> part<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.700> again

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
so I'm gonna do the other part and again

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.640 
so I'm gonna do the other part and again
the<00:03:54.030> same<00:03:54.300> thing<00:03:54.360> I'm<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:55.140> starting<00:03:55.530> this

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the same thing I'm just starting this

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.729 
the same thing I'm just starting this
with<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> small<00:03:56.790> strand<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.330> hair<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.810> mean<00:03:58.380> three

with a small strand of hair I mean three
strands<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.430> just<00:03:59.610> braiding<00:04:00.030> them

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
strands and just braiding them

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.699 
strands and just braiding them
underneath<00:04:00.480> bringing<00:04:01.020> each<00:04:01.230> strand

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
underneath bringing each strand

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.400 
underneath bringing each strand
underneath<00:04:02.640> as<00:04:02.880> if<00:04:03.270> I<00:04:03.390> would<00:04:03.540> great<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> normal

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
underneath as if I would great a normal

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.470 
underneath as if I would great a normal
braid<00:04:04.650> except<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.370> bring<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.060> underneath<00:04:06.239> again

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
braid except I bring it underneath again

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.500 
braid except I bring it underneath again
and<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.319> just<00:04:07.500> keep<00:04:07.620> adding<00:04:07.830> hair<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.580> this

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
and I just keep adding hair and this

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.210 
and I just keep adding hair and this
side<00:04:09.750> actually<00:04:10.110> turned<00:04:10.320> out<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> lot<00:04:10.800> more<00:04:10.980> neat

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
side actually turned out a lot more neat

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440 
side actually turned out a lot more neat
because<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.550> had<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> little<00:04:12.000> bit<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.209> practice

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
because I had a little bit of practice

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.259 
because I had a little bit of practice
and<00:04:13.010> yeah<00:04:14.010> I'm<00:04:14.190> braiding<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.670> very<00:04:14.850> tightly

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and yeah I'm braiding it very tightly

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.930 
and yeah I'm braiding it very tightly
because<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.720> love<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.290> tight<00:04:16.530> look<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:17.669> still

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
because I love the tight look it's still

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.240 
because I love the tight look it's still
a<00:04:17.970> little<00:04:18.180> bit<00:04:18.390> messy<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.260> it's<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:20.040> such<00:04:20.220> a
