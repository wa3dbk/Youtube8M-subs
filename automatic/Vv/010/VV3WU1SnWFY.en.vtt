00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello dear tv viewer goes here from 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 you see her again the officejet pro 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 8000 100 children of hewlett packard or 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.670
 also just short called hp we want 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.740
 once show what it looks like now 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.380
 you got the printer that 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 unboxing you have already seen and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.420
 always want to prepare it 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.660
 for the first print ag supplies yes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 I say various things small things 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.930
 with which one would have to install before 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.340
 on the one hand it would be here that's 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.809
 namely, I say the drum and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.629
 on both sides the papers or the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.340
 Printing documents is environmental 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 if you stop everything so that you can 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 printed on both sides and not just one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 printed side and to the team has everything 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 always try to file it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.439
 Paper is precious paper both sides too 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 we turn it around 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.590
 there you see, I'll tell you here 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.570
 behind 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.479
 the entry of the empire bay where that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130
 then someone had to come around this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 Of course you would never have to do that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.509
 also this patridge-like part then 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.759
 use and that goes like this 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.900
 is actually always relatively easy 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.090
 make sure that up here are the two 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.500
 government history look up 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.500
 and then you put this in here 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.440
 until the topic parries it is now too 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.229
 May be partly paper jam may 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.240
 rhine newspaper print 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.729
 then you press the two buttons here 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.330
 and opens the door and can do that 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.220
 then take paper here if you can 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.750
 maybe want to transport upstairs 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 then both sides print times would 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.380
 then you press on it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.080
 scan both sides and it prefers 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 out again , so go back inside 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.790
 not very simple and arrested too 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.830
 Immediately so that you have the content too 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.840
 can use immediately 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.300
 what else do you need to prepare 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.050
 of course you have to paper on it 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.790
 insert 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.110
 There are indeed the demands 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.870
 shove it has a paper cassette of this 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.790
 printer and you can see it down here 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.260
 of course you should take care of that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 to pay attention that this whole 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.640
 transport lock as it still 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.230
 except with that one gets out of it 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 knit and then just remove 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.060
 and also this paper mache part 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:03.680
 and you can then me out then 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:12.110
 also put paper in the cassette so 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:15.950
 that a bit backwards 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:21.190
 put as the a4 paper should act 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.050
 you can stage it all beautifully 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.530
 already the cassette can come in again 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.930
 everything nicely protected from dust and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.970
 What else do I say trifles? 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.070
 that get into this paper rhine 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.830
 like animal hair, for example 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.350
 if someone pet owner is the one 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.510
 knows exactly what this is about 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.360
 what else do we have to install 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.300
 of course the chains ink cartridge 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.610
 the need to clean this we open 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.430
 then just shut up here 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.060
 and also the lower maintenance flap and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.340
 then you already know that here 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.110
 the sled there is the sled 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.720
 but is in the park position 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:13.450
 Therefore you have to always that one of the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:16.140
 Plug in electricity and also on 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.140
 wrinkles 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:40.069
 again to now comes so he bernd 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.849
 first up 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:50.099
 Here you can also see how that is 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:52.229
 moves everything short self check will 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.710
 here performed by the printer 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:59.340
 himself and he is now driving on the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.000
 sled as you see here before that 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.940
 you can use the cartridges 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.289
 the cartridges are all marked in color 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.440
 so that you can put the relatively simple into it 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:18.150
 You have to set short here 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:23.629
 make the banderole off and then you can 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:28.860
 you also want to use this way 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:35.069
 magenta comes in push this 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:43.740
 in here and then press again 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:48.090
 shortly thereafter yellow comes here 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.150
 then there and the big black 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.099
 cartouche comes here it's food 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.900
 safe and very easy if you have the 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:57.000
 wants to pull out cartridges again 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.219
 they even give again and the error 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.620
 The one in there sends the cartridge 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.320
 out you can 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.100
 we just take everything now 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.910
 close 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.979
 markus hirt that is also still gone he is 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.570
 the upper flap and can the lower 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.610
 flap about and now he should be a 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.580
 theoretically be ready 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:41.449
 The indicator jumps up and he 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:44.449
 says you also the levels as has 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:51.410
 he cleaned a bit and again 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:56.120
 So now it is actually pure 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:59.030
 theoretically finished and ready for use and 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.010
 could immediately start pushing like that 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.169
 we'll show you right in 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.960
 another video also how to do that 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.720
 half wlan set up and also printing 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.800
 then stop that in another 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.250
 video later 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.250
 see you soon
