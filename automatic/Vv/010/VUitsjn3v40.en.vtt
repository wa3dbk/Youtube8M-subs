00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.700
 yes, people my boxes and mine 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.719
 Subwoofer arrived today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:15.529
 these are the ones of trust gxt 38 I show 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.850
 Once again this is the subwoofer 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 Here you have several options once 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.340
 up here the volume so how loud and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.050
 here below 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.599
 the bancÃ© clear how much bass and here 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.420
 the one off switch is supposed to be the cable 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.790
 This will lead you through it all at once 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.890
 this box is on the left side 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.309
 stands 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 and here it is on the right side 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.809
 they are relatively easy here at two 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.440
 exits and back 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.550
 see me again where the whole 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 air I say now comes out 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.370
 and we have the subwoofer behind 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
 of course exactly like that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 then I would say I just do it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.570
 sometimes a song to such a two or three 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.870
 minutes 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.199
 and if you have any questions 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.199
 just in the comments 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.329
 and
