from the left corner or like where the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.500 
from the left corner or like where the
Neil<00:02:27.970> starts<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.360> grow<00:02:28.510> out<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.500> kind<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.890> just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
Neil starts to grow out and kind of just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.270 
Neil starts to grow out and kind of just
swoop<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.690> downwards<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.770> diagonal<00:02:33.220> line

so like that so just like going inverted

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.170 
so like that so just like going inverted
the<00:04:15.690> separate<00:04:16.190> direction<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:18.000> don't

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
the separate direction and you don't

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.580
