00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.209 
track of your hunts as well for some
reason<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:48.229> didn't<00:01:48.409> keep<00:01:48.530> track<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.770> mine<00:01:49.070> I

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
reason it didn't keep track of mine I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.700 
reason it didn't keep track of mine I
don't<00:01:49.430> know<00:01:49.520> why<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.079> I<00:01:51.079> have<00:01:51.289> already<00:01:51.439> played

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
don't know why but I have already played

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580 
don't know why but I have already played
this<00:01:51.860> game<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.990> some<00:01:53.990> reason<00:01:54.320> didn't<00:01:54.500> keep

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590

this game for some reason didn't keep
track<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.860> those<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.880> basically<00:01:56.210> you're<00:01:56.329> going

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
track of those so basically you're going
