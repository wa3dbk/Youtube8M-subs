00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.880
 with a recipe it's the recipe 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 waffles so it'll be chasms to 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.010
 both crispy fluffy to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
 inside and at the same time light you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.950
 see that this recipe is very 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.750
 easy to do you go right away 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.259
 adopt it because it is really very 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.730
 gourmet 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:35.700
 so if you like this recipe 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:42.149
 keep looking at this recipe he goes 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 you need 50 centilitres of the 50 g 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.609
 of butter 2 1/2 sachet of yeast and for 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.859
 the perfumes in all this is 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.269
 optional you will need the 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.170
 vanilla so I want to put some 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.429
 manu dress is a little bit of channel 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 so at first what are we going 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:04.370
 to do is we are going to separate the yellows 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.370
 whites 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.230
 so here's once you have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 do not increase work or whites in snow 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.890
 you're just going to the reserves and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.620
 put them aside you'll put 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.090
 so in your robot the flour the 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.170
 yeast 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.170
 with a little cinnamon 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.520
 I mix the powders in simple it is 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.920
 take them 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.110
 so your milk will put you in 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.240
 walk your robot on position 1 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.640
 if you do not have a robot you go 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.010
 simply add the milk as you go 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.010
 measure and you have to beat at the same time 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.320
 you will take your butter and you 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 go lemaitre in the microwave for 30 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.530
 seconds 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 so your butter at this consistency there 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.030
 So he issued me melt 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.459
 so you 're going to add the butter to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 good preparation and you to mix them 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.060
 for about five minutes so after 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.810
 five minutes so you must mix 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.700
 to have something homogeneous enough 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 of creamy enough finally and then we 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.489
 will end up adding the egg whites 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.489
 so I'm going to add but egg white 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:44.129
 and so here I'm going to gently stir 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.819
 with a rubber spatula in order to 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.200
 do not break the momentum simply 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.530
 and I mix it gently 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.530
 really give a side minus the lawyer 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.980
 and here's the recipe for mom's boxes 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.540
