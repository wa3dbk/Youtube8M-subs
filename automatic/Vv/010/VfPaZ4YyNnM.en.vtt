00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
makes sense and finally I have to come

00:00:46.590 --> 00:01:07.190 
makes sense and finally I have to come
to<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.610> with<00:01:04.909> no<00:01:05.930> thinking<00:01:06.930> about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to this and also with no thinking about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.190 
to this and also with no thinking about
what<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> how<00:01:07.799> does<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.040> mean<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> voice

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
what is it how does it mean to the voice

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.219 
what is it how does it mean to the voice
things<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.710> makes<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> sense<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.049> makes

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
things but makes it sense and it makes

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.950 
things but makes it sense and it makes
sense<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:14.159> repeat<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> repeat

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
sense because I repeat and if you repeat

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
sense because I repeat and if you repeat
something<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.830> audience<00:01:16.979> get<00:01:17.549> the

something the audience get the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.960 
something the audience get the
impressions<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.330> oh<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:19.080> he<00:01:19.229> repeats<00:01:19.759> then<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
impressions of oh if he repeats then it

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
impressions of oh if he repeats then it
must<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.240> something<00:01:21.450> he's<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.290> aware<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
must be something he's really aware of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.969 
must be something he's really aware of
