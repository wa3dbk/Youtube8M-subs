those two waves mesh up just right it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.260 
those two waves mesh up just right it
can<00:00:55.070> make<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.400> wave<00:00:55.610> that's<00:00:55.640> almost<00:00:55.970> twice<00:00:56.150> as

can't say
you<00:02:53.069> got

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.020 

it's<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.560> relatively<00:03:00.950> dangerous<00:03:01.310> spot<00:03:01.850> because

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's a relatively dangerous spot because

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.610 
it's a relatively dangerous spot because
it<00:03:02.240> breaks<00:03:02.390> an<00:03:02.600> extremely<00:03:03.050> shallow<00:03:03.230> water

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it breaks an extremely shallow water

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.440 
it breaks an extremely shallow water
it's<00:03:03.920> it's<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.460> Hawaii<00:03:04.850> or<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.150> places

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
it's it's not like Hawaii or the places

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
it's it's not like Hawaii or the places
where<00:03:05.570> does<00:03:05.690> break<00:03:05.960> on<00:03:06.140> a<00:03:06.170> reef<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.710> all<00:03:06.830> sand

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
where does break on a reef it's all sand

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.430 
where does break on a reef it's all sand
but<00:03:07.640> because<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.240> amount<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.840> energy<00:03:09.020> you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
but because of the amount of energy you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.530 
but because of the amount of energy you
have<00:03:09.470> focus<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.130> a<00:03:10.190> very<00:03:10.400> shallow<00:03:10.640> area<00:03:11.090> there

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
have focus in a very shallow area there

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.750 
have focus in a very shallow area there
have<00:03:11.720> been<00:03:11.870> quite<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.410> few<00:03:12.500> injuries<00:03:13.460> and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
have been quite a few injuries and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.650 
have been quite a few injuries and
occasional<00:03:14.320> fatalities<00:03:15.320> here<00:03:15.500> over<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:15.890> last

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
occasional fatalities here over the last

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.160 
occasional fatalities here over the last
40<00:03:17.660> or<00:03:17.720> 50<00:03:18.020> years

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.700 

nice

a<00:03:31.120> lot<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.150> days<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.450> wedge<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.600> just<00:03:32.900> flat

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
a lot of days the wedge is just flat

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.140 
a lot of days the wedge is just flat
like<00:03:33.500> any<00:03:33.680> other<00:03:33.860> surf<00:03:34.100> spot<00:03:34.430> but<00:03:34.640> here<00:03:34.850> when

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
like any other surf spot but here when

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.660 
like any other surf spot but here when
you<00:03:35.240> get<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> straight<00:03:36.050> south<00:03:36.350> swell<00:03:36.770> you<00:03:37.580> know

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
you get a straight south swell you know

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.640 
you get a straight south swell you know
over<00:03:38.030> about<00:03:38.360> four<00:03:38.630> or<00:03:38.690> five<00:03:38.780> feet<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.440> just

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
over about four or five feet it just

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.440 
over about four or five feet it just
starts<00:03:40.340> getting<00:03:40.550> bigger<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.000> bigger<00:03:41.150> and

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
starts getting bigger and bigger and

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.330 
starts getting bigger and bigger and
there's<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.290> lot<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.440> factors<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:42.950> have<00:03:43.160> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
there's a lot of factors that have to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.920 
there's a lot of factors that have to
come<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.940> swell<00:03:44.210> direction<00:03:44.660> has<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.870> be

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
come in the swell direction has to be

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.300 
come in the swell direction has to be
just<00:03:45.050> right<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.380> interval<00:03:45.800> between<00:03:45.950> the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
just right the interval between the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.220 
just right the interval between the
waves<00:03:46.460> has<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.180> be<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.420> right<00:03:47.570> amount<00:03:48.020> you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
waves has to be the right amount you

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.290 
waves has to be the right amount you
know<00:03:48.320> for<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.590> peak<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.700> come<00:03:49.850> together<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
know for the peak to come together the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.790 
know for the peak to come together the
way<00:03:50.330> you<00:03:50.450> want<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.900> but<00:03:51.110> when<00:03:51.530> all<00:03:51.650> those
