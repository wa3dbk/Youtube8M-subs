our gear and it's not the elite conquest

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
our gear and it's not the elite conquest

gear so first of all let's cover the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.080 
gear so first of all let's cover the
warrior<00:00:19.500> I've<00:00:19.680> got<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.010> say<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:20.640> this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
warrior I've got to say I think this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.830 
warrior I've got to say I think this
thing<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.650> bloody<00:00:22.650> amazing<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.400> fact<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.210> prefer

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
thing is bloody amazing in fact I prefer

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.339 
thing is bloody amazing in fact I prefer
it<00:00:25.199> quite<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.180> PVE<00:00:27.630> equivalent

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it quite a bit over the PVE equivalent

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.810 
it quite a bit over the PVE equivalent
and<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> main<00:00:29.039> reasons<00:00:29.550> for

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and I think one of the main reasons for

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.060 
and I think one of the main reasons for
that<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.840> eyes<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> helm<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.859> think

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that is the eyes on the helm I think

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.280 
that is the eyes on the helm I think
that<00:00:32.219> looks<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.850> cool<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> helm<00:00:34.020> does

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that looks really cool now the helm does

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.100 
that looks really cool now the helm does
have<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.890> giant<00:00:35.520> big<00:00:35.850> tusk<00:00:36.239> thing<00:00:36.690> at<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
have this giant big tusk thing at the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.740 
have this giant big tusk thing at the
top<00:00:37.320> which<00:00:38.160> okay<00:00:38.820> maybe<00:00:39.030> that's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.329> bit

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
top which okay maybe that's a little bit

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530 
top which okay maybe that's a little bit
unfortunate<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.040> they're<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.610> task<00:00:41.879> blade<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
unfortunate but they're not task blade I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
unfortunate but they're not task blade I
still<00:00:43.140> think<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.649> does<00:00:43.890> look<00:00:44.190> rather

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
still think that it does look rather

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.110 
still think that it does look rather
cool<00:00:44.940> though<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.370> overall<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
cool though and overall I just think the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.459 
cool though and overall I just think the
coloring<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> various

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
coloring of this and the various

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
coloring of this and the various
different<00:00:49.739> recolors<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.780> well

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
different recolors do look really well

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.689 
different recolors do look really well
actually<00:00:52.500> there's<00:00:52.829> something<00:00:53.250> about<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
actually there's something about it that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.970 
actually there's something about it that
looks<00:00:53.910> menacing<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.809> certainly<00:00:55.530> looks<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
looks menacing it certainly looks like a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.490 
looks menacing it certainly looks like a
pvp<00:00:56.579> piece<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> looks<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
pvp piece in that it looks like it's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.920 
pvp piece in that it looks like it's
very<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:58.920> designed<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.760> killing<00:01:00.510> people

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
very much designed for killing people

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.080 
very much designed for killing people
which<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.129> mean<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.460> don't<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.760> killing<00:01:02.969> people

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
which I mean I don't like killing people

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
which I mean I don't like killing people
in<00:01:03.420> real<00:01:03.570> life<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.350> games<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.949> bloody<00:01:05.339> well

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
in real life but in games I bloody well

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
in real life but in games I bloody well
love<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.750> terms<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> other<00:01:07.229> things

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
love it now in terms of other things

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
love it now in terms of other things
well<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.310> rather<00:01:08.610> similar<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.540> many<00:01:09.810> regards

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
well it's rather similar in many regards

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.090 
well it's rather similar in many regards
to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.420> PVE<00:01:12.420> equivalent<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> look<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.770> say

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to the PVE equivalent if you look at say

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.969 
to the PVE equivalent if you look at say
the<00:01:14.729> fee<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.689> arms<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> maybe<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> chest

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the fee and the arms and maybe the chest

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
the fee and the arms and maybe the chest
plate<00:01:17.280> they're<00:01:17.549> sort<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.880> similar<00:01:18.150> i<00:01:18.509> think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
plate they're sort of similar i think

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
plate they're sort of similar i think
that<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.770> shoulders<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.520> bit

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that the shoulders are a little bit

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.940 
that the shoulders are a little bit
different<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:21.990> nice<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.799> i

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
different so it's nice to see them i

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.530 
different so it's nice to see them i
think<00:01:22.979> they're<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:23.880> warrior

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
think they're actually very warrior

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
think they're actually very warrior
fitting<00:01:24.990> shoulders<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.890> often<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.580> sort<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
fitting shoulders I know often I sort of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
fitting shoulders I know often I sort of
speak<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.509> against<00:01:27.990> ridiculously<00:01:28.590> large

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
speak out against ridiculously large

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
speak out against ridiculously large
ones<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.280> think<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> totally<00:01:30.060> okay<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
ones I think it's totally okay in a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
ones I think it's totally okay in a
warrior<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.009> sake<00:01:32.400> la

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
warrior it's just the little sake la

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.859 
warrior it's just the little sake la
fille<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.479> makes<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.840> much

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
fille I don't think it makes as much

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.300 
fille I don't think it makes as much
sense<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.560> crazy<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.100> their

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
sense to have crazy to all their

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
sense to have crazy to all their
shoulders<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.119> for<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> warrior<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
shoulders but for a warrior you like you

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
shoulders but for a warrior you like you
want<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.579> giant

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
want to make them look like some giant

I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.030> blizzard<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.770> belt<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I think blizzard want to do the belt is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.880 
I think blizzard want to do the belt is
a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.790> too<00:01:44.970> big<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.899> whatever<00:01:46.799> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
a little bit too big but whatever I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
a little bit too big but whatever I
think<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.430> down<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.149> they

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
think that's just down to the way they

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
think that's just down to the way they
do<00:01:48.479> belts<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
do belts and that it's kind of just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.609 
do belts and that it's kind of just
bolted<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> waist<00:01:51.750> anyway<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.590> that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bolted on to the waist anyway with that

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.030 
bolted on to the waist anyway with that
done<00:01:52.950> let's<00:01:53.130> look<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.970> Paladin<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.500> one

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little disclaimer this is a very rough

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
little disclaimer this is a very rough
model<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.060> with

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
model and you can see there just with

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.310 
model and you can see there just with
the<00:02:00.270> back<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.659> head<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.110> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
helm goes on not really done but I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.330 
helm goes on not really done but I
thought<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.290> least<00:02:04.530> complete<00:02:05.040> enough

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
thought it was at least complete enough

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
thought it was at least complete enough
to<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> make<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.780> worth<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.320> showing

looked really evil and menacing that I

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.340 
looked really evil and menacing that I
loved<00:02:35.830> but<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> lot<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> people<00:02:37.330> didn't<00:02:37.960> seem<00:02:38.170> to

like<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.560> because<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:39.070> didn't<00:02:39.280> look<00:02:39.370> like<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
like it because it didn't look like a

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.770 
like it because it didn't look like a
paladin<00:02:40.140> honestly<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> way<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.530> see<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
paladin honestly the way I see it is a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.990 
paladin honestly the way I see it is a
paladin<00:02:43.780> pvp<00:02:44.020> set<00:02:44.710> should<00:02:45.190> look<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.430> some<00:02:45.880> of

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.470 
things are done in that name and it's
cool<00:02:56.560> if<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.040> piece<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.280> gear<00:02:57.610> reflects<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.150> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
cool if a piece of gear reflects that I

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.090 
cool if a piece of gear reflects that I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
think you see a lot of games that have

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.190 
think you see a lot of games that have
got<00:03:00.220> Crusaders<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.940> them<00:03:01.150> have<00:03:01.540> like<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
got Crusaders in them have like some of

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.840 
got Crusaders in them have like some of
those<00:03:02.290> crazy<00:03:02.560> Madison<00:03:03.130> Helms<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.520> various

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
those crazy Madison Helms and various

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.580 
those crazy Madison Helms and various
things<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:05.080> then<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.350> just

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
things like that and but then this just

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.170 
things like that and but then this just
sort<00:03:05.740> of<00:03:05.890> arched<00:03:06.310> up<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.550> little<00:03:06.820> bit<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
sort of arched up a little bit and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.850 
sort of arched up a little bit and
amplify<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.380> make<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.530> look<00:03:08.650> even

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
amplify it just to make it look even

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.400 
amplify it just to make it look even
more<00:03:09.130> evil<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:09.940> think<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.360> looks<00:03:10.840> really

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
more evil and I think that looks really

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.040 
more evil and I think that looks really

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
things that are being twisted so the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.240

light stuff it that's great yeah healing

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.610 
light stuff it that's great yeah healing
but<00:03:33.010> for<00:03:33.340> PvP<00:03:33.970> if<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.810> that's<00:03:34.989> like<00:03:35.200> that

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
but for PvP if it that's like that

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.530 
but for PvP if it that's like that
supposedly<00:03:36.459> good<00:03:36.700> things<00:03:36.970> being<00:03:37.239> twisted

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
supposedly good things being twisted

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.560 
supposedly good things being twisted
made<00:03:38.080> violent<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.739> stuff<00:03:38.920> then<00:03:39.489> or<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.420> least

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
made violent and stuff then or at least

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.210 
made violent and stuff then or at least
no<00:03:40.810> well<00:03:41.050> maybe<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.350> evil<00:03:41.709> violin<00:03:41.980> whatever

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
no well maybe just evil violin whatever

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.710 
no well maybe just evil violin whatever
then<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> think<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.090> actually<00:03:43.209> works<00:03:43.600> really

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
then I think it actually works really

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.530 
then I think it actually works really
well<00:03:44.019> if<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.530> bit<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.830> gear<00:03:45.130> for<00:03:45.760> paladin<00:03:46.180> looks

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
well if a bit of gear for paladin looks

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.540 
well if a bit of gear for paladin looks
a<00:03:46.690> bit<00:03:46.810> more<00:03:46.870> dark<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.590> menacing<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.430> things

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
a bit more dark and menacing and things

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.120 
a bit more dark and menacing and things
like<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:49.080> now<00:03:50.080> in<00:03:50.560> terms<00:03:50.769> of<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.980> piece

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
like that now in terms of the piece

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.070 
like that now in terms of the piece
itself<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:51.910> think<00:03:52.300> shoulders<00:03:52.630> are<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:52.840> cool

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
itself I think shoulders are really cool

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.320 
itself I think shoulders are really cool
I<00:03:53.260> like<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.530> white<00:03:53.680> light<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.370> can<00:03:54.730> reminds<00:03:55.120> me

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
I like the white light it can reminds me

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.390 
I like the white light it can reminds me
of<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.050> darker<00:03:56.350> sets<00:03:56.590> for<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:56.920> crusader

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
there's that I'm just looking at the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.100 
there's that I'm just looking at the
rest<00:04:05.650> of<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:05.890> guy<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.580> mean<00:04:07.390> he's<00:04:07.630> looking

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
rest of this guy I mean he's looking

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.949 
rest of this guy I mean he's looking
looking<00:04:08.680> pretty<00:04:08.890> good<00:04:09.209> unfortunately<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
looking pretty good unfortunately it

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.870 
looking pretty good unfortunately it
just<00:04:11.019> looks<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.530> little<00:04:11.680> bit<00:04:11.950> bland<00:04:12.280> from<00:04:12.640> some

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
just looks a little bit bland from some

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120 
just looks a little bit bland from some
angles<00:04:13.090> though<00:04:13.989> I'd<00:04:14.110> imagine<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.769> once<00:04:14.980> the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
angles though I'd imagine that once the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.409 
angles though I'd imagine that once the
spell<00:04:15.310> effects<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.760> shoulder<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.209> fully

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
spell effects on the shoulder is fully

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.099 
spell effects on the shoulder is fully
working<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:17.169> will<00:04:17.380> be<00:04:17.620> less<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.220> problem

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
working that will be less of a problem

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.810 
working that will be less of a problem
also<00:04:20.109> i'm<00:04:20.200> not<00:04:20.350> particularly<00:04:21.280> sure<00:04:21.520> about<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
also i'm not particularly sure about the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.740 
also i'm not particularly sure about the
blue<00:04:22.060> that's<00:04:22.390> here<00:04:22.840> on<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.169> legs

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
blue that's here on the legs

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.300 
blue that's here on the legs
doesn't<00:04:24.080> seem<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.290> fit<00:04:24.410> with<00:04:24.470> raster<00:04:24.770> set<00:04:25.130> I

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
doesn't seem to fit with raster set I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.120 
doesn't seem to fit with raster set I
don't<00:04:25.490> know<00:04:25.580> if<00:04:25.730> that<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.150> problem<00:04:26.330> on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
don't know if that is a problem on

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.710 
don't know if that is a problem on
animal<00:04:28.130> champions<00:04:28.610> front<00:04:28.850> in<00:04:28.970> terms<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.390> the

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
animal champions front in terms of the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.900 
animal champions front in terms of the
model<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.530> has<00:04:30.650> been<00:04:30.800> data<00:04:30.980> mind<00:04:31.280> but<00:04:31.880> I

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
model that has been data mind but I

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.030 
model that has been data mind but I
think<00:04:32.360> overall<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.050> promising<00:04:33.530> set<00:04:33.770> I

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
think overall this is a promising set I

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.590 
think overall this is a promising set I
know<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.730> lot<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:34.970> people<00:04:35.090> are<00:04:35.390> probably

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
know that a lot of people are probably

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.750 
know that a lot of people are probably
going<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.170> like<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:36.860> for<00:04:37.160> some<00:04:37.370> reason

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
going to not like it but for some reason

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.930 
going to not like it but for some reason
it<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.060> seems<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:39.230> just<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.340> work<00:04:40.520> out<00:04:40.700> pretty

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.910 
it just seems to just to work out pretty
well<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.210> me<00:04:41.660> with<00:04:42.110> all<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.440> said<00:04:42.500> though
