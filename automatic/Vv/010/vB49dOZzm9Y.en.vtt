up it's odd when you move this leg it's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.270 
up it's odd when you move this leg it's
fine<00:04:02.269> right<00:04:02.630> let<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:03.500> leg<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.980> other<00:04:04.010> one

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
fine right let this leg the other one

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.150 
fine right let this leg the other one
comes<00:04:04.519> up<00:04:04.670> with<00:04:04.880> it<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.620> that's<00:04:06.620> just<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.920> fluke

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
comes up with it and that's just a fluke

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.220 
comes up with it and that's just a fluke
online<00:04:07.609> but<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.570> know<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.930> like<00:04:09.079> it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
online but you know that like it

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.319 
online but you know that like it
separate<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:10.340> light<00:04:10.609> they<00:04:10.760> both<00:04:10.790> live

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.380 

without<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.930> rotate<00:04:15.590> don't<00:04:16.310> move<00:04:16.430> back<00:04:16.700> bend

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
without and rotate don't move back bend

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.789 
without and rotate don't move back bend
at<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:17.570> knee

at the knee

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.320 
at the knee
so<00:04:19.759> fairly<00:04:20.359> good<00:04:20.810> articulation<00:04:21.139> I<00:04:22.120> must<00:04:23.120> say

so fairly good articulation I must say

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.760 
so fairly good articulation I must say
that<00:04:23.539> better<00:04:23.960> than<00:04:24.229> the<00:04:24.379> ultimate

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
that better than the ultimate

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.480 
that better than the ultimate
