about<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.219> suppose<00:01:45.719> half<00:01:46.719> an<00:01:46.899> hour<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.490> what<00:01:48.640> at

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
about I suppose half an hour and what at

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.319 
about I suppose half an hour and what at
first<00:01:48.759> seemed<00:01:49.479> hard<00:01:50.259> work<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:52.060> once<00:01:52.240> you

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
first seemed hard work actually once you

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.010 
first seemed hard work actually once you
get<00:01:52.479> into<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.689> rhythm<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.340> over<00:01:54.520> these<00:01:54.700> weight

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
get into a rhythm and over these weight

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.490 
get into a rhythm and over these weight
it's<00:01:56.020> actually<00:01:56.170> quite<00:01:56.500> easy<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:59.079> don't<00:01:59.109> have

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
it's actually quite easy you don't have
