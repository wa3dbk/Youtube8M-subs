00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 good guys welcome a new 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.200
 gt5 video online here we are from 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.819
 back with the subscriber and how is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
 I understand then we have here in a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.690
 world wide which it has just 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.400
 catch bad and I think we all have 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.370
 seen it needs to be said they are very 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.599
 guys back in which bright and 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.160
 come on start recording a little maybe 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 because it is capital program of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 recording as usual as usual 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 the case is that it is worth 30 points of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 control and I'm a bit behind because 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 There are people who are already down on the ground 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.949
 that will not be down in the sky is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.240
 to have been would be up that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.790
 you understand, you do not have to say it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 either the case does not reach the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 account that they did not effectively avoid 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.950
 all palliate me now how do I rise now 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 what do I do with my life now I eat 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 climb up anime to if it was a car 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.129
 kan groups could go up but as not 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.379
 I'm supposed to take over here and already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.730
 to try to catch a little bit 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 I wanted to give a bump to the one who comes 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.449
 that's why the first one is 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 going there but well I tell you that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.059
 because by raising it the minimum for what 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 better than not set at the minimum of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 they will go and then we will say but the case 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.880
 the first one is going to be somewhat complicated 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.700
 catch him because he's chosen but 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.700
 not impossible madryn and go food 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.220
 as a boy I see it quite profitably 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.820
