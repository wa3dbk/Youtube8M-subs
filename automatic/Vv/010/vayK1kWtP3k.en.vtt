00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:11.460
 [Music] 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.990
 hello to all the boys a panic salute 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.660
 and welcome back to this new video on 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.029
 series best way destiny funds is a series 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.669
 that you are appreciating a lot that you don't 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.040
 bring some and then today I thought 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.259
 good to return a little bit to 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.550
 talk about destiny as i have 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.129
 said a while ago it is something that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.239
 interested enough and does me a lot 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.700
 pleasure just this is a game that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.930
 I will take a long time on my channel you today 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.390
 I show a weapon that was me 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.950
 asked I was asked by some of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.880
 you bring in my review 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.710
 that is hard light this is a weapon I have 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.690
 obtained in the first week of play 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.690
 of destinies once mine is completed 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.640
 first night falls and I used a lot 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.660
 very little and now I will explain to you 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.020
 I will explain why 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.710
 first I tell you this series 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.869
 will be structured with the game cram ie 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.390
 this square you see in the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.189
 screen where it will pass a gameplay that 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.280
 I did these weapons in such a way as to see 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.579
 also in a practical way how it behaves 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.959
 the weapon in game while we talk about it 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.649
 I told myself hard light automatic rifle 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:23.920
 which, however, I classify among the 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:27.909
 machine gun then the smg in short 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.880
 those of assault weapons with very little 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.090
 stability with a lot of cadence and impact 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.159
 very very low output this because 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.539
 have a very strong rate of fire e 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.020
 they are weapons that should be used mainly 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.890
 in melee or in any case with 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.829
 with nearby enemies it is excellent both in pvp 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.409
 excellent in short is a good weapon both in 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.469
 pvp that on TV and depends on the situation 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.509
 where you are I use it more for the 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.130
 pvp because for the pve at high levels 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.009
 go at enemies so i hope it is 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.679
 nearby is not very advisable also 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.810
 if arrived at some point in the 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.280
 weapon upgrade will have little 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.200
 recoil so you can also use it from 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.910
 distances a little bit more but the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.010
 little range the little impact of it 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.720
 affect a little efficiency neither 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.829
 to see now what are i 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.760
 upgrade the classics in detail 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:24.670
 so the first ones change 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.380
 impact increase of recoil here bava a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.980
 your discretion I put it here in 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.630
 half because you love recoil decreases e 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000
 it penalizes the range but I don't 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.930
 it also affects this though 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.519
 fairly good that the increase 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.870
 little about the impact by decreasing in the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.970
 stability goes here a little bit the time 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.560
 of at your discretion glass half 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.360
 full instead the lower half of each 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.430
 loader inflicts much more damage 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.810
 useful then we have the three here 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.459
 upgrade a little bit more 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.870
 then important and fast station 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.319
 this weapon can be extracted with more 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 speed 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.410
 whose perfect book this armor 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.569
 extremely small recoil this is a 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.310
 upgrade that I recommend or 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.359
 capacity but increased not there 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.030
 interest 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.440
 the last upgrade which is the one in 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.510
 detail of the weapon that the bullets 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.220
 fired from this weapon they penetrate into 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.959
 depth the target bounce on 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.910
 hard surfaces so let's say that 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.540
 you can get a lot of core from 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.190
 collateral firing against the i 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.810
 your enemies I repeat this is a weapon 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.750
 which you see I have used very little 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.579
 because I prefer to use other weapons i 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.139
 reasons are very simple as I have 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.730
 just explained that it is a weapon 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.810
 very limited from the point of view of 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.400
 range of recoil and of and 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.139
 precision obviously because having 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.430
 very much recoil and being a lot 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.870
 very wobbly limits limits a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.519
 I like its potential a little bit 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.470
 very much this very simple skin and 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.060
 elegant of the Rome also the viewfinder is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.650
 very very good from the point of view 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.650
 aesthetic as you can see here in the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.030
 bottom box where I'm playing and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.069
 so me 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.810
 I recommend it if you find it 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.640
 play with it a little for fun though it has 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.430
 core gete presto that has big 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.410
 limits that unfortunately compared to 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.120
 other weapons make it more than anything else 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.180
 fun toy to use every 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.590
 much but nothing important and incisive 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.690
 to use in the most difficult moments 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.280
 I used it sometimes doing the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.650
 glass vault when I threw myself in 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.910
 half I goblin to kill them in 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.950
 little time rather than maybe even 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.470
 with the minotaurs to make them immediately as much 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.030
 so much damage closely in some 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.889
 special situations when already maybe 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.950
 they didn't have the shield so I repeat it is 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.780
 a weapon not very versatile because its 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.600
 features really limit it 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.370
 a certain type of gameplay is fun 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.230
 sometimes it will make you nervous 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.630
 because you will notice that he has big ones 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.950
 big limits let me know what it is 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.630
 think below in the comments of 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.640
 this weapon if you have it if you have 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.020
 intention of buying it when 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 maybe it will be sold by xoom 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.720
 in short, whatever comes to mind 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.340
 su destiny on the weapon in question of 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.660
 video let me know below us there 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.450
 we see the next episode where there is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.610
 I will carry a legendary primary weapon 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.290
 a very strong greeting from panic e 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.650
 appointment to the next video ciao 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.650
 boys
