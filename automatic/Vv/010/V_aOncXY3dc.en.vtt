do<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.100> spent<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.550> last

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
do this and I have just spent the last

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
do this and I have just spent the last
three<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.239> four<00:00:48.360> hours<00:00:48.870> rattling<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.739> brain

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
three or four hours rattling my brain

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
three or four hours rattling my brain
about<00:00:50.280> how<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.020> my

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
about how to do this and I will get my

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
about how to do this and I will get my
revenge<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.710> cube<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.270> was<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
revenge on cube because this was really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
revenge on cube because this was really
difficult<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.059> people

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
difficult for me and for some people

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
difficult for me and for some people
it's<00:00:57.480> easy<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.109> didn't<00:00:58.500> get<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.579> anyway

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
it's easy but I didn't get it so anyway

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.250 
it's easy but I didn't get it so anyway
I'm<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.510> prove<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.050> actually

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I'm going to prove that I can actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
I'm going to prove that I can actually
solve<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> maybe<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.699> watching<00:01:03.030> media

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
solve this and maybe by watching media

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
solve this and maybe by watching media
you'll<00:01:03.719> figure<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.199> yourself<00:01:04.790> but<00:01:05.790> then

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you'll figure it out yourself but then

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.200 
you'll figure it out yourself but then
these<00:01:06.890> these<00:01:07.890> dice<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> while<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
these these dice can take a while to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
these these dice can take a while to
roll<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.840> while<00:01:10.500> they're<00:01:10.680> rolling<00:01:11.040> I'll

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
roll so while they're rolling I'll

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.960 
roll so while they're rolling I'll
probably<00:01:11.369> skip<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> video<00:01:13.880> there<00:01:14.880> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
probably skip that on the video there we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
probably skip that on the video there we
go<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.390> dice<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> stop<00:01:16.080> rolling<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.009> I'm

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
go the dice of stop rolling and now I'm

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
go the dice of stop rolling and now I'm
going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> solve<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.909> puzzle<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:19.110> I'm<00:01:19.200> just

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
going to solve this puzzle so I'm just

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.690 
going to solve this puzzle so I'm just
going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> make<00:01:20.189> sure<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going to look at and make sure that I

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.039 
going to look at and make sure that I
get<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:23.479> okay<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.020> know

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
get this right okay and I think I know

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.210 
get this right okay and I think I know
the<00:01:25.290> answer<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:26.030> believe<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.020> number<00:01:28.320> 8

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.280 

so<00:01:33.850> let's<00:01:34.120> see<00:01:34.330> we<00:01:34.480> have<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.690> press<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.050> button

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
so let's see we have to press the button

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.810 
so let's see we have to press the button
in<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.560> middle<00:01:37.800> and<00:01:38.800> yeah<00:01:39.070> there<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.430> go<00:01:39.460> is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
in the middle and yeah there you go is

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.740 
in the middle and yeah there you go is
the<00:01:40.000> number<00:01:40.240> 8<00:01:40.390> so<00:01:41.290> let's<00:01:41.500> do<00:01:41.650> this<00:01:41.770> again<00:01:42.070> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.660 

dice<00:01:46.750> have<00:01:46.960> stopped<00:01:47.200> rolling<00:01:47.410> again<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.400> now

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
dice have stopped rolling again so now

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.990 
dice have stopped rolling again so now
I'm<00:01:48.940> going<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.240> figure<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:49.990> out<00:01:50.970> ok<00:01:51.970> I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
I'm going to figure this one out ok I

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.800 
I'm going to figure this one out ok I
think<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.420> know<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.660> answer<00:01:52.690> again<00:01:53.260> is<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
think I know the answer again is the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.020 
think I know the answer again is the
number<00:01:56.140> six<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.370> that's<00:01:57.550> entertaining<00:02:00.030> let's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
number six so that's entertaining let's

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.960 
number six so that's entertaining let's
find<00:02:01.300> out<00:02:01.450> if<00:02:01.540> I'm<00:02:01.660> right<00:02:05.550> there<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:06.790> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
find out if I'm right there we go the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.919 
find out if I'm right there we go the
number<00:02:07.210> six<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.020> three<00:02:08.649> more<00:02:08.830> times<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.610> then

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
number six so three more times and then

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.370 
number six so three more times and then
I<00:02:10.929> become<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.320> member<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.890> secret<00:02:12.190> society

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I become a member of the secret society

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.930 
I become a member of the secret society
the<00:02:14.380> dice<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.800> stopped<00:02:15.040> rolling<00:02:15.250> again<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the dice have stopped rolling again and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.199 
the dice have stopped rolling again and
yeah<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.550> know<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> answer<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.180> that

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
yeah I think I know the answer to that

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.370 
yeah I think I know the answer to that
one<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.750> think<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.500> number<00:02:20.800> four<00:02:22.380> so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
one I think it's the number four so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.730 
one I think it's the number four so
let's<00:02:23.560> find<00:02:23.770> out<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.070> I'm<00:02:24.190> right<00:02:24.400> again<00:02:25.740> press

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
let's find out if I'm right again press

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.990 
let's find out if I'm right again press
the<00:02:26.950> button<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:27.459> in<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.640> middle<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.760> there

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the button here in the middle and there

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.870 
the button here in the middle and there
we<00:02:31.120> go<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.420> number<00:02:31.720> four<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.850> thing

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
we go it's number four so same thing

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.340 
we go it's number four so same thing
again<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:36.060> there<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.180> go<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.630> Dyson<00:02:38.110> finish

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
again and there we go the Dyson finish

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.150 
again and there we go the Dyson finish
rolling<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.480> yeah<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.780> think<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.830> number

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
rolling and yeah I think it's the number

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.650 
rolling and yeah I think it's the number
16<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.600> let's<00:02:44.430> lay<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.269> go<00:02:49.450> let's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
16 so let's lay in there we go let's

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.810 
16 so let's lay in there we go let's
press<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.050> button

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.390 

and<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.500> one<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:58.540> time<00:02:59.190> there<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.280> go

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
and there is one more time there we go

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.580 
and there is one more time there we go
the<00:03:00.640> Dyson<00:03:01.120> finished<00:03:01.420> rolling<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:02.230> now<00:03:02.470> I'm

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
the Dyson finished rolling so now I'm

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.990 
the Dyson finished rolling so now I'm
going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.830> solve<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.160> puzzle<00:03:03.520> for<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.760> last

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
going to solve the puzzle for the last

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:17.580 
going to solve the puzzle for the last
time<00:03:04.330> I<00:03:04.800> do<00:03:05.800> believe<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.430> number<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.850> 8<00:03:16.590> there

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
time I do believe the number is 8 there

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.560 
time I do believe the number is 8 there
we<00:03:17.680> go<00:03:17.860> I'm<00:03:18.160> now<00:03:18.460> a<00:03:18.490> member<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.090> secret

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
we go I'm now a member of the secret

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.870 
we go I'm now a member of the secret

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
over the world well that was very

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.100 
over the world well that was very
interesting<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:36.300> yeah<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.330> can't<00:03:37.630> reveal<00:03:37.840> to

you what all that's about but anyway

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.030 
you what all that's about but anyway
Cooper<00:03:41.230> hampson<00:03:41.500> tell<00:03:41.680> me<00:03:41.770> there<00:03:41.920> was<00:03:42.010> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
Cooper hampson tell me there was a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.670 
Cooper hampson tell me there was a
parkour<00:03:42.520> map<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.480> I've<00:03:44.380> been

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
parkour map in here and I've been

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.170 
parkour map in here and I've been
looking<00:03:44.980> around<00:03:45.070> for<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:45.730> i<00:03:45.790> noticed<00:03:46.120> this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
looking around for it and i noticed this

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.140 
looking around for it and i noticed this
waterfall<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.190> i<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.820> is<00:03:48.880> going<00:03:49.060> to

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
waterfall so i think this is going to

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.900 
waterfall so i think this is going to
take<00:03:49.330> us<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:49.990> park<00:03:50.200> or<00:03:50.380> journey<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.820> we

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
take us on the park or journey here we

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.290 
take us on the park or journey here we
go<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.130> had<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> some<00:03:57.550> sort<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.760> East<00:03:58.060> Egg

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
go so you had a some sort of East Egg

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.860 
go so you had a some sort of East Egg
going<00:03:58.630> on<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:59.050> then<00:03:59.290> all<00:03:59.410> is<00:03:59.440> burn<00:04:00.660> we've<00:04:01.660> got

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
going on here then all is burn we've got

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.400 
going on here then all is burn we've got
to<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.050> careful<00:04:03.390> where<00:04:04.390> does<00:04:04.480> this<00:04:04.630> go<00:04:04.690> hold

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
to be careful where does this go hold

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.760 
to be careful where does this go hold
shift<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:09.630> think<00:04:10.630> this<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.110> way<00:04:11.290> doesn't

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
shift I think this is the way doesn't

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.620 
shift I think this is the way doesn't
look<00:04:12.010> like<00:04:12.160> there's<00:04:12.310> any<00:04:12.430> way<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.820> go<00:04:13.420> that<00:04:13.600> way

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
look like there's any way to go that way

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.330 
look like there's any way to go that way
so<00:04:13.810> we'll<00:04:14.050> go<00:04:14.200> around<00:04:14.260> here

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.340 

what's<00:04:22.340> that<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:23.900> think<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.110> goes

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
what's that and I think that goes

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.600 
what's that and I think that goes
anywhere<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:24.740> think<00:04:24.920> we've<00:04:25.040> got<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.190> jump<00:04:25.430> across

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
anywhere I think we've got a jump across

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.130 
anywhere I think we've got a jump across
to<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.940> bit<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.660> that's<00:04:26.780> going<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.110> a

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
to that bit and that's going to be a

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:36.090 
to that bit and that's going to be a
sprint<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:30.080> was<00:04:30.200> close<00:04:30.440> there<00:04:31.130> we<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:34.480> and

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
sprint that was close there we go and

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:46.510 
sprint that was close there we go and
where<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.280> next<00:04:40.090> thing<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:43.060> top<00:04:44.060> brand<00:04:44.360> ah<00:04:45.520> okay

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
where to next thing on top brand ah okay

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.490 
where to next thing on top brand ah okay
we<00:04:46.640> can<00:04:46.760> go<00:04:46.790> across<00:04:47.000> there<00:04:47.420> with<00:04:47.540> these<00:04:47.690> vines

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.900 

and<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:51.950> looks<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.280> another<00:04:52.400> sprint

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
and now it looks like another sprint

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.750 
and now it looks like another sprint
jump<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.260> failed<00:04:54.620> oh<00:04:57.040> hell<00:04:58.040> I'll<00:04:58.430> get<00:04:58.640> back

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
jump and I failed oh hell I'll get back

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.880 
jump and I failed oh hell I'll get back
to<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:58.970> bit<00:04:59.270> again<00:05:00.730> almost<00:05:01.730> there<00:05:01.940> yep<00:05:02.890> okay

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
to that bit again almost there yep okay

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.660 
to that bit again almost there yep okay
and<00:05:04.070> we're<00:05:04.220> back<00:05:05.560> try<00:05:06.560> that<00:05:06.770> again<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:07.220> failed

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
and we're back try that again a failed

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.080 
and we're back try that again a failed
twice<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.780> them<00:05:09.340> okay<00:05:10.340> first<00:05:10.640> time's<00:05:10.940> the

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
twice for them okay first time's the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.180 
twice for them okay first time's the
charm<00:05:12.520> all<00:05:13.520> there<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.410> as<00:05:15.410> a<00:05:15.440> real<00:05:15.680> pain<00:05:15.950> going

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
charm all there is as a real pain going

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:28.850 
charm all there is as a real pain going
background<00:05:16.700> that<00:05:16.820> bit<00:05:17.620> anyway<00:05:20.470> where<00:05:21.470> to<00:05:21.680> next

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.580 

or<00:05:29.860> maybe<00:05:30.099> we're<00:05:30.370> supposed<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.819> a<00:05:31.319> and<00:05:32.319> then<00:05:32.439> go

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
or maybe we're supposed to a and then go

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.969 
or maybe we're supposed to a and then go
on<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.740> that<00:05:32.949> bit<00:05:33.219> and<00:05:34.650> then<00:05:35.650> I<00:05:37.710> think<00:05:38.710> we<00:05:38.830> might

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
on to that bit and then I think we might

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.550 
on to that bit and then I think we might
have<00:05:39.069> to<00:05:39.159> go<00:05:39.279> around<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.580> side<00:05:39.819> of<00:05:40.029> that<00:05:40.560> it's

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
have to go around the side of that it's

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.809 
have to go around the side of that it's
that<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.919> won't<00:05:42.069> be<00:05:42.159> able<00:05:42.249> to<00:05:42.370> get<00:05:42.490> anywhere

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
that you won't be able to get anywhere

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.269 
that you won't be able to get anywhere
if<00:05:42.909> you<00:05:43.029> climb<00:05:43.270> up<00:05:43.330> those<00:05:43.659> vines<00:05:44.129> let's<00:05:45.129> give

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
if you climb up those vines let's give

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:53.219 
if you climb up those vines let's give
this<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.520> go<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:49.330> was<00:05:49.419> a<00:05:49.449> fail<00:05:51.930> there<00:05:52.930> we<00:05:53.050> go

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
this a go that was a fail there we go

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.659 
this a go that was a fail there we go
and<00:05:54.479> hop<00:05:55.479> along<00:05:55.689> to<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:55.960> bit<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.550> then<00:05:57.550> we

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
and hop along to this bit and then we

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.119 
and hop along to this bit and then we
want<00:05:57.849> to<00:05:57.939> go<00:05:58.090> on<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.449> vines<00:05:58.749> on<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.259> outside<00:05:59.800> I

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
want to go on the vines on the outside I

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.649 
want to go on the vines on the outside I
think<00:06:00.789> we've<00:06:00.909> gotta<00:06:01.060> go<00:06:01.180> around<00:06:01.240> to<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.569> other

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
think we've gotta go around to the other

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:13.019 
think we've gotta go around to the other
side<00:06:04.710> as<00:06:05.710> close<00:06:07.229> like<00:06:08.229> fail<00:06:09.150> idea<00:06:11.699> okay<00:06:12.699> come

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
side as close like fail idea okay come

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:17.939 
side as close like fail idea okay come
on<00:06:13.150> never<00:06:13.810> go<00:06:16.020> okay<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.080> this<00:06:17.349> time<00:06:17.589> we<00:06:17.770> gotta

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
on never go okay so this time we gotta

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.879 
on never go okay so this time we gotta
get<00:06:18.069> on<00:06:18.189> the<00:06:18.310> outside<00:06:18.339> and<00:06:19.589> it's<00:06:20.589> going<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.770> be

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:20.889 
get on the outside and it's going to be

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.379 
get on the outside and it's going to be
tricky<00:06:22.560> there<00:06:23.560> we<00:06:23.650> go<00:06:23.830> let's<00:06:24.129> go<00:06:24.879> through<00:06:25.120> here

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
tricky there we go let's go through here

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.230 
tricky there we go let's go through here
this<00:06:25.569> is<00:06:25.749> clearly<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.289> next<00:06:26.650> bit<00:06:26.860> and<00:06:27.569> then<00:06:28.569> go

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
this is clearly the next bit and then go

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.950 
this is clearly the next bit and then go
I<00:06:32.639> think<00:06:33.639> we<00:06:33.729> go<00:06:33.909> up<00:06:33.969> here<00:06:36.689> that's<00:06:37.689> pretty

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
I think we go up here that's pretty

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.820 
I think we go up here that's pretty
obvious<00:06:38.080> jump<00:06:38.979> across<00:06:39.189> there<00:06:40.589> was<00:06:41.589> going<00:06:41.770> to

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
obvious jump across there was going to

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.670 
obvious jump across there was going to
miss<00:06:41.979> it<00:06:42.009> for<00:06:42.310> a<00:06:42.339> second<00:06:42.789> and

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:55.810 

let's<00:06:47.610> go<00:06:47.789> down<00:06:47.940> here<00:06:48.180> next<00:06:51.949> all<00:06:52.949> right<00:06:53.100> and<00:06:53.340> ah

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
let's go down here next all right and ah

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.090 
let's go down here next all right and ah
there<00:06:56.820> we<00:06:56.940> go<00:06:57.440> that's<00:06:58.440> what<00:06:58.590> I'm<00:06:58.650> looking<00:06:58.710> for

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
there we go that's what I'm looking for

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.340 
there we go that's what I'm looking for
a<00:06:59.130> music<00:06:59.520> disc<00:06:59.699> all<00:07:00.330> those<00:07:00.539> jukebox<00:07:01.110> at<00:07:01.289> the

a music disc all those jukebox at the

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.629 
a music disc all those jukebox at the
beginning<00:07:01.650> wasn't<00:07:01.919> there<00:07:02.070> let's<00:07:02.370> go<00:07:02.520> this

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
beginning wasn't there let's go this

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.960 
beginning wasn't there let's go this
into<00:07:02.910> that<00:07:03.740> one<00:07:04.740> anyway<00:07:04.979> q<00:07:05.280> Pam<00:07:05.460> stuff<00:07:05.759> that

was a wicked puzzle that happening going

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.790 
was a wicked puzzle that happening going
