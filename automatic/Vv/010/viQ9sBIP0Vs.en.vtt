role<00:03:28.110> throughout<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.530> day<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.519> was<00:03:29.670> like

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
role throughout the day so this was like

anymore<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:31.920> i<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.160> wanted<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.370> include<00:03:32.670> her

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
anymore but i just wanted to include her

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.030 
anymore but i just wanted to include her
because<00:03:33.239> this<00:03:33.870> was<00:03:34.080> this<00:03:34.500> used<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.890> one<00:03:35.010> of

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
because this was this used to be one of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.979 
because this was this used to be one of
my<00:03:35.190> fully<00:03:35.459> grown<00:03:35.700> foundations<00:03:36.300> they<00:03:36.780> have

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
my fully grown foundations they have

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.610 
my fully grown foundations they have
actually<00:03:37.200> reformulated<00:03:37.920> this

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
actually reformulated this

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.530 
actually reformulated this
and<00:03:38.709> added<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.129> pump<00:03:39.430> which<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.299> annoying

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
and added a pump which is so annoying

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.600 
and added a pump which is so annoying
because<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.500> course<00:03:41.769> when<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> used<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.340> use<00:03:42.430> it

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
because of course when I used to use it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.759 
because of course when I used to use it
would<00:03:42.879> be<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.239> this<00:03:43.330> dodgy<00:03:43.750> kind<00:03:44.049> of<00:03:44.110> poor

this one is more kind of I would say

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.580 
this one is more kind of I would say
it's<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.510> between<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.900> BB<00:04:20.169> cream<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.530> a

issue<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.389> have<00:04:25.600> with<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.810> one<00:04:26.139> is<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.650> it

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
issue I have with this one is that it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.710 
issue I have with this one is that it
contains<00:04:27.190> alcohol<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.389> slightly

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
contains alcohol so it is slightly

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.029 
contains alcohol so it is slightly
drying<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.320> find<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.710> should<00:04:29.830> have<00:04:29.919> to

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
drying I find that you should have to

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.560 
drying I find that you should have to
wear<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> good<00:04:30.550> moisturizer<00:04:30.789> underneath

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
wear a good moisturizer underneath

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.600 
wear a good moisturizer underneath
otherwise<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.260> will<00:04:32.410> slightly<00:04:33.130> dry<00:04:33.460> out<00:04:33.550> my

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
otherwise it will slightly dry out my

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.760 
otherwise it will slightly dry out my
