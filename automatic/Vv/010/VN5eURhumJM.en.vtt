00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
team this season after that crash plays

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.340 
team this season after that crash plays
are<00:03:05.130> slowly<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.240> creep<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.600> again<00:03:06.930> but

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
are slowly going to creep up again but

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.590 
are slowly going to creep up again but
we<00:03:07.440> didn't<00:03:07.680> expect<00:03:08.190> them<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:08.850> up<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.240> much

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
we didn't expect them to go up this much

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.060 
we didn't expect them to go up this much
now<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.870> reason<00:03:10.110> why<00:03:10.470> they've<00:03:10.710> gone<00:03:10.740> up<00:03:10.950> this

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
now the reason why they've gone up this

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.650 
now the reason why they've gone up this
much<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.490> because<00:03:11.640> coin<00:03:12.030> prices<00:03:12.210> at<00:03:12.570> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
much is because coin prices at the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.320 
much is because coin prices at the
moment<00:03:13.020> are<00:03:13.140> at<00:03:13.560> an<00:03:13.680> all-time<00:03:13.920> low<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:15.060> some

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
moment are at an all-time low for some

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.510 
moment are at an all-time low for some
frickin<00:03:15.750> reason<00:03:15.870> they're<00:03:16.590> really<00:03:17.160> really<00:03:17.400> low

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
frickin reason they're really really low

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.190 
frickin reason they're really really low
at<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> moment<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.600> buy<00:03:18.959> coins

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
at the moment so you can buy coins

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.230 
at the moment so you can buy coins
pretty<00:03:19.590> cheap<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.130> has<00:03:20.250> caused<00:03:20.520> players

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
pretty cheap and that has caused players

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.260 
pretty cheap and that has caused players
to<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.840> rock<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.260> up<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.740> price<00:03:22.980> now<00:03:23.280> what<00:03:24.090> do
