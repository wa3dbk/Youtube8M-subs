hey this is ed with atticfoil.com and

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.380 
hey this is ed with atticfoil.com and
this<00:00:03.540> video<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:04.020> called<00:00:04.230> what's<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.069> payback

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
this video is called what's the payback

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.450 
this video is called what's the payback
people<00:00:06.390> always<00:00:06.509> want<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> know<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.859> energy

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
people always want to know do energy

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.520 
people always want to know do energy
improvements<00:00:09.059> really<00:00:09.480> pay<00:00:09.690> off<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
improvements really pay off and the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.160 
improvements really pay off and the
answer<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.860> yes<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.849> math<00:00:12.150> proves<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.929> in<00:00:13.049> this

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
answer is yes the math proves it in this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
thing is to focus on dollars not a

thing is to focus on dollars not a
percentage<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> savings<00:02:22.770> people<00:02:23.340> has

decrease my electric bill and really the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.260 
decrease my electric bill and really the
question<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.140> how<00:02:28.440> many<00:02:28.500> dollars<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.030> take

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
question is how many dollars will I take

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.530

off<00:02:30.510> my<00:02:30.750> electric<00:02:31.470> bill<00:02:32.180> when<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.270> comes<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
off my electric bill when it comes to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.750 
off my electric bill when it comes to
estimating<00:02:34.110> savings<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.710> payback<00:02:34.860> it's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
estimating savings and payback it's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.870 
estimating savings and payback it's
really<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> question<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.570> based<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:37.020> spending<00:02:37.560> X

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880
