the visibility is not too good you can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.530 
the visibility is not too good you can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
get really horribly lost on this reef

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.020 
get really horribly lost on this reef
it's<00:01:41.540> quite<00:01:41.780> important<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.590> go<00:01:43.490> with<00:01:43.520> someone

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
it's quite important to go with someone

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.000 
it's quite important to go with someone
that<00:01:44.180> really<00:01:44.390> knows<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.990> particular<00:01:45.470> part

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
that really knows this particular part

00:01:46.010 --> 00:02:04.480 
that really knows this particular part
of<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> area<00:02:02.050> once<00:02:03.050> we<00:02:03.320> were<00:02:03.560> right<00:02:04.070> up<00:02:04.220> on<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
of the area once we were right up on the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.400 
of the area once we were right up on the
southern<00:02:04.880> rock<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.390> was<00:02:05.660> definitely

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
southern rock it was definitely

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.760 
southern rock it was definitely
worthwhile<00:02:07.600> just<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.750> amount<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.260> fish<00:02:09.530> up

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
worthwhile just the amount of fish up

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.760 
worthwhile just the amount of fish up
here<00:02:09.979> was<00:02:10.450> hugely<00:02:11.450> different<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.350> where<00:02:12.650> we

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
here was hugely different to where we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.880 
here was hugely different to where we
dropped<00:02:13.040> down<00:02:16.780> at<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.959> most<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.380> these<00:02:18.500> rocky

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
dropped down at the most of these rocky

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.740 
dropped down at the most of these rocky
outcrops<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.550> found<00:02:19.880> these<00:02:20.060> through<00:02:20.390> caves

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
outcrops you found these through caves

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.280 
outcrops you found these through caves
and<00:02:21.940> quite<00:02:22.940> often<00:02:23.180> you'll<00:02:23.540> find<00:02:23.840> these<00:02:24.020> big

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and quite often you'll find these big

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.320 
and quite often you'll find these big
schools<00:02:24.739> or<00:02:25.070> these<00:02:25.220> drop<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.700> old<00:02:25.850> catfish

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
schools or these drop the old catfish

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.750 
schools or these drop the old catfish
and<00:02:26.570> they're<00:02:27.470> almost<00:02:27.620> like<00:02:27.920> little<00:02:28.070> dredging

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and they're almost like little dredging

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.610 
and they're almost like little dredging
machines<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.450> try<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:29.720> keep<00:02:29.989> these<00:02:30.260> little

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
machines I try and keep these little

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.100 
machines I try and keep these little
caves<00:02:30.920> nice<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.520> clean<00:02:31.850> keeping<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
caves nice and clean keeping the the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.479 
caves nice and clean keeping the the
sand<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.709> the<00:02:33.950> caves

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
sand out of the caves

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:46.750 
sand out of the caves
keeping<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.180> open<00:02:43.959> as<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.950> started<00:02:46.550> drifting

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
keeping it open as I started drifting

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.270 
keeping it open as I started drifting
down<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.420> reef<00:02:47.570> again<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.320> particular<00:02:48.590> Rock

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
down the reef again this particular Rock

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
down the reef again this particular Rock
was<00:02:49.630> teeming<00:02:50.630> with<00:02:50.750> these<00:02:51.110> little<00:02:51.530> glasses

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
was teeming with these little glasses

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.320 
was teeming with these little glasses
they're<00:02:54.470> two<00:02:54.769> really<00:02:55.280> nice<00:02:55.459> big<00:02:55.880> tomorrow

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
they're two really nice big tomorrow

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.650 
they're two really nice big tomorrow
rockin<00:02:56.750> day

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.479 

strangely<00:03:01.660> enough<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.260> even<00:03:02.410> see<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.280> big

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
strangely enough we even see the the big

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.059 
strangely enough we even see the the big
potato<00:03:03.700> best<00:03:04.300> today<00:03:04.690> they<00:03:05.319> do<00:03:05.380> come<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:05.980> go

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
potato best today they do come and go

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.479 
potato best today they do come and go
and<00:03:06.400> these<00:03:07.390> are<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.750> next<00:03:08.080> biggest<00:03:08.489> rock

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
and these are the next biggest rock
