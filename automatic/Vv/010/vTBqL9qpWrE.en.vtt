00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello how about in the previous capsule 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.490
 we decided some reasons to pray and 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.930
 we promised to do a second 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.299
 capsule on how to know 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.620
 but we realized that it is impossible 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.710
 teach now in a video of 3000 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.970
 but as I learn by praying we think of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 share some suggestions 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 super basic practices to grow in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 the life of prayer we want to offer you 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.040
 three elementary forms 1 the dialogue 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.740
 constant and natural with god if you can 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.530
 Of course, if you share your life with God 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.000
 he is going to share his he is to say 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.000
 all your thanks 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.700
 this was an excellent deal and it's mega 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.770
 it will be enough for you to remember that God 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.770
 is always with you for example 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.989
 when you wake up, say hello when 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.600
 leave home say goodbye to you 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 accompany that protects and when you go to 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 lay down 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.320
 the calculators and those you enter and with 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.030
 the whole tradition of the church of 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.260
 Christian PRSC memory and repeats 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 accompanying with the heart what it says 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.860
 my words 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.660
 then learn from three or four and from 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.270
 the dozens of times during the day 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.369
 especially when you need it 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 important is that it is not a routine but 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 an act of the heart for example 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.450
 Jesus meek and humble of heart is my 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 heart similar to yours 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.140
 holy spirit source of light illuminates me 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.780
 Sacred Heart of Jesus in you I trust 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 and so we move on to the third way of praying 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.250
 the gospel meditation the gospel 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.440
 is the most essential book in the life of the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 Christian because it's the same word of 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.020
 God who tells us what Jesus Christ 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.870
 He said did glass suffer and taught about 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.880
 the earth not knowing the gospel is not 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 know jesus christ and not know him 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.280
 In addition to sharing all your day with God 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.280
 OK 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.640
 some minutes just to see 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.890
 how many 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.200
 five minutes minimum and from there in 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.090
 forward all the mortal forgiveness life by 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.170
 example with four seconds more lags 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.170
 three hours a day 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.690
 in those minutes that you have to take 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.690
 gospel 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.190
 A) Yes 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.720
 or so here you will find the four 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.720
 white king evangelists 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 I recommend you start reading 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.000
 from the beginning and for example if you have 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.760
 Ten minutes read it calmly during 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.340
 five and we five ask god 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.050
 what did he mean by this passage and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.880
 ended by offering goodbye 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.370
 personal response to what he has 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.270
 said for example be more generous with 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.430
 your friends 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.850
 convenient with your parents responsible in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.390
 your studies better management promote 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.390
 these videos 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.189
 but yes, of course, goodbye
