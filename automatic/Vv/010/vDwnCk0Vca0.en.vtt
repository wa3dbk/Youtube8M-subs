00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.100
 the trick 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:20.200
 G 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:22.060
 This edition was produced by and 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.920
 show you how to do it best in 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.170
 can integrate his letter film 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.450
 or better said, what options 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.640
 There is always something in there 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.619
 move unless it is located 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 on a flat and closed 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.300
 surface and it is completely windless 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.100
 so that the two main factors of the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.510
 actually already called water movement 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.039
 are and falls wind water gets through 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.519
 wind mainly on the sea though 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.800
 also set in motion on big lakes 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.840
 the wind lets you over the water and eat 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.179
 standing waves if it can be good 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 with lego stone animate the movement 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:01.570
 of water to clarify the practice 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.410
 basically you need a lot first 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.410
 blue stones 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.610
 and best of all a blue base plate 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.800
 so that you have a base so the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.030
 on the sea ​​surface then the 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
 to move waves 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.390
 You can choose with different ones 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.490
 Stones generate probably the simplest 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.950
 variant is simply normal angular 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.870
 base stones with a width of 2 still 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 to take 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.250
 However, this variant is the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.430
 Unschönste because we are not square 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.080
 note sets the stone when animating 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.130
 always in front of a row 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.600
 This creates a more fluid movement 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.150
 but can beautify the whole 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 by putting thin stone slabs behind the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 stars 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.260
 Of course, there are many others 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.210
 possibilities that are a lot better 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.830
 look like his wave shape 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.930
 you can, for example, thin plates 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.110
 place it diagonally on the plate 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.820
 use oblique stones or simple 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.470
 only thin plates take if the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.470
 should be low 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.690
 but now the waves are still visible 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.970
 a bit boring and unrealistic 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.310
 but that's easy 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.780
 Change by adding white stones to the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 incorporating top of the waves 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.240
 It's called the gout so the foam 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.240
 waves of the building can be seen 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.390
 I'll show you how to do that 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.810
 process whole to a nice wave 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.940
 can 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.830
 These are just suggestions with it 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.819
 you get an idea what you can do with it 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.830
 can do everything 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.170
 here you see for example a small 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.590
 wave just out of the eighth stone 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.590
 built 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.680
 Here I show you a wave 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.160
 sloping stone or dachstein has only in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 blue 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.140
 I am only building a small one here 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.780
 wave so you can see the design better 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.030
 Of course you can do that in one too 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.020
 big pretend like I am here in 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.020
 Example show 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.670
 with an almost identical 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.130
 You can do animation all the time 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.770
 also choose the ones to beat on zoover 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.270
 apply 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.550
 you need the ones shown here 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.490
 stones which are also shown in the picture 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.820
 Recognize sequence in the animation 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.340
 should he ever been to the sea 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.190
 will probably still to the v-shaped 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.020
 or circular shape of the waves remember 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.090
 when they meet the beach 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.290
 that's what you call the waves 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.340
 overturn 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.810
 that should be synonymous in his animation 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.390
 take the waves into account 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 to the left and take also from the left 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.590
 again 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.420
 I'll tell you an animation 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.420
 this wise emerged 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.210
 the tip 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.310
 especially when using flat 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.740
 stein recommends the lego element 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.460
 Segway tour with the Lego leg 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.530
 easier to remove from the plate 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600
 this is useful because when you see the wave 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.760
 it must be difficult to move 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.760
 to remove thin firmly pressed stones 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.230
 yes, that was it me again 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.730
 Hope you liked it was a lot 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.730
 Helpful is strictly the wears
