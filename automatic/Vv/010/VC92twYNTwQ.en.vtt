00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 I decided to make a pack with 25 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.260
 Christmas to the 25 coolest Christmas fountains 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.019
 Can you find the internet? 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.329
 put it all in a small packet of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.440
 sources and distribute free of charge 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.739
 you guys 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 I really wanted to make one between 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.360
 Christmas thinking of making one of the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.270
 Christmas to give to you or a 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.270
 christmas background for you to see on 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 Only you channel is the time not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.699
 allowed in my creativity also 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.949
 He did not allow the crowd so it's because of the lack 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.000
 of time mainly I can not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.460
 I can not even do the background but I 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.530
 I solved it anyway, give something to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 You guys, I did not want to leave that date so 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.010
 special pass and so I'm here 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.450
 To give 25 free Christmas fountains to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.180
 you ok 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 looks the fonts are all in the format 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.150
 zip 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.890
 you can open it by wandering normally 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 or any other compressor that you 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 I have left it in this format because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 some sources 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 comes with credits to the author of the source 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.259
 and since he did not want to take those credits 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.329
 So I left it there, just look, for example. 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.890
 this source that we have to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.170
 author's credits 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.390
 I wanted to leave it because you're cool. 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.720
 then the author is credited for things 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 what he does is and I hope you do 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.000
 good use of it here you use the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.759
 You do not have to believe in your projects. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.710
 If the source author is asking, there is 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.590
 It would be nice if you believed that 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 No, I 'm not alone. 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.130

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.590
