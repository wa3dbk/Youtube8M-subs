00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello dear friends necessarily 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 here so the error closed your nearly 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.059
 broke the app today 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 personnel officers supposedly should read my mind 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 of course you are in this world now shitty 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.100
 piece of iron husband to read my thoughts as simple 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.769
 explain to me the application is called 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.789
 Magick got her to comment you not 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:31.250
 I was bombed about what I told you about 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.250
 what's normal magic box 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.980
 Ahmadov so far so we both sponges and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:47.579
 here are these magic guys today i'm playing 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.820
 game gopher magic is gopher okay okay 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.530
 let's turn on the sound 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.070
 I wandered so terribly 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 scary sound is quieter 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.650
 essentially we need to make a number 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:07.549
 for example make a number yes shut up 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.490
 interfere with the minutes guessing the number of guys 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 22 and now you need two plus two 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.650
 equals four combine shorter two digits 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.659
 now subtract from the given number 22 22 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.009
 minus 4 okay joke 18 don't think that i am 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.630
 I thought all this time so that later 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.840
 translate it to a joke I really knew 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 that it will be 19 so 18 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.020
 ok now look at the hell 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 this is a picture of a hieroglyph or what is it 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 18 then we have it in general some kind of ravlik 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 and I'm flying, I honestly don’t know okay 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 ravlik let it be ravlik 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:00.910
 moment of moment 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.160
 perfect smart guys this is not a setup 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.680
 no mounting photoshop anything 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.750
 how so the reality of that shit I just 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 falling from bonds like this is really pitiful 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.709
 similarity on an akinator let's make a guess 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:19.360
 number for example my number 245 is not that 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:23.140
 will come out and that there is a prosperity of 1111 to 1 plus 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.150
 1 will be 2 or 3 frets on 2 intuition 11 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.590
 minus 29 so so 99 this or expose 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 the mouse will remove from here about that because I 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.250
 I just drive there and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.690
 and this let's type i'm looking at another 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.390
 video of the new continent 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.550
 so this is some kind of rosette from 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.959
 a bottle of broken some horseradish boot 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:49.180
 like that in general, remember it as 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.510
 Shoes well, that all all that I can not 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.030
 more 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.920
 ok last time if if you again 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.880
 guess what number is 255 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.459
 poke and 55 so 5.10 55 minutes ten 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.650
 shut up 55 - 10:45 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.810
 further okay okay 40 5:45 it’s for us 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.730
 garbage shichko such a clock also did not fit 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.730
 they simply led us to 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:36.180

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.500
