the dogs you know I work them up on a
table<00:00:17.830> and<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.220> reason<00:00:18.310> I<00:00:18.550> do<00:00:18.610> it<00:00:19.030> I<00:00:19.330> mean

are<00:00:30.519> using<00:00:30.939> these<00:00:31.000> little<00:00:31.210> elevated<00:00:31.810> surfaces

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
are using these little elevated surfaces

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.510 
are using these little elevated surfaces
for<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:32.680> many<00:00:32.890> things<00:00:33.220> that<00:00:33.340> sometimes

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
for so many things that sometimes

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.160 
for so many things that sometimes
they're<00:00:33.790> only<00:00:33.970> elevated<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:34.660> far<00:00:34.870> off<00:00:35.140> the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
they're only elevated that far off the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.380 
they're only elevated that far off the
ground<00:00:35.920> little<00:00:36.460> tables<00:00:37.000> little<00:00:37.180> training

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
ground little tables little training

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.569 
ground little tables little training
boxes<00:00:37.960> whatever<00:00:38.410> guys<00:00:38.770> are<00:00:39.010> calling<00:00:39.250> their

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
boxes whatever guys are calling their

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.250 
boxes whatever guys are calling their
targets<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.180> what<00:00:40.300> they<00:00:40.450> are<00:00:40.629> you<00:00:41.140> know

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
targets of what they are you know

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.990 
targets of what they are you know
basically<00:00:41.649> you're<00:00:42.100> taking<00:00:42.250> you're<00:00:42.699> picking

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
basically you're taking you're picking

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.729 
basically you're taking you're picking
this<00:00:43.090> little<00:00:43.300> table<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.809> you're<00:00:44.379> putting<00:00:44.590> it

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
this little table and you're putting it

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.770 
this little table and you're putting it
out<00:00:44.829> in<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.039> grass<00:00:45.219> rattling<00:00:45.879> out<00:00:46.510> on<00:00:46.629> your

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
out in the grass rattling out on your

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.290 
out in the grass rattling out on your
training<00:00:46.989> field<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.590> it<00:00:48.010> creates<00:00:48.520> a<00:00:48.789> nice

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
training field and it creates a nice

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.750 
training field and it creates a nice
target<00:00:50.140> for<00:00:50.350> your<00:00:50.440> dog<00:00:50.680> that<00:00:51.160> targets<00:00:51.550> got<00:00:51.670> an

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
target for your dog that targets got an

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.189 
target for your dog that targets got an
elevation<00:00:52.359> difference<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.780> mean<00:00:52.899> it's<00:00:52.989> higher

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
elevation difference I mean it's higher

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.200 
elevation difference I mean it's higher
than<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.620> ground<00:00:53.800> okay<00:00:54.460> there's<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.760> textural

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
than the ground okay there's a textural

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.910 
than the ground okay there's a textural
difference<00:00:55.660> right<00:00:56.050> you're<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.500> know<00:00:56.620> there's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
difference right you're you know there's

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.560 
difference right you're you know there's
a<00:00:56.980> big<00:00:57.219> difference<00:00:57.370> between<00:00:57.640> wood<00:00:58.180> or<00:00:58.449> or

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
a big difference between wood or or

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.290 
a big difference between wood or or
canvas<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.769> concrete<00:01:00.340> or<00:01:00.519> grass<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:01.059> mean<00:01:01.210> so

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
canvas and concrete or grass I mean so

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.819 
canvas and concrete or grass I mean so
it's<00:01:01.420> easy<00:01:01.660> once<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.019> dog<00:01:02.199> gets<00:01:02.410> up<00:01:02.500> there<00:01:02.679> on

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
it's easy once that dog gets up there on

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.259 
it's easy once that dog gets up there on
it<00:01:02.980> knows<00:01:03.219> that<00:01:03.399> good<00:01:03.519> things<00:01:03.730> happen<00:01:04.090> on<00:01:04.150> that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
it knows that good things happen on that

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.690 
it knows that good things happen on that
little<00:01:04.449> table<00:01:04.930> then<00:01:05.590> he's<00:01:05.740> actively<00:01:06.160> looking

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
little table then he's actively looking

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.940 
little table then he's actively looking
for<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.000> little<00:01:07.150> table<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:08.380> it's<00:01:08.530> great<00:01:08.799> it

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
for that little table so it's great it

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.530 
for that little table so it's great it
helps<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.310> concentrate<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.180> other<00:01:10.330> thing

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
helps them concentrate the other thing

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.660 
helps them concentrate the other thing
is<00:01:10.659> once<00:01:10.840> you<00:01:10.990> get<00:01:11.290> them<00:01:11.439> on<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> table<00:01:12.130> now

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
is once you get them on the table now

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.510 
is once you get them on the table now
instead<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.570> becoming<00:01:14.500> distracted<00:01:15.040> and

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
instead of becoming distracted and

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.390 
instead of becoming distracted and
moving<00:01:15.790> out<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> place<00:01:16.180> being<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.540> one<00:01:16.810> step

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
moving out of place being a one step

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.740 
moving out of place being a one step
process<00:01:18.400> where<00:01:18.640> like<00:01:19.030> say<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.299> dog<00:01:19.509> is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
process where like say the dog is

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.260 
process where like say the dog is
sitting<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:21.460> know<00:01:21.549> your<00:01:21.729> training<00:01:22.060> field

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
sitting on you know your training field

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.300 
sitting on you know your training field
and<00:01:22.780> gets<00:01:23.049> distracted<00:01:23.320> well<00:01:23.829> he<00:01:23.950> might<00:01:24.130> just

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
and gets distracted well he might just

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.460 
and gets distracted well he might just
move<00:01:24.490> off<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.780> know<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.110> then<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.290> got<00:01:26.409> a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
move off you know and then you got a

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.200 
move off you know and then you got a
fuss<00:01:26.770> at<00:01:27.040> him<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.369> he<00:01:27.460> doesn't<00:01:27.640> know<00:01:27.820> exactly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
fuss at him and he doesn't know exactly

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.700 
fuss at him and he doesn't know exactly
where<00:01:28.420> he<00:01:28.479> should<00:01:28.689> be<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.930> what-have-you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
where he should be and what-have-you

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.889 
where he should be and what-have-you
it's<00:01:30.009> crazy<00:01:30.369> but<00:01:31.000> if<00:01:31.210> he's<00:01:31.329> on<00:01:31.450> elevated

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it's crazy but if he's on elevated

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:32.969 
it's crazy but if he's on elevated
surface<00:01:32.170> now<00:01:32.290> he<00:01:32.350> has<00:01:32.439> to<00:01:32.530> make<00:01:32.649> two<00:01:32.829> decisions

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
surface now he has to make two decisions

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.370 
surface now he has to make two decisions
it's<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.670> off<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.149> elevated<00:01:34.570> surface<00:01:34.930> then

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
it's the off the elevated surface then

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.170
