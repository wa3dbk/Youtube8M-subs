do some work on my in move robot arm
here

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
here

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.089 
here
I<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> tidy<00:00:09.780> some<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.349> out<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.950> is

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I got a tidy some of this out this is

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.490 
I got a tidy some of this out this is
kind<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.550> rack<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.210> I'll<00:00:13.139> show<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.320> what

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
kind of a rack and I'll show you what

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.760 
kind of a rack and I'll show you what
I'm<00:00:13.590> gonna<00:00:13.679> do

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.609 

plan<00:00:23.770> here<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.369> move<00:00:24.850> from<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.750> uno<00:00:26.350> that

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
plan here is to move from the uno that

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.590 
plan here is to move from the uno that
I've<00:00:26.740> had<00:00:26.920> this<00:00:27.130> on<00:00:27.340> forever<00:00:27.850> with<00:00:28.119> this<00:00:28.300> rat's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
I've had this on forever with this rat's

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.870 
I've had this on forever with this rat's
nest<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:29.140> lousy<00:00:29.350> wires<00:00:29.830> this<00:00:30.250> is<00:00:30.340> one<00:00:30.520> reason<00:00:30.700> I

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
nest a lousy wires this is one reason I

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.090 
nest a lousy wires this is one reason I
really<00:00:31.000> don't<00:00:31.270> like<00:00:31.420> the<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:31.750> know<00:00:31.930> with<00:00:32.349> the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
really don't like the you know with the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.640 
really don't like the you know with the
female<00:00:33.670> headers<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:35.020> think<00:00:35.230> we'll<00:00:35.379> move<00:00:35.500> it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
female headers and I think we'll move it

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.060 
female headers and I think we'll move it
over<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.160> an<00:00:36.489> arduino<00:00:36.910> nano<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.710> maybe<00:00:38.710> set<00:00:38.980> it

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
over to an arduino nano and maybe set it

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.310 
over to an arduino nano and maybe set it
up<00:00:39.220> on<00:00:39.400> some<00:00:39.730> perf<00:00:39.940> board<00:00:40.330> with<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.660> socket<00:00:41.019> and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
up on some perf board with a socket and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.590 
up on some perf board with a socket and
then<00:00:41.680> instead<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.430> my<00:00:42.550> battery<00:00:42.760> feed<00:00:43.239> a<00:00:43.269> little

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
then instead of my battery feed a little

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360 
then instead of my battery feed a little
bit<00:00:43.750> better<00:00:43.900> than<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.379> mess<00:00:44.739> and<00:00:45.040> then<00:00:45.129> maybe

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
bit better than this mess and then maybe

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.460 
bit better than this mess and then maybe
I<00:00:45.519> can<00:00:45.670> actually<00:00:46.000> show<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.690> thing<00:00:46.930> off<00:00:47.230> to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
I can actually show this thing off to

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.439 
I can actually show this thing off to
people<00:00:47.949> who<00:00:48.040> want<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.400> see<00:00:48.580> it<00:00:48.730> right<00:00:48.970> now<00:00:49.030> this

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
people who want to see it right now this

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.090 
people who want to see it right now this
thing<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.720> not<00:00:49.960> portable<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.710> hasn't<00:00:50.920> been

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
thing is not portable and hasn't been

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.759 
thing is not portable and hasn't been
ever<00:00:51.640> it's<00:00:52.059> just<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.360> mess<00:00:52.600> anyway<00:00:53.080> just<00:00:53.530> quick

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
ever it's just a mess anyway just quick

ever it's just a mess anyway just quick
video<00:00:54.040> guys

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.040 

through<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.550> magic<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.970> video<00:01:06.090> editing<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
through the magic of video editing we

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.340 
through the magic of video editing we
are<00:01:07.290> done<00:01:07.910> this<00:01:08.910> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.120> arm<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.660> sits<00:01:09.960> now

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
are done this is the arm as it sits now

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.680 
are done this is the arm as it sits now
I<00:01:10.890> didn't<00:01:11.610> make<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> guys<00:01:12.000> sit<00:01:12.300> through<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
I didn't make you guys sit through this

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.810 
I didn't make you guys sit through this
because<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.160> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because there's not much to see here I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
because there's not much to see here I
just<00:01:14.880> took<00:01:15.510> the<00:01:15.750> perf<00:01:15.990> board<00:01:16.410> and<00:01:16.800> made<00:01:17.040> some

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
just took the perf board and made some

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
just took the perf board and made some
really<00:01:17.550> ugly<00:01:17.670> connections<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> took<00:01:19.440> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
really ugly connections on it and took a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.520 
really ugly connections on it and took a
Shaka<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.490> set<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> Arduino<00:01:21.479> Nano<00:01:21.510> into<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
Shaka and set the Arduino Nano into it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.330 
Shaka and set the Arduino Nano into it
and<00:01:22.800> ran<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> bus<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.150> my<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.510> cell<00:01:25.050> lipo<00:01:25.340> all

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and ran a bus for my two cell lipo all

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.000 
and ran a bus for my two cell lipo all
the<00:01:26.580> servos<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.240> hooked<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.020> did<00:01:28.800> notice

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
the servos are hooked up I did notice

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.530 
the servos are hooked up I did notice
I'm<00:01:29.250> having<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.640> trouble<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:29.970> one<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> them

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
I'm having some trouble with one of them

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.749 
I'm having some trouble with one of them
but<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> end<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.970> get

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
but at the end of it this is what we get

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
but at the end of it this is what we get
and<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.910> get<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.180> pinky<00:01:36.660> servo<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.500> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and we get that pinky servo that's just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.300 
and we get that pinky servo that's just
about<00:01:38.250> toast<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.570> hey<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> that's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
about toast but hey so be it that's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
about toast but hey so be it that's
what's<00:01:42.000> gonna<00:01:42.210> happen<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:43.350> I'm<00:01:43.440> using<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what's gonna happen but I'm using the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
what's gonna happen but I'm using the
slow<00:01:44.130> move<00:01:44.399> library<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.330> little<00:01:45.810> slower

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
slow move library to do little slower

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
slow move library to do little slower
move<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.800> fingers<00:01:47.190> I'm<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.700> full

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
move of the fingers I'm not doing full

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940 
move of the fingers I'm not doing full
extension<00:01:48.300> in<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> moves<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.619> that's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
extension in all the moves but that's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
extension in all the moves but that's
the<00:01:50.070> basics<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.450> works<00:01:51.660> pretty<00:01:51.840> good

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the basics of it it works pretty good

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.180 
the basics of it it works pretty good
does<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> job<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.810> yeah<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.740> happy<00:01:56.100> with

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
does the job and yeah pretty happy with

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.219 
does the job and yeah pretty happy with
this<00:01:56.460> needs<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:57.869> but

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
this needs a little bit more work but

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.290 
this needs a little bit more work but
it's<00:01:58.470> not<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> tonight<00:01:59.310> this<00:02:00.240> is

it's not gonna get it tonight this is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.760 
it's not gonna get it tonight this is
where<00:02:00.600> we're<00:02:00.750> gonna<00:02:00.810> leave<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.470> tonight

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
where we're gonna leave it for tonight
