00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone cagnacci in the new video is 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.770
 today I would like to talk about a category 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 of videos on youtube that I think later 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.410
 the gameplay is taking a lot more 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 foot in proportion is that I think it is 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.160
 treated of the same superficiality with 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 which many trait remain themselves 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 superficiality with which many treats 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.840
 film and the exact same superficiality 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 with which many talk about video games and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.289
 I'm talking about the category of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 book reviews category that goes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.960
 more and more and I'm busy because 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.260
 my sister is looking for books to read e 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.910
 that makes when it hears name does on youtube 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.210
 hear people talking about it and yes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
 trusts very much in these people's opinions 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.390
 I say something that I think the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.800
 most reviews 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 I think there are three categories of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 reviews those that open their own 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 children make this book is tall of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.100
 centimeters and width 5 opened the value 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.660
 of pages the paper or but you see in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.399
 backlight here tell me analysis 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 techniques you can simply go 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.210
 bookstore see I don't think that's it 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.380
 that makes me buy like a book 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.360
 edition is good information yes but 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.189
 if that book came out your bric in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 library is too controlled by itself 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.110
 as and therefore as they do not know how to speak 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 they talk to you about what is more 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.659
 easy to talk 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 then there is another gift from the reviewers 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.290
 take another book charles darwin 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 the origin of the species 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.550
 the fathers book 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.080
 from his own struggle in the end vi 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 I tell you the whole book is not there 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.480
 said a single personal opinion to the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.760
 maximum put us some 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.980
 technical feature type but who me 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.150
 pages of adore assistance 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.470
 there is a tarta fetishism around 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.540
 these are the two categories of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.790
 defenders that you must merely send 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.510
 fuck off because they don't say anything who 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.670
 does not know how to talk about things tells the 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.280
 things easier then precisely the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.350
 technical features I propose 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.430
 it is one thing to speak for a moment in calm 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.840
 to make people understand what we're talking about 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.369
 a body and that makes me a video where I am 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.680
 some under the book books not really 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.510
 for tormenting is revealed throughout jerk 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.750
 because you don't know how to do anything 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:13.820
 and then there is a third category of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.590
 book reviewer that I consider it 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.390
 annoying because it was annoying even though it was 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.420
 very competent competent who wants to 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.120
 say are those book reviewers who have 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.720
 a personal culture an intelligence 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.480
 that allow you to extrapolate from a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 book a content a personal opinion 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.150
 to give you an address to do even one 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.610
 reading of what i am reading a lot 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 especially everyone sees us inside maybe 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.700
 book with commitment c see us cesar will have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.500
 a content 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.390
 There are even those who read the book will 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.970
 try to explain the life of an author 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.880
 very very very interesting 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.160
 now not everyone is like that but there are but 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.549
 what are they doing here to do a race 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.980
 clarified more what it does then me 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.780
 I mean how many books now here at al 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.010
 day how many books I read a year 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.590
 in a month I read this and that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.239
 or there is a library bought a hundred lippi 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.790
 still not with these brother to do 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.849
 to see 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.540
 as if it were a competition for those who own 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.709
 more books or even more in my opinion 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.859
 it is read 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.269
 first of all to know ok staff 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.489
 here they are like serving the first 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.680
 other things is above all to be able to 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.370
 share no maybe with others 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.720
 your passionate opinions I have many 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.920
 I read comics that I don't 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.140
 like them because then I know there is a 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 big like him back there discussing about 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.180
 that comic I am a little promoted on which 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.700
 this however I don't mind because me 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.500
 enjoy now you read for yourself and yes 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.599
 it also reads because it enriches us 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.540
 culturally therefore species would be good 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.189
 with others but would also do more books 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.810
 and in fact I find it something they do 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.689
 the videogamer do other comics 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.569
 etc. because there are people who do 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.730
 reading little but I swear I know 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.500
 people who maybe read 56 books 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.129
 the friend but when you talk to them then 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.959
 for example that they are ducts coming out 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.859
 from the university of letters 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.299
 I don't know what more there is one thing 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.709
 it's not a bit in all fields when 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.799
 someone says he said this is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.359
 having seen this test always cd host 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.250
 as to make you believe that maybe a 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.479
 read and understood but does not want to talk about it 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.510
 but maybe he just doesn't have it 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.510
 bed 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.170
 does not seem to me here I find it annoying 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.370
 that when someone says superlibri says 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.290
 electoral law 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.350
 I often say I know how much honest I have it 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.840
 novels I do n't read them I like a little 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.900
 you essay those things they talk about 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.450
 a bit of specific or having arguments 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.310
 a political connotation or a 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.480
 no historical connotation when I am 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.540
 presumption art of war 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.250
 I was curious to know a little about me 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.740
 I am taken by unipro of the table col 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.480
 we were a bit of oriental philosophy 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.610
 then okay surprised four rooms kafka la 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.320
 half moved this and all to 99 cents 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 and then I know I got late Charles 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.890
 the origin of the species ie here 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.890
 I prefer to read announce it with arms 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.150
 the origin of the species which is a 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.070
 kite hunter I read 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.660
 I was just bomber that I have 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.550
 said what it would be interested by 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.970
 But Vito everything there is a 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.860
 in short, a direct connotation with the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.050
 I like it and read it willingly 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.210
 all that is a little novels is a 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.620
 little story I tend to avoid it because I don't 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.050
 is that I am a great reader 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.740
 now I produce this 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.270
 better to say one thing 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.110
 enough with these races to the reader more 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.900
 comics to the reader more 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.730
 film is also egypt because who reads 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.220
 more but you understand them in the end 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.330
 in a conversation when discussing 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.270
 especially on youtube 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.850
 I think the thing comes out without it 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.620
 having to stay to make the list of films that 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.650
 we have seen to the list of books that we are 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.700
 bought beware of those notice 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.320
 obviously they read to you 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.930
 technical features of the book and that 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.420
 they tell me but it is especially when 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.100
 I see some of these characters instead 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.230
 to talk about the books he likes 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.730
 neither to speak well of it they make me see the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.540
 their bookstore when I get them bought 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.640
 when the more I read 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.370
 according to me then to be a little half 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:21.410
 hello to all dogs is on youtube ci 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.410
 wants criticism undergoing
