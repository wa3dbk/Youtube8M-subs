00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
twelve colorways so when there is one

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
twelve colorways so when there is one
that<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.750> it

that I like I just really like it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.530 
that I like I just really like it
because<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.710> such<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.729> disparity

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because there's like such a disparity

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
because there's like such a disparity
between<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.409> good<00:01:31.950> ones<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> bad<00:01:32.460> ones

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
between the good ones and the bad ones

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.670 
between the good ones and the bad ones
in<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.210> opinion<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.020> amazing<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
in my opinion like these are amazing and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.899 
in my opinion like these are amazing and
there's<00:01:34.920> some<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.460> been<00:01:35.610> very

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there's some that have just been very

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.719 
there's some that have just been very
lackluster<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.890> heart<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> line

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
lackluster so the heart of the line

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.719
