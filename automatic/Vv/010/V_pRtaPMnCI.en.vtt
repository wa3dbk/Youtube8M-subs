hi<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.400> Ryan<00:00:05.759> George<00:00:05.970> at<00:00:06.150> Ryan<00:00:06.330> George

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
hi this is Ryan George at Ryan George

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.360 
hi this is Ryan George at Ryan George
fitness<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.200> over<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.500> Nova<00:00:07.859> New<00:00:07.980> York<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
fitness I'm over at Nova New York and

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.129 
fitness I'm over at Nova New York and
Ridgewood<00:00:08.910> Queens<00:00:09.059> today<00:00:09.840> we're<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Ridgewood Queens today we're going to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.660 
Ridgewood Queens today we're going to
talk<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.769> difference<00:00:11.160> between<00:00:11.219> weight

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
talk about the difference between weight

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.669 
talk about the difference between weight
lifting<00:00:12.030> hooks<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.570> weight<00:00:12.929> lifting<00:00:13.320> straps

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
lifting hooks and weight lifting straps

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919 
lifting hooks and weight lifting straps
so<00:00:14.610> typically<00:00:15.030> both<00:00:15.179> weight<00:00:15.420> lifting<00:00:15.780> hooks

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so typically both weight lifting hooks

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.529 
so typically both weight lifting hooks
and<00:00:16.199> straps<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:16.710> used<00:00:17.070> for<00:00:17.430> dead<00:00:17.640> lifting<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and straps are used for dead lifting so

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.900 
and straps are used for dead lifting so
a<00:00:18.570> dead<00:00:18.810> lifting<00:00:19.140> you're<00:00:19.260> essentially<00:00:19.650> just

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
a dead lifting you're essentially just

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.420 
a dead lifting you're essentially just
grabbing<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.029> large<00:00:21.539> typically<00:00:22.529> heavy<00:00:22.830> bar<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
grabbing a large typically heavy bar and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.189 
grabbing a large typically heavy bar and
lifting<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.119> off<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.300> ground<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.050> pretty

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
lifting it off the ground so it's pretty

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.290 
lifting it off the ground so it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:25.529> exercise<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.519> problem

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
straightforward exercise a problem

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050 
straightforward exercise a problem
occurs<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.769> while<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> legs<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
occurs is that while the legs and the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.849 
occurs is that while the legs and the
back<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.720> core<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> arms<00:00:31.529> might<00:00:31.740> be

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
back and the core and the arms might be

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.930 
back and the core and the arms might be
strong<00:00:32.099> enough<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.399> handle<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.759> weight

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
strong enough to handle the weight

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.780 
strong enough to handle the weight
sometimes<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.050> wrists<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.040> hands<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
sometimes the wrists and the hands and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.660 
sometimes the wrists and the hands and
the<00:00:35.910> grip<00:00:36.149> strength<00:00:36.510> isn't<00:00:37.079> quite<00:00:37.670> good

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the grip strength isn't quite good

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
the grip strength isn't quite good
enough<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.120> quite<00:00:39.480> strong<00:00:39.840> enough<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
enough or not quite strong enough to

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
enough or not quite strong enough to
handle<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> weight<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> that's<00:00:41.790> where

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
handle the weight and that's where

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.580 
handle the weight and that's where
weight<00:00:42.180> lifting<00:00:42.510> hooks<00:00:42.660> or<00:00:42.899> straps<00:00:43.170> come<00:00:43.410> into

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
weight lifting hooks or straps come into

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
weight lifting hooks or straps come into
play<00:00:43.879> essentially<00:00:44.879> both<00:00:45.329> weight<00:00:45.600> lifting

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
play essentially both weight lifting

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
play essentially both weight lifting
hooks<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.530> straps<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> same<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.820> they

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
hooks and straps do the same thing they

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.630 
hooks and straps do the same thing they
kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.300> help<00:00:48.840> handle<00:00:49.350> help<00:00:49.860> transfer<00:00:50.340> some

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
kind of help handle help transfer some

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.209 
kind of help handle help transfer some
of<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> weight<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> hands<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
of the weight from the hands to the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.590 
of the weight from the hands to the
wrists<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> forearms<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.480> you're

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
wrists and forearms so that you're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.209 
wrists and forearms so that you're
you're<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.199> kind<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.800> weights<00:00:55.980> just

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you're just kind of the weights just

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
you're just kind of the weights just
hanging<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> wrists<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.780> don't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
hanging off the wrists and you don't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
hanging off the wrists and you don't
have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> rely<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:59.039> grip<00:00:59.250> strength

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
have to rely as much on grip strength

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.590 
have to rely as much on grip strength
but<00:00:59.640> there's<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:00:59.969> bit<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.329> difference

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
but there's a little bit of a difference

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.209 
but there's a little bit of a difference
between<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.739> weight<00:01:01.890> lifting

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
between the two so the weight lifting

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
between the two so the weight lifting
hook<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> metal<00:01:03.239> hook<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.960> forms

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
hook is a metal hook that kind of forms

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
hook is a metal hook that kind of forms
underneath<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.189> hand<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.790> attached<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
underneath the hand and is attached to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
underneath the hand and is attached to
the<00:01:06.450> wrist<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> hook<00:01:07.439> basically

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the wrist so the hook basically

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
the wrist so the hook basically
eliminates<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.820> need<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.000> any<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.720> grip

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
eliminates the need for any kind of grip

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.480 
eliminates the need for any kind of grip
strength<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.530> basically<00:01:10.770> takes<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
strength because it basically takes all

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
strength because it basically takes all
the<00:01:11.939> load<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.479> applies<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.409> your<00:01:13.530> wrist<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the load and applies it to your wrist so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
the load and applies it to your wrist so
you<00:01:14.369> still<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.970> careful<00:01:15.210> because

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you still want to be careful because

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
you still want to be careful because
it's<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.869> heavy<00:01:16.080> load<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.890> wrist

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's a heavy load to have on your wrist

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
it's a heavy load to have on your wrist
and<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.430> can't<00:01:17.729> handle<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> weight<00:01:18.299> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and if you can't handle the weight you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
and if you can't handle the weight you
know<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> may<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.040> drop<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> weight<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
know you may want to drop the weight a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
know you may want to drop the weight a
little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.890> try<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.369> your

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
little bit and try to do it with your

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.310 
little bit and try to do it with your
regular<00:01:23.640> grip<00:01:24.000> strength<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.810> weight<00:01:24.990> lifting

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
regular grip strength so weight lifting

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.660 
regular grip strength so weight lifting
straps<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.770> slightly<00:01:26.009> different<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.520> that

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
straps are slightly different in that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
straps are slightly different in that
you<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.540> use<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.960> grip<00:01:28.229> strength

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you do have to use some grip strength

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
you do have to use some grip strength
but<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.040> assist<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.299> bit<00:01:30.420> if

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
but they do assist you a little bit if

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.090 
but they do assist you a little bit if
there<00:01:30.900> isn't<00:01:31.049> quite<00:01:31.350> enough<00:01:31.590> grip<00:01:31.799> strength

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
there isn't quite enough grip strength

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
there isn't quite enough grip strength
so<00:01:32.250> basically<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.759> weight<00:01:32.909> lifting<00:01:33.240> straps

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so basically the weight lifting straps

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
so basically the weight lifting straps
are<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> strap<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> wraps<00:01:34.920> around<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.640> wrist

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
are a strap that wraps around the wrist

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.539 
are a strap that wraps around the wrist
and<00:01:36.240> then<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.350> wrap<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.650> around<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.340> bar

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and then you can wrap it around the bar

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.670 
and then you can wrap it around the bar
so<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> takes<00:01:39.360> some<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.869> load<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so it takes some of the load off the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
so it takes some of the load off the
hands<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.340> moves<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> over<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> wrist<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
hands and moves it over to the wrist so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.569 
hands and moves it over to the wrist so
if<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> having<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> little<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.399> trouble

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
if you having a little bit of trouble

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219 
if you having a little bit of trouble
with<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> weight<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.049> weight

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
with the weight you're the weight

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
with the weight you're the weight
lifting<00:01:46.560> strap<00:01:46.770> should<00:01:47.040> help<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> good<00:01:47.670> deal

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
lifting strap should help a good deal

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.340 
lifting strap should help a good deal
and<00:01:48.210> be<00:01:48.329> able<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> handle<00:01:48.960> weight<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.259> you're

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
straps over the hooks because grip

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.270
