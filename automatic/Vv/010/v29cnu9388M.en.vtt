00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.259
 So of course you are the first one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.259
 normal horse sport 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.650
 You can decide for yourself how high 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.230
 I wanted to talk at the bottom 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 I will not look as nice so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.190
 make him go a bit further 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 Above really pay attention that the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.780
 Hair is really well laid out with it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.690
 you later at the surfaces no 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.080
 has trouble then you take that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.640
 does kissel 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.430
 There are small and big ones here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 take a relatively big 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.300
 there are even bigger ones for a bit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 taken me 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.070
 Now you just throw the hair like that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.360
 over and start doing it right 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 now you just need one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.440
 single bobby pins take one 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.340
 strand and crib the cliffs and 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.340
 moored here 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.710
 that's your very first one 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.939
 streak with which he tackles so badly 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.939
 we maybe a normal to 3 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.000
 catch us now insert here 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.220
 the principle is that you from the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.260
 always a strand on the left side 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.670
 takes and from the right but not soon that 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.860
 let's do that cliff then down 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.610
 late 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.610
 and if you have to, maybe now 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.540
 minimal in the beginning so relaxed approach 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.540
 later we're as solid pieces 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.930
 when we arrived at the end 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.990
 Maybe you just normal and 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.990
 Has 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.020
 yes you can rate them a bit weird 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.620
 but you will see what 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.620
 comes out of it 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.820
 then simply wrap the zoff four 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.820
 hide 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.780
 I use with my sister now 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.690
 These ballet hair clasps because they are very 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 Thick hair had since offered that 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.020
 very good otherwise you can of course 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.020
 use this normal 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.650
 and then you start the hairstyle 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.219
 determine so pull that off 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.219
 just down 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.340
 of pinning 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.800
 so and so the finished early looks like this 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.590
 I take them also like the crowns 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.050
 hairstyle just a nice one 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.050
 braid over such a point 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.530
 I like it you if there are 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.270
 please give me a thumbs up and 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.450
 then see what the next video 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.450
 again
