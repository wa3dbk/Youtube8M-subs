00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
this robot is the one that stands out to

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.140 
this robot is the one that stands out to
me<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.859> most<00:03:14.950> because<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.850> one<00:03:15.970> that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
me the most because it's the one that

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.860 
me the most because it's the one that
finishes<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.709> word<00:03:17.709> RuvA<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.090> believe

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
finishes the word RuvA so I believe

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.199 
finishes the word RuvA so I believe
because<00:03:20.350> Maxis<00:03:21.040> was<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.280> one<00:03:21.430> who<00:03:21.670> invented

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
because Maxis was the one who invented

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.750 
because Maxis was the one who invented
the<00:03:22.420> robot<00:03:22.810> or<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.620> giant<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.430> whatever<00:03:24.670> you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
the robot or the giant or whatever you

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.660 
the robot or the giant or whatever you
want<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> call<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.829> believe<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.370> because

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
want to call it I believe that because

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.030 
want to call it I believe that because
he<00:03:27.880> was<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.090> one<00:03:28.209> who<00:03:28.239> wanted<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.680> who<00:03:29.680> created

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
he was the one who wanted to who created

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.729 
he was the one who wanted to who created
that<00:03:30.720> richtofen<00:03:31.720> in<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.930> audio<00:03:32.170> quote<00:03:32.410> said

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
that richtofen in the audio quote said

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.240 
that richtofen in the audio quote said
he<00:03:33.549> wishes<00:03:33.760> he<00:03:34.030> was<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.299> one<00:03:34.510> who<00:03:35.130> created<00:03:36.130> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
he wishes he was the one who created the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
he wishes he was the one who created the
egg<00:03:36.310> moving<00:03:36.609> robot<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.329> assume<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:37.690> means

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
egg moving robot so I assume that means

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.660 
egg moving robot so I assume that means
he<00:03:38.260> was<00:03:38.410> pissed<00:03:38.650> at<00:03:38.769> maxis<00:03:39.280> for<00:03:39.430> actually

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
he was pissed at maxis for actually

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.370 
he was pissed at maxis for actually
taking<00:03:39.819> that<00:03:40.090> idea<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.750> he<00:03:40.900> wishes<00:03:41.049> he<00:03:41.290> was

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
taking that idea and he wishes he was

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.259 
taking that idea and he wishes he was
one<00:03:41.560> who<00:03:41.650> came<00:03:41.799> up<00:03:41.950> with<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.130> himself<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:43.120> that

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
one who came up with it himself so that

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.870 
one who came up with it himself so that
means<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.810> basically<00:03:44.100> Richthofen<00:03:45.100> was<00:03:45.639> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
means that basically Richthofen was the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.160 
means that basically Richthofen was the
one<00:03:46.000> who<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.209> originally<00:03:46.690> supposed<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.019> come

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
one who was originally supposed to come

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.900 
one who was originally supposed to come
up<00:03:47.200> with<00:03:47.290> an<00:03:47.440> idea<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:47.889> but<00:03:48.370> Maxis<00:03:48.730> took

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
up with an idea like that but Maxis took

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.690 
up with an idea like that but Maxis took
it<00:03:49.030> from<00:03:49.120> him<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.480> he<00:03:50.049> was<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.380> on<00:03:50.700> able

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
it from him and he was there on able

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.220 
it from him and he was there on able
from<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:51.970> point<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.239> keep<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.870> idea

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
from that point to keep that idea

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620 
from that point to keep that idea
produced<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.920> robot<00:03:54.280> from<00:03:54.910> under<00:03:55.150> Richthofen

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
produced the robot from under Richthofen

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.660 
produced the robot from under Richthofen
snows<00:03:55.930> he<00:03:56.319> didn't<00:03:56.530> even<00:03:56.620> know<00:03:56.829> about<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.069> when

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
snows he didn't even know about it when

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.370 
snows he didn't even know about it when
they<00:03:57.790> were<00:03:57.910> making<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.359> into<00:03:58.540> Reese<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
they were making it into Reese so the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.830 
they were making it into Reese so the
real<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.730> real<00:04:00.760> project<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.450> Max<00:04:01.690> was

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
real the real project that Max was

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
real the real project that Max was
actually<00:04:02.200> working<00:04:02.349> on<00:04:02.590> other<00:04:02.739> than<00:04:03.040> bringing

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
actually working on other than bringing

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.920 
actually working on other than bringing
the<00:04:03.970> dead<00:04:04.150> back<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.419> life<00:04:04.950> was<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.340> actually

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
the dead back to life was to actually

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.220 
the dead back to life was to actually
build<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.109> gigantic<00:04:08.560> giant<00:04:08.980> for<00:04:09.930> purposes<00:04:10.930> for

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
build a gigantic giant for purposes for

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.379 
build a gigantic giant for purposes for
ruled<00:04:11.470> for<00:04:12.069> world<00:04:12.250> domination<00:04:12.700> because<00:04:13.239> as

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
ruled for world domination because as

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.929 
ruled for world domination because as
you<00:04:13.480> may<00:04:13.599> know<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:15.069> end<00:04:15.310> games<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:15.819> both

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:15.939 
you may know in the end games for both

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.819 
you may know in the end games for both
of<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.120> buried<00:04:16.329> easter<00:04:16.450> eggs<00:04:16.829> Richthofen

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
of the buried easter eggs Richthofen

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.490 
of the buried easter eggs Richthofen
actually<00:04:18.099> proves<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.820> be<00:04:18.849> evil<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:20.440> does

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
actually proves to be evil and so does

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.180 
actually proves to be evil and so does
max's

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
max's

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.920 
max's
but<00:04:21.549> Max's<00:04:21.910> proves<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.240> be<00:04:22.270> more<00:04:22.390> evil<00:04:22.750> than

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
but Max's proves to be more evil than

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.570 
but Max's proves to be more evil than
Richthofen<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:23.920> thought<00:04:24.190> that<00:04:24.370> both<00:04:24.520> of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
Richthofen and I thought that both of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.460 
Richthofen and I thought that both of
them<00:04:24.760> are<00:04:24.880> actually<00:04:25.000> or<00:04:25.870> sir<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.080> thought<00:04:26.350> that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
them are actually or sir I thought that

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.510 
them are actually or sir I thought that
Richtofen<00:04:26.890> was<00:04:26.980> actually<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.280> one<00:04:27.310> who<00:04:27.460> was

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
Richtofen was actually the one who was

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.100 
Richtofen was actually the one who was
only<00:04:27.730> evil<00:04:27.790> but<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.210> turns<00:04:28.360> out<00:04:28.450> max's<00:04:28.840> is<00:04:28.960> way

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
only evil but it turns out max's is way

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.780 
only evil but it turns out max's is way
more<00:04:29.260> evil<00:04:29.560> than<00:04:29.590> Richthofen<00:04:30.160> because<00:04:30.670> he

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
more evil than Richthofen because he

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.160 
more evil than Richthofen because he
just<00:04:31.120> wanted<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.390> destroy<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.780> world<00:04:31.930> however

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
just wanted to destroy the world however

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.930 
just wanted to destroy the world however
Richthofen<00:04:32.680> wants<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:32.920> take<00:04:33.070> over<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:33.820> that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
Richthofen wants to take over it so that

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700 
Richthofen wants to take over it so that
still<00:04:34.060> gives<00:04:34.150> people<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.510> chance<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.990> survive

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
still gives people a chance to survive

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.850 
still gives people a chance to survive
but<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.670> it's<00:04:37.360> Max's<00:04:37.810> he<00:04:37.990> is<00:04:38.290> gonna<00:04:38.470> destroy

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
but if it's Max's he is gonna destroy

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.940 
but if it's Max's he is gonna destroy
the<00:04:39.010> world<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:39.910> he<00:04:40.570> wanted<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:40.930> robot<00:04:41.800> for

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
the world so he wanted the robot for

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.040 
the world so he wanted the robot for
whatever<00:04:42.190> his<00:04:42.400> evil<00:04:42.670> needs<00:04:43.270> were<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.600> be<00:04:43.780> and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
whatever his evil needs were to be and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.200 
whatever his evil needs were to be and
he<00:04:44.590> was<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.830> one<00:04:44.950> who<00:04:44.980> invented<00:04:45.670> that<00:04:45.820> robot

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
he was the one who invented that robot

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.270 
he was the one who invented that robot
does<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.810> mean<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.020> rubra<00:04:47.620> is<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.100> name<00:04:48.250> of

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
does that mean that rubra is the name of

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.770 
does that mean that rubra is the name of
the<00:04:48.430> robot<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:48.820> does<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.330> mean<00:04:49.480> that<00:04:49.510> that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
the robot and does that mean that that

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.210 
the robot and does that mean that that
robot<00:04:50.200> is<00:04:50.470> supposed<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.980> be<00:04:51.070> keeping

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
robot is supposed to be keeping

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.070 
robot is supposed to be keeping
something<00:04:51.610> warm<00:04:52.030> or<00:04:52.270> something<00:04:52.570> hidden<00:04:52.810> away

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
something warm or something hidden away

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.960 
something warm or something hidden away
from<00:04:53.230> everybody<00:04:53.620> else<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.370> not<00:04:54.520> be<00:04:54.670> able<00:04:54.760> to

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
from everybody else to not be able to

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.940 
from everybody else to not be able to
take<00:04:55.150> from<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.630> that<00:04:56.380> I'm<00:04:56.560> thinking<00:04:56.860> maybe

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
take from it and that I'm thinking maybe

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.470 
take from it and that I'm thinking maybe
it's<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.280> Easter<00:04:57.640> egg<00:04:57.670> maybe<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.060> gonna<00:04:58.150> try

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
it's the Easter egg maybe it's gonna try

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.210 
it's the Easter egg maybe it's gonna try
and<00:04:58.630> stop<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.020> from<00:04:59.110> figuring<00:04:59.350> it<00:04:59.680> out<00:04:59.770> or

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
and stop you from figuring it out or

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.340 
and stop you from figuring it out or
maybe<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.550> some<00:05:00.820> way<00:05:00.970> shape<00:05:01.180> or<00:05:01.300> form<00:05:01.360> rufa<00:05:02.230> the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
maybe in some way shape or form rufa the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.510 
maybe in some way shape or form rufa the
robot<00:05:02.710> that's<00:05:02.950> what<00:05:03.070> we're<00:05:03.160> gonna<00:05:03.220> call<00:05:03.460> it

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
robot that's what we're gonna call it

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.690 
robot that's what we're gonna call it
right<00:05:03.730> now<00:05:03.820> maybe<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.570> Navy<00:05:05.200> RuvA<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:06.430> has

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
right now maybe the Navy RuvA it has

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.070 
right now maybe the Navy RuvA it has
something<00:05:06.970> really<00:05:07.450> big<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.660> do<00:05:07.870> with<00:05:07.990> the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
something really big to do with the

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.050 
something really big to do with the
storyline<00:05:08.590> other<00:05:08.890> than<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.580> block<00:05:09.820> you

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
storyline other than just to block you

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.540 
storyline other than just to block you
and<00:05:10.210> stop<00:05:10.420> you<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.810> like<00:05:11.800> screw<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.250> up<00:05:12.310> from

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
and stop you and like screw you up from

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.650 
and stop you and like screw you up from
getting<00:05:12.760> around<00:05:12.850> places<00:05:13.420> when<00:05:13.540> you're

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
getting around places when you're

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.740 
getting around places when you're
playing<00:05:13.930> through<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.890> new<00:05:15.040> map<00:05:15.220> origins<00:05:15.750> so

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
playing through the new map origins so

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080 
playing through the new map origins so
maybe<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.110> robot<00:05:17.740> actually<00:05:18.010> takes<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.520> way

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
maybe this robot actually takes a way

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.520 
maybe this robot actually takes a way
bigger<00:05:19.300> effect<00:05:19.480> on<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.840> storyline<00:05:20.260> then<00:05:20.440> we

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
bigger effect on the storyline then we

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.500 
bigger effect on the storyline then we
all<00:05:20.680> think<00:05:20.920> and<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.700> personally<00:05:22.090> think<00:05:22.390> that

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
all think and I personally think that

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.850 
all think and I personally think that
this<00:05:22.720> theory<00:05:22.990> makes<00:05:23.230> a<00:05:23.350> decent<00:05:23.500> amount<00:05:23.680> of

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
this theory makes a decent amount of

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.350 
this theory makes a decent amount of
sense<00:05:24.040> just<00:05:24.370> considering<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.820> fact<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.150> the

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
sense just considering the fact that the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.230 
sense just considering the fact that the
audio<00:05:25.990> quote<00:05:26.200> itself<00:05:26.550> dhruva<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:28.060> word

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
audio quote itself dhruva the word

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.060 
audio quote itself dhruva the word
spelling<00:05:28.540> you<00:05:28.660> know<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:29.230> definition<00:05:29.680> of<00:05:29.919> him

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
spelling you know the definition of him

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.820 
spelling you know the definition of him
and<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.580> robot<00:05:30.940> all<00:05:31.150> put<00:05:31.600> together<00:05:31.960> makes<00:05:32.680> a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
and the robot all put together makes a

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.230 
and the robot all put together makes a
decent<00:05:33.010> amount<00:05:33.190> of<00:05:33.370> sense<00:05:33.550> sailor<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.120> all

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
decent amount of sense sailor and it all

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.270 
decent amount of sense sailor and it all
plays<00:05:34.510> out<00:05:34.660> just<00:05:34.900> perfectly<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.830> think<00:05:36.010> that

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
plays out just perfectly so I think that

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.130 
plays out just perfectly so I think that
this<00:05:36.520> robot<00:05:37.030> could<00:05:37.450> actually<00:05:37.630> be<00:05:37.900> something

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
this robot could actually be something

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.110 
this robot could actually be something
that<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:39.220> has<00:05:39.370> been<00:05:39.550> around<00:05:39.640> since<00:05:39.910> the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
that is that has been around since the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.659 
that is that has been around since the
beginning<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.169> reefs<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.620> Max<00:05:42.460> has

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
beginning of the reefs and Max has

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.810 
beginning of the reefs and Max has
produced<00:05:43.180> this<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.510> maybe<00:05:43.630> stop<00:05:43.960> Richthofen

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
produced this to maybe stop Richthofen

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.400 
produced this to maybe stop Richthofen
from<00:05:45.820> taking<00:05:46.450> over<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.750> world<00:05:46.870> like<00:05:47.110> he<00:05:47.290> may

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
from taking over the world like he may

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.470 
from taking over the world like he may
have<00:05:47.440> thought<00:05:47.620> he<00:05:47.830> wanted<00:05:48.070> to<00:05:48.190> do<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.580> maybe

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
have thought he wanted to do and maybe

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.390 
have thought he wanted to do and maybe
this<00:05:49.690> is<00:05:49.900> this<00:05:50.110> max<00:05:50.470> is<00:05:50.680> his<00:05:50.800> way<00:05:50.950> of<00:05:50.980> trying<00:05:51.280> to

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
this is this max is his way of trying to

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.070 
this is this max is his way of trying to
get<00:05:51.550> back<00:05:51.640> at<00:05:51.700> Richthofen<00:05:52.390> so<00:05:52.750> if<00:05:52.810> we're<00:05:52.960> going

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
get back at Richthofen so if we're going

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.930 
get back at Richthofen so if we're going
back<00:05:53.260> in<00:05:53.440> time<00:05:53.590> maybe<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:53.950> robot<00:05:54.640> is<00:05:54.669> gonna

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
back in time maybe this robot is gonna

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.520 
back in time maybe this robot is gonna
stop<00:05:55.240> him<00:05:55.390> before<00:05:55.510> he<00:05:55.750> completely<00:05:56.110> takes<00:05:56.320> over

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
stop him before he completely takes over

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.810 
stop him before he completely takes over
I<00:05:56.830> don't<00:05:57.190> know<00:05:57.250> leave<00:05:57.400> your<00:05:57.520> thoughts<00:05:57.669> and

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
about this this is just a theory guys I

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.280 
about this this is just a theory guys I
don't<00:06:01.060> think<00:06:01.360> this<00:06:01.450> is<00:06:01.510> actually<00:06:01.870> real<00:06:02.050> rhyme

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
don't think this is actually real rhyme

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.770 
don't think this is actually real rhyme
this<00:06:02.950> could<00:06:03.220> be<00:06:03.250> on<00:06:03.580> this<00:06:03.970> easily<00:06:04.240> could<00:06:04.419> be<00:06:04.540> a

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
this could be on this easily could be a

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.740 
this could be on this easily could be a
like<00:06:05.410> wrong<00:06:05.680> but<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.220> think<00:06:06.340> this<00:06:06.700> is<00:06:06.850> this

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
like wrong but I think this is this

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.210 
like wrong but I think this is this
makes<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:08.050> nice<00:06:08.140> amount<00:06:08.350> of<00:06:08.500> sense<00:06:08.680> leave<00:06:09.100> your

notice<00:06:19.720> but<00:06:19.840> some<00:06:19.990> people<00:06:20.200> because<00:06:20.440> I<00:06:20.470> think

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
notice but some people because I think

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.320 
notice but some people because I think
that<00:06:20.919> this<00:06:21.040> theory<00:06:21.550> is<00:06:21.700> something<00:06:22.150> that<00:06:22.240> a<00:06:22.300> lot

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
that this theory is something that a lot

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.490 
that this theory is something that a lot
of<00:06:22.480> people<00:06:22.570> should<00:06:22.870> know<00:06:22.960> about<00:06:23.080> because<00:06:23.350> it's

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
of people should know about because it's
