00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.160
 Hello, my name is Christina 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.680
 Kameneva St. Petersburg School 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.960
 television I teach makeup in this 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.510
 I would like to show you a bright lesson 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.580
 creative color makeup given makeup 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.310
 you can use during the photo shoot 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.740
 for example to perform this color 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 I will use different types of makeup 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.970
 make-up and face painting 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.160
 and cream greasy make-up start with 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 color dark shade take 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.809
 We take a bright shade of purple 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.270
 synthetic brush using wet 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.160
 brush impose a bright color tint 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.010
 We try to work in parallel to 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:50.149
 eyes turned out symmetrically as 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.789
 basis choose face painting and lay 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.860
 first major 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.289
 formative touches with colored makeup 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.020
 green should be stirred to the consistency 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.690
 liquid sour cream 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.489
 because it should not be very dry and he 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.380
 should not be very liquid what was not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.939
 spread out 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.880
 we fill it to get us 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.889
 color and dry brush try it 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.959
 shade to make color 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.299
 even brighter on top of us 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.009
 we can lay the shadows dry pressed 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.130
 the shadows 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.929
 choose the shade we need and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:31.479
 we put it on top of the makeup 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:34.090
 flat brush shadows try to fill 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.669
 prints so that they are smoother and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 saturation lay down in order to 

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:41.200
 the transition was softer we can take 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.090
 some intermediate shade 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.359
 for example pink and pave it slightly 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 higher as if overlapping the previous 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.819
 purple continue to the next 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.979
 color we will use yellow 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.169
 the shade of the shadows and in order that he lay down 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.429
 more bright more saturated 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:03.950
 use white fat makeup for this 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.079
 we use a synthetic brush and with 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.959
 using it we put makeup on everything 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.240
 movable eyelid now lay out yellow 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.310
 a shade of shadow on top of our white makeup 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.860
 the next transition shade will be 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:23.060
 peach finishes shade pink 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.800
 so that eye makeup does not look separate 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.560
 from the whole face you can shade 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.070
 some makeup items on the face in that 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.560
 including 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.150
 that is, you take a dry shade 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.840
 corrector is quite saturated and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.340
 Stretch the shading on whiskey 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.230
 face correction 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.710
 the next stage is eyeliner wet 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.210
 brush type dry eyeliner paint 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.210
 sufficiently active arrows 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.740
 lower eyelid also make out eyeliner and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.740
 make double arrow 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.830
 we can duplicate the mucous with black 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.159
 pencil to the eye looked 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.140
 more expressively the space between 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.849
 with arrows we can land with 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.200
 same white makeup to 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.799
 glare enhance we can add 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.690
 nacreous friable shadows such 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.400
 makeup will look more expressive 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 if you add it overhead 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.269
 eyelash glue is applied to the base 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.849
 cilia on rib 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.209
 thin layer 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.060
 convenient to use with a toothpick 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.530
 or any thin stick 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.359
 you can also just gently go around 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.549
 cilium in glue close our eyes and 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.989
 apply eyelash 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.510
 carefully glue the eyelashes at 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.239
 inner corner of the outer 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.599
 well, we press eyes do not open until 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.829
 until the cilia go out 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.959
 the final stage of our makeup will be 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.660
 applying blush 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.000
 highlighter and bronzer corrective 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.190
 powder blush also choose bright 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.720
 as much as we have bright color 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.720
 Make up color try to pick so 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.669
 so that it fits our shadows further 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.650
 impose a light shade over the cheekbones 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:30.810
 apply dark corrective powder under 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.669
 cheekbones to emphasize their lips themselves 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.360
 enough to cover the transparent glitter 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.190
 since the focus on our eyes and lips is not 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.000
 must be made very bright 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.160
 All our makeup is ready more about this and 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.870
 any other kind of makeup 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.610
 I will tell you with pleasure on 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.610
 our courses come to us for training
