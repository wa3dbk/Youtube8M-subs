00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.399
 today we are going to make some lollipops 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.349
 brioche with ferrero rocher flavor 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.599
 we have done using drunken dough 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.130
 crunchy and almond nutella and 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 chocolate sprinkles 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.869
 the brioche dough I made yesterday you have 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 the recipe in the description of the video and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.310
 in this note that you see aside what 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.500
 we have done in our other channel in 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 super madraza there are many more 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.700
 recipes for cooking and basic cooking well 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.770
 Well now what we do is take it 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.680
 the bubbles the air bubbles that 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.899
 they remain in the dough when the dough rises 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.000
 we remove them and to remove those from 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.120
 all we do is sprinkle with 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.480
 flour the work table and we knead 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.330
 well the dough in such a way I like it 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.880
 lift it and hit it on the table 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.740
 that way I get all the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.740
 bubbles disappear 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.530
 all right 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.250
 with the roller we stretch the dough and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.430
 let's put with a rectangular shape 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.900
 we cut a little bit what's left and now 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.150
 What we do is start putting 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.560
 nutella nutella cream is also worth 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 nocilla although nutella is more 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 similar to what is the filling of the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.710
 ferrero rocher and we extend by our 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710
 rectangle 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.950
 Now sprinkle with the crispy and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.480
 almond you know that these chocolates 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.140
 They have a lot of crunchy and almond 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.730
 around well then once we have 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.369
 sprinkled well for all our 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.070
 rectangle we proceed to roll up our 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.550
 Mass is like a gypsy arm 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.870
 and we are winding little by little 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.209
 trying to make it tight 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.209
 we are squeezing while we roll 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.019
 ah 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.440
 Well now we are going to cut 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.569
 thin slices and I say thin because then 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.849
 the mass will grow then if we want 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.950
 have a few pirouettes 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.599
 decent sized you can make them 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.480
 finite because then the dough will bend 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.510
 its volume we cut with scissors is with 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.550
 knife is cut fatal good so let's go 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 cutting up 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.540
 everything is our roll in 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.100
 different slices because in addition to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.390
 lollipops we will also do as a few 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.390
 cupcakes you are going to see 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.160
 we went to a baking tray in which 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.230
 we will have put a baking paper for 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.330
 keep them from sticking and you see 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.490
 we are going puncturing a skewer by the side 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.490
 that does not have a tip in each of 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.860
 our slices and sprinkle with more 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.260
 and crispy almond 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.010
 to make the cupcakes we are going to put 3 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.970
 slices the first one aside and then the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.830
 other 2 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.960
 if the slices in the same size will rise 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.270
 all at once if we had an area 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.070
 more than another, what we have done 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.860
 we have made cupcakes we have made 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.070
 only slices on top of the paper 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.410
 of oven and lollipops and everything we are going to 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.840
 put crispy and let's wait in a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.580
 site closed in the oven for example to 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.490
 double its volume and if the oven 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.590
 we put 50 degrees better once we 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.760
 have doubled the volume we apply a 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.040
 little beaten egg 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.989
 so that it also shines then we went to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.909
 also put a few pinches of chocolate 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.439
 so they know more fijaros chocolate 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.819
 we are wanting to imitate the 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.400
 ferrero rocher chocolates 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.560
 Well, we put about 10 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 minutes at 180 degrees until they're 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.190
 golden to us have happened to us 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.780
 even a tad of gold I like a 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.330
 but less so they are very rich 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.240
 look at the cupcakes and our 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.220
 lollipops then nothing if you liked the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.190
 video to give I like it of course to me 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.560
 these cupcakes brioche de ferrero 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 Rocher, they seem like a marvel 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.940
 I can not stop eating them
