00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.660
 just the speech and the lera hayashi that I always 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.550
 To you another video game play 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.400
 commented and today's video is again 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.199
 about call of duty black ops 2 and in that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.410
 video I want to explain to you how that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.119
 is working hard punk there and in box 2 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 on the English version 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.210
 and for those who play trash in Portuguese o 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 project calls hard line was not so 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.449
 that they translated the name of the people nor 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.480
 translate verbatim let's talk 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.920
 so many people are in doubt as to how 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 this one because it's really working 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 for those who do not know who is in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 doubt and it has always existed in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 franchise code always the best 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 it has been a long time since he was 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.899
 introduced in module f2 I can not remember 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
 already had almost 4 and on Saturday 5 I think 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.770
 I do not think the first code that 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.750
 appeared was the f250 model was pardon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 but it's been a long time since he was 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 present on the coast franchise in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 multiplayer franchise can it serves to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.879
 that it serves to make your life easier 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 at the time you pick up your kits on or 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the case of bancoop from its coffers 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 only in block 2 it is not from a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.080
 different way to mode an affair 3 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.760
 How do you know the kill system? 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.540
 game reward switch was 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 different 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.360
 so much that now the block including 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 change the personal name I think really 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.750
 is different from other cuts like 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.979
 I explained several times in the pictures 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 previous and even a defeat by three 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 agents to earn rewards basically 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 just by killing on w3c agent 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.740
 capital a flag or something of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 was also rewarded with a point in the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.610
 system of fixed points as the largest 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 part of the awa but was very similar 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.150
 because we already had a copy of the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 model f 2 and who will donate and make 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 make you need only 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.970
 one less point or a burning - case 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 We're talking about backoffice mw2 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.460
 so do not 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.259
 It's for you to take your own Christ. 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 for example has a headline that is 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149
 third with 7 kills and no seven points 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.369
 whether you 're using it by carli or 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.740
 so you reach 6 who used six points 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.869
 You already catch the politician do not need 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.119
 get on set then basically online 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.490
 always served to facilitate his life in the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.960
 It's time for you to take your christ and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.060
 Inocoop 2 goes there and continues with the same 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.939
 right function still has the objective 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.469
 main eliete help catch or 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.509
 your next cut in a more 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.799
 easy but it works in a way 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.149
 different right 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.160
 the base you have to know soon 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.640
 face that gives now guarani does not make 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.010
 that the sport you want to get is 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.630
 with less school with fewer points in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.240
 case and if it makes you earn a 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.040
 bonus points are more for all 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.920
 actions you do in the game 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.330
 or theoretically neopar carla which 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.310
 of the two is superior to all others 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.709
 by charles that already appeared in the front 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.959
 that piri because he helped you so much 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.060
 giving bonus christmas not always advantage 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.130
 only in a fixed way as in the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.480
 other good codes to demonstrate everything 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.620
 This, for you, I recorded an excerpt from 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.380
 here on the internet 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.270
 showing to you is is used by 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.520
 caroline how really easy it is 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.430
 you pick up a certain cut-trick 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.560
 is using it right and I used it as 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.840
 examples in this background that you 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.519
 They are seeing the cartel cuts and vina 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.769
 I want to play more in pt br 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.260
 I want the answer 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.880
 this I'm not mistaken I think this is and is 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.519
 the next as you know how much I 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 I saw him get caught with 600 schools tribune 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.489
 600 points 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 that is if you have been playing nation for 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.320
 example as the background case is the people 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.030
 pick it up with 6 kills, not 6 that the basics 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.830
 normal schools without being close to the 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 bathroom or something of the type 76 that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.700
 normal and skills 100 points 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.489
 using the cartel and we'll get it 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.320
 with exact five that why the 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.810
 radio there he is giving a bonus of 20 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.299
 percent for all actions that you 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.310
 makes inside the black ops 2 multiplayer 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.019
 that is if you earn 100 points per uncle 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.269
 but you are using radar online you 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.260
 consequently, it will gain 120 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.000
 points per kilometer 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.950
 playing in a field are with by 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.630
 carini ie making a quick account 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.010
 and we do 125 that gives 600 or so 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 get the control and we need a 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.930
 bed - using punk hard on 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.209
 and then you're going to say fuck but I 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.980
 I did not see that much advantage because in 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.880
 lower tests do not feel as 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.320
 difference and such 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.180
 really maybe that's where it gets more 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.910
 down in scotland the lower you do not 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.920
 feel so different, but as the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.470
 people know is the cutting system bope 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.180
 two is very comprehensive do not talk like that 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.700
 You get points for all kinds of 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.410
 action you do right now and he 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.329
 has that system of 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.940
 costs so you arrive at a more 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.780
 tall that you have in the case but already 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.979
 reached the necessary points for 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.510
 achieve all three 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.430
 you start to reach the points all of 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.720
 new you get from the last is the 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.370
 second third and thus 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.260
 consequently until you die, right? 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.850
 beginning will donate blood can be well 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.130
 if you are a player who can 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.990
 stay for a long time you have the 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.640
 highline with you help in your 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.050
 frames that will be very useful 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.700
 You will not even realize it, but he'll do it. 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.500
 a very big difference and obviously 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.150
 it is even necessary to speak the difference that he 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.040
 It makes for when you have a very escort 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 right up if you will stop to think 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.120
 you do many actions during the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.250
 multiplayer will give you the point 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.660
 sure I used this example and show the 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.640
 how much did I just mark womack 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.860
 domination that draw point 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.210
 normally with harley 120 but not 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.970
 Your own name lets you capture a 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.180
 flag you get 200 points right 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:06.350
 with online radio you already win 240 is 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.420
 because 20% of 240 240 240 are already already 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.250
 40 points more for the entire catch 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.390
 The way you do you kill one. 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.490
 opponent while you're catching 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.870
 a flag is also 200 points with 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.090
 harley plus 40 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.770
 If you catch a flag it's all 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.590
 scene at the beginning of the round of that rate 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.260
 neutral henderson 50 points with aline 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.270
 20% more than 60 points understood 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.910
 if you take a kill from a guy who 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.310
 Flag capture is 125 points with 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.290
 20% of online value is now 150 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.460
 so the hardware actually does it 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.900
 difference understood 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.400
 You killed three guys today who are 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.530
 capturing a flag you will win 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.300
 75 points more than you get if 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.860
 you had not using online radar 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.150
 the cuts are well scored 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.130
 close on some committees 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.300
 broken we are not always scores 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.330
 so 600 700 and 800 and some 685 know 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.710
 I do not know how much 25 then these 75 points 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.300
 the more that the Guarani will give you 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.770
 Let's make the difference up front with 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.090
 as I said especially if you 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.490
 Are you using the sport any longer? 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.500
 powerful then the highline in my 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.850
 opinion is the strongest highline of all 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.260
 the history of the bodies nothing that you see 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.790
 page of type I'm talking about that he 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.350
 is stronger than he was one of the 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.420
 four and is most useful is a 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.250
 little more useful at the same time is in the 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.920
 lot 1 which in my opinion is a motto 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.390
 then the most powerful of the game then 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.340
 that choosing well has to pay attention 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.630
 in the way you play which one because you 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.190
 it's more beneficial to you 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.890
 but no doubt going there is a 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.210
 very useful park're so really I 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.580
 I recommend without using it 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.170
 if you like socialmx it will help you 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.670
 mainly in matches 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.550
 long and that you are using the 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.050
 high scores coaches good but not 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.580
 but this is what I wanted to go through 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.200
 this video today for you to explain 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.340
 How does the online market work? 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.199
 when I did a video explaining how 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.910
 the new ghost the feedback you have been much 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.500
 cool have been discussed a lot 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.210
 A lot of people kept asking for a series to 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.160
 I'm not creating a series explaining that 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.020
 like that how it works in 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.460
 The truth is not every game I 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.050
 I find it unnecessary to have multiple profiles 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.220
 People already know how it works 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.139
 but what I can do is ask 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.940
 suggestions to you then comment on this 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.500
 video here because you do not know the 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.600
 sure how it works if you have some 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.880
 questions and leave comments do not play 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.710
 in people's comments comment 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.000
 Because you care too much. 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.010
 probably farther forward 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.660
 making some more videos of this show 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.190
 here explaining how it works 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.669
 one determined why beauty then is 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.930
 that's right 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:16.760
 I hope you enjoyed this video if 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.350
 liked but want to leave your lexicon your 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.700
 favorite to help in the dissemination and 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.380
 value the work that has been bringing 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.090
 these videos here for you and I will 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:28.690
 staying here a hug to everyone 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.690
 stay with God and even be the most
