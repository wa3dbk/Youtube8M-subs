also change to spring reverb very very
nice<00:01:06.330> adding<00:01:06.659> reverb<00:01:06.780> works<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.680> really

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
nice adding reverb works really really

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
nice adding reverb works really really
well<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.280> each<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> these<00:01:09.119> knobs<00:01:09.450> now<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
well and each one of these knobs now is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
well and each one of these knobs now is
kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.290> has<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> notched<00:01:11.010> effect<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
kind of has like a notched effect on it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.700 
kind of has like a notched effect on it
so<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> turn<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.630> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> feel

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so as you turn it you can kind of feel

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
so as you turn it you can kind of feel
it<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.040> you're<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.340> around<00:01:14.430> i<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.880> they

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it as you're going around i think they

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.820 
it as you're going around i think they
said<00:01:15.270> their<00:01:15.450> survive<00:01:15.780> 21<00:01:16.229> different<00:01:16.500> notches

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
said their survive 21 different notches

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590
