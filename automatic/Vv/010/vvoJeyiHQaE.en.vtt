00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so like right now NBC has quills

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
so like right now NBC has quills
accuracy<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.659> drain<00:01:42.930> blood<00:01:45.079> will<00:01:46.079> heal

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
accuracy and drain blood will heal

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
accuracy and drain blood will heal
because<00:01:46.740> man<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.939> don't<00:01:48.420> take<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> 10%

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
because man you don't take that 10%

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.460 
because man you don't take that 10%
derby<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> hit<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.840> wilds<00:01:52.320> when

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
derby a hit that you do with wilds when

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.889 
derby a hit that you do with wilds when
you<00:01:52.590> face<00:01:53.040> her<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> now<00:01:53.549> NBC<00:01:54.000> has<00:01:54.210> quills

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you face her and now NBC has quills

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.679 
you face her and now NBC has quills
accuracy<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.590> reckless<00:01:55.890> strike<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.880> they're

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
accuracy and reckless strike so they're

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
accuracy and reckless strike so they're
based<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.710> mean<00:01:58.920> they're<00:01:59.310> based<00:01:59.490> off<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
based off I mean they're based off the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.319 
based off I mean they're based off the
pets<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
pets that they are you know but they the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.649 
pets that they are you know but they the
moves<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.630> will<00:02:03.750> change<00:02:03.960> every<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:05.659> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
moves that will change every time so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.050 
moves that will change every time so
sometimes<00:02:07.039> NBC<00:02:08.039> will<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.310> Hawkeye<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> lead

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
sometimes NBC will have Hawkeye and lead

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.369 
sometimes NBC will have Hawkeye and lead
off<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.360> Hawkeye<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.110> carry<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
off with Hawkeye so you can carry a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
off with Hawkeye so you can carry a
level<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:10.890> but

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
level one but

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.460 
level one but
I<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.569> think<00:02:12.689> it's<00:02:12.900> really<00:02:13.079> worth<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I don't think it's really worth it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.550 
I don't think it's really worth it

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
dispatch NBC very quickly and then we

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.710 
dispatch NBC very quickly and then we
have<00:02:34.859> now<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.099> Firefly<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.120> wonder<00:02:36.629> what

have now the Firefly and wonder what

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.240 
have now the Firefly and wonder what
that<00:02:36.900> could<00:02:37.019> possibly<00:02:37.739> would<00:02:37.920> be<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.069> reference

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
that could possibly would be a reference

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.740 
that could possibly would be a reference
to<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:44.430> only<00:02:44.609> I'm<00:02:44.760> not<00:02:44.970> sure<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.359> bones<00:02:45.569> is

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
to the only I'm not sure what bones is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.119 
to the only I'm not sure what bones is
supposed<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.049> be<00:02:46.139> your<00:02:46.260> reference<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.859> because

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
supposed to be your reference to because

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.379 
supposed to be your reference to because
I<00:02:47.250> figured<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.639> would<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.790> supposed<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.299> be

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
I figured it would be supposed to be

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.690 
I figured it would be supposed to be
fruiting<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.900> phones<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.440> Star<00:02:49.739> Trek<00:02:49.769> but<00:02:50.400> I'm

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
fruiting on phones on Star Trek but I'm

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.910 
fruiting on phones on Star Trek but I'm
not<00:02:50.879> totally<00:02:51.090> sure

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
not totally sure

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:04.399 
not totally sure
so<00:02:55.639> dispatch<00:02:56.639> mal<00:02:57.060> quickly<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.290> have

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
so dispatch mal quickly and if you have

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.440 
so dispatch mal quickly and if you have
a<00:03:04.439> decent<00:03:04.680> stable<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.310> fight<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:06.030> not<00:03:06.090> going

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
a decent stable this fight is not going

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.160 
a decent stable this fight is not going
to<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.629> very<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:07.349> of<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> challenge<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:09.170> think

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to be very much of a challenge I think

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.330 
to be very much of a challenge I think
this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.379> another<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.769> of<00:03:10.799> those<00:03:10.980> catch-up

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
this is another one of those catch-up

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.210 
this is another one of those catch-up
mostly<00:03:12.150> for<00:03:12.329> new<00:03:12.420> players<00:03:12.659> like<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.799> said<00:03:14.040> this

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
mostly for new players like I said this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.210 
mostly for new players like I said this
does<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.579> show<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.909> every<00:03:15.180> day<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.560> if<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.859> get

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
does not show up every day so if you get

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.849 
does not show up every day so if you get
a<00:03:17.250> chance<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.639> do<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.150> better<00:03:18.299> do<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:24.859> not

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
a chance to do it you better do it not

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.780 
a chance to do it you better do it not
