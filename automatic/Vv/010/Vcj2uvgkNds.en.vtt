00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
shaders for 1.7.2 now before I get

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.940 
shaders for 1.7.2 now before I get
started<00:00:11.120> it<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.570> beta<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.530> performance

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
started it is in beta so the performance

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
started it is in beta so the performance
and<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.730> quality<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> shaders<00:00:15.660> won't<00:00:16.049> be

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
and the quality of the shaders won't be

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.370 
and the quality of the shaders won't be
to<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> best<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.880> it'll<00:00:18.210> still<00:00:18.420> work<00:00:18.480> due<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to the best but it'll still work due to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.529

folder forage jar and the shaders mod
jar<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.120> shader<00:00:51.329> packs<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:52.559> basically<00:00:53.160> like

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
jar the shader packs are basically like

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
jar the shader packs are basically like
the<00:00:53.550> custom<00:00:53.969> presets<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.660> shaders<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.079> there

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the custom presets for shaders and there

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.430 
the custom presets for shaders and there
are<00:00:56.070> over<00:00:56.309> 46<00:00:57.000> things<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.870> work<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> my

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
are over 46 things they work on my

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
are over 46 things they work on my
computer<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.879> might<00:01:00.059> crash<00:01:00.329> yours<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
computer but they might crash yours I

computer but they might crash yours I
don't<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.020> depends<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.559> specs<00:01:01.890> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
don't know it depends on your specs so

if you don't already have a folder named

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
if you don't already have a folder named
mods<00:01:26.640> you'd<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> create<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> new<00:01:28.439> folder

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
mods you'd want to create a new folder

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.340 
mods you'd want to create a new folder
named<00:01:28.920> mods<00:01:29.159> all<00:01:29.400> lower<00:01:29.610> case<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:31.020> open

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
named mods all lower case and just open

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.310 
named mods all lower case and just open
up<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> folder<00:01:32.090> drag<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> drop<00:01:33.570> shaders

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
up the folder drag and drop shaders

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
up the folder drag and drop shaders
montecore<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:36.320> then<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.680> could<00:01:38.750> go<00:01:39.750> back

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
montecore into it then you could go back

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.520 
montecore into it then you could go back
and<00:01:40.759> you<00:01:41.759> should<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> drag

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and you should all I need to do is drag

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.740 
and you should all I need to do is drag
the<00:01:43.799> shader<00:01:44.130> pipes<00:01:44.430> folder<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.540> dot

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the shader pipes folder into your dot

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.580 
the shader pipes folder into your dot
minecraft<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:48.990> basically<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
minecraft and then that's basically it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.020 
minecraft and then that's basically it
you<00:01:49.710> want<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.430> start<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.880> your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you want to go and start up your

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.240 
you want to go and start up your
Minecraft<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.710> if<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.979> inking<00:01:56.759> login<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> if

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
Minecraft and if it inking login and if
it<00:01:59.430> hasn't<00:01:59.969> already<00:02:00.329> created<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.049> profile<00:02:01.500> name

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it hasn't already created a profile name

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
it hasn't already created a profile name
forage<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> want<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> new

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
profile use version and this should say

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.550 
profile use version and this should say
for<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.439> say<00:02:08.039> yeah<00:02:08.450> their<00:02:09.450> profile<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:09.989> let's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
for it say yeah their profile and let's
