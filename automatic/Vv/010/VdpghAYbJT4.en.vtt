00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.510 

let's<00:00:00.960> look<00:00:01.140> at<00:00:01.260> some<00:00:01.439> quantizing<00:00:02.040> examples

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
let's look at some quantizing examples

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.730 
let's look at some quantizing examples
and<00:00:02.730> by<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.210> way<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:04.140> might<00:00:04.319> hear<00:00:04.589> me

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
and by the way you might hear me

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.249 
and by the way you might hear me
dropping<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.430> terms<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.259> quantizing

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
dropping the terms of quantizing

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.310 
dropping the terms of quantizing
autocorrection<00:00:08.189> scale<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.450> resolution<00:00:10.080> kind

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
autocorrection scale and resolution kind

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.830

discussion<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.269> dr<00:00:15.630> 670<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.859> let's<00:00:17.250> drop

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
discussion of the dr 670 so let's drop

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.279 
discussion of the dr 670 so let's drop
out<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.970> these<00:00:18.449> four<00:00:18.750> pads<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.140> we've

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
out all these four pads that we've

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.490 
out all these four pads that we've
recorded<00:00:19.619> by<00:00:20.279> record<00:00:20.910> shift<00:00:21.240> shift<00:00:22.109> delete

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
recorded by record shift shift delete

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.259 
recorded by record shift shift delete
and<00:00:22.800> we'll<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.189> hold<00:00:23.400> them<00:00:23.550> all<00:00:23.699> down<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and we'll just hold them all down and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.689 
and we'll just hold them all down and
they'll<00:00:24.480> wipe<00:00:24.720> out<00:00:24.990> over<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.310> course<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
they'll wipe out over that the course of

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.259 
they'll wipe out over that the course of
that<00:00:26.760> measure

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that measure

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.410 
that measure
okay<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:27.960> let's<00:00:28.230> set<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.830> scale<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.269> be

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
okay so let's set up our scale to be

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.190 
okay so let's set up our scale to be
eighth<00:00:30.630> notes<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:32.059> we'll<00:00:33.059> record<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.630> really

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
eighth notes and we'll record a really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
eighth notes and we'll record a really
sloppy<00:00:34.469> kick<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.010> snare<00:00:35.250> okay<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.300> will

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
sloppy kick and snare okay this will

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.400 
sloppy kick and snare okay this will
show<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.719> how<00:00:36.960> forgiving<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.430> dr<00:00:38.730> 670<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
show you how forgiving the dr 670 is in

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
show you how forgiving the dr 670 is in
terms<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> cleaning<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.879> time<00:00:42.120> or

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
terms of it cleaning up your time or

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
terms of it cleaning up your time or
quantizing<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:48.860> see<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.039> timing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
quantizing here we go see my timing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100 
quantizing here we go see my timing
originally<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.149> really<00:00:51.629> bad<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
originally was really bad but that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
originally was really bad but that
cleaned<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.280> nearest<00:00:53.670> eighth

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
cleaned it up to the nearest eighth

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.439 
cleaned it up to the nearest eighth
notes<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:55.530> let's<00:00:56.070> delete<00:00:56.730> these<00:00:56.940> parts<00:00:57.329> again

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
notes now let's delete these parts again

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.990 
notes now let's delete these parts again
shifts<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.260> delete<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.949> pull<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.640> here

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
shifts and delete and pull them out here

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
shifts and delete and pull them out here
and<00:01:00.180> let's<00:01:00.870> try<00:01:01.109> another<00:01:01.410> kick<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> snare

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and let's try another kick and snare

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
and let's try another kick and snare
that's<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.760> busy<00:01:03.170> here<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:09.710> did

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that's a little bit busy here we go did

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.050 
that's a little bit busy here we go did
you<00:01:10.740> hear<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.130> some<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.369> those<00:01:11.549> parts<00:01:11.939> are

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you hear how some of those parts are

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
you hear how some of those parts are
recorded<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.810> slammed<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> nearest

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
recorded just slammed to the nearest

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
recorded just slammed to the nearest
eighth<00:01:14.850> notes<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.530> what

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
eighth notes but that's really not what

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240 
eighth notes but that's really not what
I<00:01:16.770> wanted<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:18.170> kick<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.320> snare<00:01:19.680> pattern<00:01:19.950> like

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I wanted a kick and snare pattern like

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.289 
I wanted a kick and snare pattern like
this<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.759> goes<00:01:22.280> actually<00:01:23.280> holds<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.970> much

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this that goes actually holds a much

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.719 
this that goes actually holds a much
finer<00:01:24.689> resolution<00:01:24.990> than<00:01:25.890> eighth<00:01:26.189> notes<00:01:26.580> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
finer resolution than eighth notes a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.160 
finer resolution than eighth notes a
space<00:01:27.030> between<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> kick<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> snare

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
space between the kick and the snare

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.850 
space between the kick and the snare
here<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:33.470> that's<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
here when I go that's actually a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
here when I go that's actually a
sixteenth<00:01:35.400> note<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.939> between<00:01:36.600> those<00:01:36.780> parts

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
sixteenth note in between those parts

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.960 
sixteenth note in between those parts
there<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.470> there's<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
there so there's no way that I can

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
there so there's no way that I can
record<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> part<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:42.079> that's<00:01:43.079> never

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
record a part like this that's never

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.810 
record a part like this that's never
going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.740> recorded<00:01:44.159> faithfully<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
going to be recorded faithfully in a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.969 
going to be recorded faithfully in a
pattern<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.600> quantizing<00:01:46.320> resolution

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
pattern where the quantizing resolution

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.030 
pattern where the quantizing resolution
is<00:01:47.130> set<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.509> eighth<00:01:48.780> notes<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.680> ain't<00:01:49.920> going

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
is set to eighth notes just ain't going

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.999 
is set to eighth notes just ain't going
to<00:01:50.130> happen<00:01:50.869> do<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.530> correlation

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to happen do you now see the correlation

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.510 
to happen do you now see the correlation
between<00:01:54.409> quantizing<00:01:55.409> resolution<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> how

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
between quantizing resolution and how

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.020 
between quantizing resolution and how
busy<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.600> part<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.079> were<00:01:58.259> recording<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.159> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
busy the part you were recording is you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.800 
busy the part you were recording is you
cannot<00:02:00.540> capture<00:02:00.930> anything<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.219> finer

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
cannot capture anything that is finer

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
cannot capture anything that is finer
than<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> current<00:02:04.500> quantized<00:02:05.280> resolution<00:02:06.000> or

than the current quantized resolution or

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.059 
than the current quantized resolution or
a<00:02:06.210> scale<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> set<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.259> eighth<00:02:07.530> notes<00:02:07.950> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
a scale if it's set to eighth notes and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
a scale if it's set to eighth notes and
you<00:02:08.250> drop<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.580> some<00:02:08.759> high<00:02:08.910> hats<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.270> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you drop in some high hats like this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.590 
you drop in some high hats like this
for<00:02:11.250> example<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.970> want<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.240> come<00:02:12.420> out

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
for example they just want to come out

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.020 
for example they just want to come out
right<00:02:12.840> they'll<00:02:13.140> all<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:13.680> smashed<00:02:14.280> two
