00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 Y 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.990
 hello today we present the day live kit 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.080
 by 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.900
 and the support 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.000
 we'll see that this kit mimics the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:40.830
 perfection what is a pipe 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.830
 first of all me with the instructions 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.270
 with the case the presentation is very 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.540
 good and we see that it comes in the 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.820
 pipe the charger comes a game of 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.420
 two batteries and the three of us come 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.879
 load cartridges that we will put in your 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 inside good before showing what 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.280
 is the contents of the box we are going to 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 show the support that goes apart from 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.909
 banner that must be purchased separately by 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.180
 one part goes the pipe otherwise it goes 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.510
 to the stand where is an invitation to 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.190
 wood 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.560
 and it will serve us to comfortably support it 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's leave it for the moment here next 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.610
 and good 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.110
 Well let's go to see everything 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.110
 contains the box on the one hand we have 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 the pipe 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.030
 that we will let support in its supports the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.410
 boss bought with another part we have the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.410
 batteries that well these 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.160
 here we have the charger 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.260
 by a cable and to charge the two 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.440
 batteries to the crack as we can 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.440
 observe 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.960
 and finally we have 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.310
 three cartridges to fill with liquids 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.319
 and looking inside the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.319
 now we will go to the cutting 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.300
 now we will load the load of 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.300
 batteries batteries have a part 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.740
 negative and another positive we will see that the 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.080
 negative in the flat part in the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.630
 positive has a little more headline as 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.459
 all batteries and batteries good in the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.160
 charger we will observe that it takes two 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.890
 little lights 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.380
 to be the batteries the negative part 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.820
 is the bottom and the positive side the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.370
 superior in nine sort of dock for 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.500
 adapt to this battery model that 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.020
 can serve you for other models that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.820
 the battery is longer go in this case 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.430
 we will take the part as we said 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.800
 negative in the negative bottom and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.360
 we put it in this case we already have 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.180
 charged the batteries with which it 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.980
 keeps light in green light we can 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.530
 observe that it is still green because the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 battery already has charges if you do not 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.830
 they would be red and when they will go to 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.440
 this green status means that they are already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.270
 fully loaded with a good cap 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.240
 now here we make the batteries 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:15.450
 loaded we will put them on the track 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.330
 the pipe for disassembly very simple 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.930
 the top part we have this piece that 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.930
 goes to threaded 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.700
 trying to tighten it a lot will cost us 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.100
 where we will introduce what is the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 battery the flat part that is the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.880
 negative on the dock the part let's say 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.050
 down and we put it here and now 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.050
 and we press screw mos 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.260
 does a little network 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.430
 resistance but normal we look for 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.340
 until it is adjusted to tighten a lot 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480
 later it will cost you more here, good let's leave 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.820
 a battery part of the one that is already 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.780
 loaded and we're going to see how the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.510
 part of the atomizer and what is the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.490
 load in this piece we just throw 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.230
 straight is worth here is once when 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.510
 we open a plastic and I already have 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.520
 removed trim from removing it with 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.310
 Transparent plastic protection if 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.690
 not well it will bother for the paper well the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.910
 part of the mouthpiece is so simple 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.830
 like this and we have the part of 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.870
 atomized and atomized and we want it 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.250
 take out to clean it for whatever it was 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.970
 for threading 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.990
 and once we see that it already comes out 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.810
 directly we throw and we'll see that the 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.120
 piece 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.230
 It is simply a thread atomizer 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.330
 type 510 and in this part we will now 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.610
 the charge cartridge we go back to 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.620
 enter it until the end compression and 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.620
 when we see that you already plot me we screw 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.529
 well now let's move on to the 

00:04:54.109 --> 00:05:00.759
 cartridges do not have three you'll catch with 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.759
 they are presented 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.490
 with the cartridge I would like to keep it 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.490
 that has a more pointed part 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.330
 and another part that is flatter rather the 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:18.199
 filling comes to be for the most part 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.889
 pointy I recommend a bottle 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.419
 the typical bottle with the needle for 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.719
 the filling since the hole in 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.459
 some liquids because it is very large what 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.110
 which is the mouth and then it would not enter 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:34.009
 ok then we just introduce 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.580
 well the bottle and we fill 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.580
 until 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.309
 once filled 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:46.039
 we will simply introduce the part 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.330
 where we have filled in that is very 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.240
 important in the part where we have 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.729
 stuffed we put it inside the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.580
 pipe in this way and we press hard 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.289
 until the end once this is done 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.240
 we will simply put 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:06.270
 is the mouthpiece that bears a position 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:08.210
 also and we would have the pipe ready 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.630
 to map 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.630
 In return 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.359
 now we will move on to the batting test 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:20.639
 I want to remember them in this model that 

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:23.699
 there is a plastic that comes from origin and 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.529
 which is located exactly here that is 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.439
 the air intake if you do not remove the 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.739
 plastic is actually drowning if you put the 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.659
 finger in this piece here drowns like 

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.399
 you have to catch her she 's like the cousin 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:39.479
 normally that is to say it has the form 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:41.470
 even so but not all do not put like this 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.990
 because then 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.600
 we can not alter vale let's do the 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.040
 test but and just like everything 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.040
 will fight the long 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.240
 and we see that it has a great matte 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.789
 Another detail that the pipe has is that it 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.000
 illuminates a light here that we can 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.000
 observe 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.530
 giving the impression even that it is 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.400
 burning the tobacco look to another 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.400
 video and other foot 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 yes
