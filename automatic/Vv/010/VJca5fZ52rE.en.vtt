the<00:01:39.689> biggest<00:01:40.079> reason<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the biggest reason that we do this is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
the biggest reason that we do this is
that<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.939> money<00:01:42.210> saving<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:44.040> that
