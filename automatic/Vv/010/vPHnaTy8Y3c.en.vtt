think<00:04:57.780> we've<00:04:57.870> had<00:04:57.960> anything<00:04:58.169> did<00:04:58.350> me

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:24.029 

so<00:05:10.060> two<00:05:10.270> sets<00:05:10.300> boys<00:05:10.810> then<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.290> Ravi<00:05:11.830> were<00:05:11.980> they

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.100 

yes<00:05:25.039> I<00:05:25.430> think<00:05:25.939> the<00:05:26.210> house<00:05:26.389> should<00:05:26.419> have<00:05:26.659> some

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
yes I think the house should have some

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.200 
yes I think the house should have some
bigger<00:05:27.710> ones<00:05:27.800> in<00:05:28.099> it<00:05:28.220> yeah<00:05:28.490> well<00:05:28.849> I<00:05:28.909> figure

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
bigger ones in it yeah well I figure

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:42.010 
bigger ones in it yeah well I figure
then<00:05:29.360> yesterday<00:05:30.639> and<00:05:31.639> then<00:05:31.909> now<00:05:32.060> when<00:05:32.240> two<00:05:32.419> is

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
so that'd be like a one or two year old

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.310 
so that'd be like a one or two year old
they're<00:05:45.270> just<00:05:45.420> kids
