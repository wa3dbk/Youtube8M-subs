didn't<00:01:47.720> have<00:01:47.870> a<00:01:47.930> way<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.230> recording<00:01:49.150> so

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
didn't have a way of recording so

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.330 
didn't have a way of recording so
eventually<00:01:50.540> i<00:01:50.780> gave<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.530> accorded<00:01:52.280> with

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
eventually i gave in and accorded with

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.760 
eventually i gave in and accorded with
my<00:01:52.580> brother<00:01:52.790> die<00:01:53.000> pad<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:54.290> my<00:01:54.410> first

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
my brother die pad be like my first

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.620 
my brother die pad be like my first
videos<00:01:55.100> you'll<00:01:55.370> see<00:01:55.610> i<00:01:55.640> was<00:01:55.910> actually<00:01:56.150> video

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
videos you'll see i was actually video

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.290 
videos you'll see i was actually video
taping<00:01:57.020> my<00:01:57.050> phone<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:58.490> was<00:01:58.580> very<00:01:58.610> difficult

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
taping my phone that was very difficult

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.260 
taping my phone that was very difficult
and<00:01:59.800> i<00:02:00.800> eventually<00:02:00.890> got<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.550> jailbreak<00:02:02.120> for

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and i eventually got the jailbreak for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.850 
and i eventually got the jailbreak for
my<00:02:02.390> phone<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:02.990> could<00:02:03.110> actually<00:02:03.350> record<00:02:03.800> the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
my phone so I could actually record the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.250 
my phone so I could actually record the
screen<00:02:04.270> alright<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.510> next<00:02:05.540> question<00:02:05.780> is

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
screen alright so the next question is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.919 
screen alright so the next question is
by<00:02:06.410> bolt<00:02:06.680> ons<00:02:06.860> 23<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.670> he<00:02:07.700> s<00:02:07.940> what<00:02:08.810> do<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
by bolt ons 23 and he s what do you

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.010 
by bolt ons 23 and he s what do you
think<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.290> most<00:02:09.320> important<00:02:09.950> defense<00:02:10.280> I

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
think is the most important defense I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.360 
think is the most important defense I
think<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.200> every<00:02:12.560> defense<00:02:12.950> has<00:02:13.220> their<00:02:13.340> own

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
think that every defense has their own

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.400 
think that every defense has their own
unique<00:02:13.459> purpose<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.360> without<00:02:14.690> each<00:02:14.959> one<00:02:15.200> your

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
unique purpose and without each one your

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.720 
unique purpose and without each one your
base<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.950> weakness<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.520> certain

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
base will have a weakness in a certain

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.150 
base will have a weakness in a certain
way<00:02:17.440> alright<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.590> I'm<00:02:18.650> going<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.860> answer<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
way alright so I'm going to answer the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.530 
way alright so I'm going to answer the
last<00:02:19.310> beer<00:02:19.580> question<00:02:20.000> at<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> end<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
last beer question at the end of the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.810 
last beer question at the end of the
video<00:02:20.630> but<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.530> wanted<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.920> take<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.220> break<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.790> I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
video but I wanted to take a break so I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.340 
video but I wanted to take a break so I
could<00:02:23.060> show<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.240> guys<00:02:23.420> how<00:02:23.480> my<00:02:23.720> defenses<00:02:24.230> were

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
could show you guys how my defenses were

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.590 
could show you guys how my defenses were
going<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.880> I'm<00:02:25.880> starting<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.209> lose<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.420> little

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
going and I'm starting to lose a little

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.570 
going and I'm starting to lose a little
bit<00:02:26.720> more<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.470> defenses<00:02:28.040> are<00:02:28.190> definitely

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
bit more so the defenses are definitely

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.790 
bit more so the defenses are definitely
getting<00:02:28.640> tougher<00:02:29.090> let's<00:02:29.989> move<00:02:30.320> on<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.590> some

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
getting tougher let's move on to some

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.430 
getting tougher let's move on to some
attacks<00:02:31.330> okay<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.390> you<00:02:32.630> can<00:02:32.810> tell<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.320> this

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
attacks okay so you can tell that this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.770 
attacks okay so you can tell that this
guy<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.680> partially<00:02:34.430> inactive<00:02:34.910> he<00:02:35.450> has<00:02:35.600> been

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
guy is partially inactive he has been

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.300 
guy is partially inactive he has been
playing<00:02:36.019> though<00:02:36.260> because<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:37.010> see<00:02:37.280> that

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
playing though because you can see that

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.970 
playing though because you can see that
he<00:02:38.269> has<00:02:38.300> some<00:02:38.750> resources<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> storages

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
he has some resources in the storages

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.970 
he has some resources in the storages
but<00:02:41.019> 240,000<00:02:42.019> is<00:02:42.140> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.380> be<00:02:42.440> inside<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
but 240,000 is going to be inside the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.590 
but 240,000 is going to be inside the
collectors<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.090> I'm<00:02:44.300> going<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.450> take

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
collectors so I'm going to take

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.470 
collectors so I'm going to take
advantage<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.560> attack<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.160> guy

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
advantage of that and attack this guy

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.240 
advantage of that and attack this guy
since<00:02:47.480> using<00:02:47.720> active<00:02:48.200> he's<00:02:48.470> most<00:02:48.769> likely<00:02:48.830> not

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
since using active he's most likely not

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.530 
since using active he's most likely not
going<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.489> have<00:02:49.580> troops<00:02:49.820> inside<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.330> clan

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
going to have troops inside the clan

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.810 
going to have troops inside the clan
castle<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.650> all<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> gotta<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.459> is<00:02:52.489> just

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
castle so all I gotta do is just

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.640 
castle so all I gotta do is just
distract<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.390> heroes<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.019> we<00:02:54.350> should<00:02:54.530> be

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
distract the heroes and we should be

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.410 
distract the heroes and we should be
good<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.800> go<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.760> only<00:02:55.970> thing<00:02:56.120> about<00:02:56.269> this

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
good to go the only thing about this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.690 
good to go the only thing about this
base<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.320> guy's<00:02:57.560> mortars<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.370> wizard

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
base is this guy's mortars and wizard

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.160 
base is this guy's mortars and wizard
towers<00:02:59.000> are<00:02:59.150> pretty<00:02:59.360> close<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.750> outside

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
towers are pretty close to the outside

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.590 
towers are pretty close to the outside
so<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.430> only<00:03:01.519> reason<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:01.970> did<00:03:02.239> decide<00:03:02.540> to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
so the only reason I did decide to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.270 
so the only reason I did decide to
attack<00:03:02.989> this<00:03:03.170> one<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.590> because<00:03:03.980> they're

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
attack this one is because they're

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.490 
attack this one is because they're
pretty<00:03:04.550> weak<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.690> there's<00:03:05.870> not<00:03:05.989> much<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.320> worry

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
pretty weak so there's not much to worry

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
pretty weak so there's not much to worry
about<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.830> attack<00:03:07.160> we're<00:03:08.150> pretty<00:03:08.330> much<00:03:08.480> at

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
about this attack we're pretty much at

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.080 
about this attack we're pretty much at
fifty<00:03:08.989> percent<00:03:09.320> now<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.400> I'm<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:10.910> going<00:03:11.030> to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
fifty percent now so I'm just going to

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.000 
fifty percent now so I'm just going to
deploy<00:03:11.300> my<00:03:11.480> clan<00:03:11.690> castle<00:03:11.930> troops<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.590> take<00:03:12.860> out

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
deploy my clan castle troops to take out

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.920 
deploy my clan castle troops to take out
this<00:03:13.100> Archer<00:03:13.459> tower<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.420> we're<00:03:14.600> at<00:03:14.690> fifty

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
this Archer tower and we're at fifty

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.220 
this Archer tower and we're at fifty
percent<00:03:15.230> plus<00:03:15.980> four<00:03:16.310> trophies<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.050> lower

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
percent plus four trophies that is lower

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.630 
percent plus four trophies that is lower
than<00:03:18.440> normal<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:18.920> every<00:03:19.220> once<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.519> while

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
than normal but every once in a while

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.720 
than normal but every once in a while
I'll<00:03:19.850> substitute<00:03:20.450> trophies<00:03:21.080> for<00:03:21.260> resources

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
I'll substitute trophies for resources

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.410 
I'll substitute trophies for resources
of<00:03:22.730> course<00:03:22.970> as<00:03:23.120> long<00:03:23.150> as<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.540> still<00:03:23.810> go<00:03:23.900> positive

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
of course as long as I still go positive

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.030 
of course as long as I still go positive
alright<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.660> we<00:03:26.840> got<00:03:26.870> some<00:03:27.200> more<00:03:27.349> week<00:03:27.590> mortars

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
alright so we got some more week mortars

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.650 
alright so we got some more week mortars
and<00:03:28.190> wizard<00:03:28.459> towers<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.060> they're<00:03:29.330> all<00:03:29.510> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
and wizard towers and they're all so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.199 
and wizard towers and they're all so
close<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> center<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.580> don't<00:03:32.000> really

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
close to the center so we don't really

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.360 
close to the center so we don't really
have<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.510> worry<00:03:32.540> about<00:03:32.780> them<00:03:33.050> at<00:03:33.200> all<00:03:33.370> right

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
have to worry about them at all right

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.949 
have to worry about them at all right
now<00:03:34.520> I'm<00:03:34.670> learning<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:34.970> heroes<00:03:35.480> over<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
now I'm learning the heroes over to the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.449 
now I'm learning the heroes over to the
bottom<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.500> taking<00:03:37.040> out<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.220> clan<00:03:37.430> castle

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
bottom and taking out the clan castle

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.210 
bottom and taking out the clan castle
troops<00:03:37.819> with<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> light<00:03:38.860> I've<00:03:39.860> been<00:03:40.040> using

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
troops with the light I've been using

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.800 
troops with the light I've been using
this<00:03:40.400> new<00:03:40.640> technique<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.270> take<00:03:41.540> out<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
this new technique to take out the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.960 
this new technique to take out the
heroes<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.800> requires<00:03:43.160> wizards<00:03:43.700> in<00:03:43.819> your

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
heroes and it requires wizards in your

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.199 
heroes and it requires wizards in your
clan<00:03:44.150> castle<00:03:44.739> but<00:03:45.760> basically<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.940> draw<00:03:47.150> the

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
clan castle but basically you draw the

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.630 
clan castle but basically you draw the
Curos<00:03:47.540> over<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:47.959> side<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.980> drop<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> clan

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
Curos over to one side and drop the clan

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.120 
Curos over to one side and drop the clan
castle<00:03:49.670> troops<00:03:50.000> on<00:03:50.360> them<00:03:50.680> maybe<00:03:51.680> using<00:03:51.920> a

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
castle troops on them maybe using a

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.920 
castle troops on them maybe using a
couple<00:03:52.400> barbarians<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.090> take<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> hits<00:03:53.690> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
couple barbarians to take the hits and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.509 
couple barbarians to take the hits and
protect<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.380> Wizards<00:03:54.739> while<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.130> take<00:03:55.400> out

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
protect the Wizards while they take out

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.270 
protect the Wizards while they take out
the<00:03:55.640> heroes<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:57.380> Wizards<00:03:57.680> actually<00:03:57.980> take<00:03:58.130> out

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
the heroes the Wizards actually take out

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.100 
the heroes the Wizards actually take out
the<00:03:58.430> heroes<00:03:58.730> pretty<00:03:59.060> quickly<00:03:59.360> regardless<00:03:59.959> of

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the heroes pretty quickly regardless of

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.170 
the heroes pretty quickly regardless of
the<00:04:00.200> level<00:04:00.400> then<00:04:01.400> you'll<00:04:01.519> have<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.760> deploy<00:04:02.000> as

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the level then you'll have to deploy as

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.750 
the level then you'll have to deploy as
many<00:04:02.390> troops<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.080> side<00:04:03.290> because<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
many troops on this side because the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.220 
many troops on this side because the
Wizards<00:04:05.180> actually<00:04:05.510> do<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.600> pretty<00:04:05.780> good<00:04:05.870> job<00:04:05.989> at

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
Wizards actually do a pretty good job at

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.680 
Wizards actually do a pretty good job at
taking<00:04:06.560> out<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.890> buildings<00:04:07.220> as<00:04:07.340> well<00:04:07.690> one

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
taking out the buildings as well one

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.570 
taking out the buildings as well one
thing<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:08.900> forgot<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.170> mention<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:10.160> upgraded

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
thing I forgot to mention is I upgraded

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.009 
thing I forgot to mention is I upgraded
my<00:04:10.670> Archer<00:04:11.000> Queen<00:04:11.180> at<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.510> beginning<00:04:11.870> of<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
my Archer Queen at the beginning of the

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.949 
my Archer Queen at the beginning of the
trophy<00:04:12.380> run<00:04:12.560> kind<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.700> bad<00:04:13.910> idea<00:04:14.120> but<00:04:14.630> I

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
trophy run kind of a bad idea but I

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.440 
trophy run kind of a bad idea but I
really<00:04:15.350> hate<00:04:15.530> downtime<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.040> I<00:04:16.639> had<00:04:17.329> the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
really hate downtime so I had the

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.289 
really hate downtime so I had the
resources<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:18.650> had<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:18.919> get<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.100> done<00:04:19.310> but

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
resources and I had to get it done but

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.819 
resources and I had to get it done but
using<00:04:20.630> this<00:04:20.720> new<00:04:20.900> technique<00:04:21.290> it<00:04:21.560> actually

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
using this new technique it actually

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.830 
using this new technique it actually
allows<00:04:22.100> me<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.700> not<00:04:22.970> have<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> worry<00:04:23.479> about<00:04:23.600> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
allows me to not have to worry about the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.659 
allows me to not have to worry about the
heroes<00:04:24.139> at<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.470> end<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.740> match<00:04:24.889> so<00:04:25.610> it

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
heroes at the end of the match so it

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.190 
heroes at the end of the match so it
makes<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.000> getting<00:04:26.240> the<00:04:26.330> last<00:04:26.540> percentage<00:04:27.080> a

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
makes it getting the last percentage a

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.350 
makes it getting the last percentage a
little<00:04:27.440> bit<00:04:27.530> easier<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.100> also<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.210> very

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
little bit easier I also have to be very

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.600 
little bit easier I also have to be very
wise<00:04:29.600> when<00:04:29.900> choosing<00:04:30.110> attacks<00:04:30.560> because<00:04:31.460> i

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
wise when choosing attacks because i

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.130 
wise when choosing attacks because i
don't<00:04:31.850> have<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.210> archer<00:04:32.450> queen<00:04:32.630> for<00:04:32.780> bathroom

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
don't have the archer queen for bathroom

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.680 
don't have the archer queen for bathroom
ok<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:34.130> i'm<00:04:34.370> at<00:04:34.460> forty-nine<00:04:34.880> percent<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.600> i'm

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
ok so i'm at forty-nine percent and i'm

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.240 
ok so i'm at forty-nine percent and i'm
going<00:04:35.840> to<00:04:35.900> use<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> lightning<00:04:36.560> over<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.039> to
