standing in front of one of them right

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.580 
standing in front of one of them right
now<00:00:44.450> looks<00:00:45.450> like<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.720> crossing<00:00:46.170> hasn't<00:00:46.500> been

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
now looks like this crossing hasn't been

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.630 
now looks like this crossing hasn't been
used<00:00:46.830> in<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.130> maybe<00:00:47.520> 20<00:00:48.270> 25<00:00:48.750> years<00:00:49.640> crossing

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
used in about maybe 20 25 years crossing

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
used in about maybe 20 25 years crossing
gates<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.600> old<00:00:51.900> they<00:00:52.770> probably<00:00:53.129> don't

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
gates are very old they probably don't

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
gates are very old they probably don't
even<00:00:53.520> work<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.120> surprised<00:00:54.480> CXS<00:00:55.019> leaves<00:00:55.320> them

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
even work I'm surprised CXS leaves them

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.250 
even work I'm surprised CXS leaves them
up<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.640> we'll<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.150> tour<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.989> I'll<00:00:58.050> show

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
Wow you can tell how long it's been

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.180 
Wow you can tell how long it's been
since<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.130> train<00:01:51.430> has<00:01:51.700> come<00:01:51.970> through<00:01:52.210> here

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
since the train has come through here

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.469 
since the train has come through here
just<00:01:54.190> by<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.369> growth<00:01:54.700> on<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.970> tracks<00:01:55.240> and

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
just by the growth on the tracks and

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.910 
just by the growth on the tracks and
look<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.840> tree<00:01:56.170> right<00:01:56.380> here<00:01:56.440> growing

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
look at this tree right here growing

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:44.250 
look at this tree right here growing
right<00:01:57.159> outside<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.820> rail

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.360 

you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:09.910 

you

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.680 

we<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> second<00:03:11.550> railroad<00:03:11.910> crossing<00:03:12.450> here

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
we are the second railroad crossing here

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.479 
we are the second railroad crossing here
that<00:03:12.900> has<00:03:13.019> not<00:03:13.200> been<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.530> use<00:03:13.709> for<00:03:13.739> quite<00:03:14.220> some

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
that has not been in use for quite some

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.699 
that has not been in use for quite some
time<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:15.450> only<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.810> half<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.200> mile<00:03:16.379> from<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
time it's only a half a mile from the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.420 
time it's only a half a mile from the
other<00:03:16.830> place<00:03:17.069> where<00:03:17.340> I've<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.430> been<00:03:18.650> as<00:03:19.650> it

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
other place where I've just been as it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.970 
other place where I've just been as it
looks<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.819> that's<00:03:21.000> maybe<00:03:21.510> 20<00:03:21.930> 25<00:03:22.440> years<00:03:22.680> since

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
looks so that's maybe 20 25 years since

00:03:22.980 --> 00:04:07.539 
looks so that's maybe 20 25 years since
they've<00:03:23.250> operated<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.120> crossing

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.250 

like<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.150> see<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.329> train<00:04:08.629> come<00:04:08.870> through<00:04:09.110> that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
like to see a train come through that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.310 
like to see a train come through that
right<00:04:09.500> now

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.230 

yet<00:04:17.320> school<00:04:17.770> buses<00:04:18.280> still<00:04:18.610> stop<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.090> this

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
yet school buses still stop at this

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.720 
yet school buses still stop at this

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
crossing which makes no sense or cxs

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.180 
crossing which makes no sense or cxs
