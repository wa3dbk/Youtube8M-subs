00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.610
 Yes Hello is also from the street Big Japan representative of Morita 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.970
 Today Thank you for seeing the athlete project Morita Kayojuku 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.359
 ToDay 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:31.110
 It is the latest version of the training using this peanut paddle 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:36.060
 This is what I will introduce 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.410
 I realized this when I was practicing but 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:48.090
 At the time of the water below in Kroll 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.230
 It is easier to catch if the little finger is attached than it is released 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.830
 So I was 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 It all means at the will come out soon effect when training using p spar earth everyone 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.250
 Went to please 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.540
 As our additional was 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 like this 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.670
 I will put on and when I usually do this middle finger 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.220
 Put on 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.150
 I will swim but this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.150
 With the little finger 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.040
 9 3 wii 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.110
 Ny 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.110
 Such a form in it is such a form 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.420
 The head is also the same as Peanut paddle that I always do as it is 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.870
 To go 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 By doing that part 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.409
 First, with the image that the part here is firmly attached 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.320
 9 at the little finger 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.350
 Most important 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:59.480
 I catch such a part of the place where it is easy to make an elbow in the place where this kind of person x åŠ‰ is angry 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.670
 I can write, so when I took it 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.189
 this 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:10.720
 The water shines so much towards the small finger ring finger so much water 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:17.050
 It will be easier to grasp, so I always say this at Finesse Far 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.410
 Look for a long distance or go at a pace as fast as possible, not for slow practice 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.230
 If you want to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.130
 I think it's better to use a pin or suck if you can't use fins with deaf as much as possible 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.330
 Reduce the distance 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:37.210
 That's right 80% to 90% pace 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.170
 Or I want to improve the catch of this water and such feeling in the form of speeding up more 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:45.310
 The person is really 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.150
 Practice the dash and then put in the 4 practice for the effect of the paddle 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.180
 Because it comes out, by all means this 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.700
 As a training using the little finger 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:00.610
 Please try using this p- Narsuwal 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:07.090
 Peanuts in it is the person of mine Tteyuu this training issue grayed What about Padu 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:12.910
 For example, the master will teach you a delivery using a cat image 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.690
 Although the I have a lot of Tteyuu a tool to advance bounce of Tteyuu this tool this 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.630
 Tools that do not advance 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:26.780
 In my own way to go forward and the movement of my feet 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:30.170
 Us properly to this aid in I mean is better to kick in with the feeling the same about 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.680
 And well this lesson or something in the lesson 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:39.090
 I can practice the sense of being assisted by 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:44.400
 Looks all means we will become very important for Tteyuu go as 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.840
