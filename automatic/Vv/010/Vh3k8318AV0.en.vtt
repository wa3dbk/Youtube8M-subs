the<00:00:18.990> description<00:00:19.520> box<00:00:21.109> alright<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.320> start

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the description box alright so to start

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
the description box alright so to start
you<00:00:22.769> got<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:23.160> off<00:00:23.340> these<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:24.150> x<00:00:24.390> types

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you got to take off these two x types

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.269 
you got to take off these two x types
and<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.439> by<00:00:25.500> getting<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.010> flat<00:00:26.250> head

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and you do that by getting a flat head

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.859 
and you do that by getting a flat head
screwdriver<00:00:27.080> then<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.619> push<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.869> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
screwdriver then you just go push in and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.840 
screwdriver then you just go push in and
so<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.560> makes<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> little<00:00:32.250> popping<00:00:32.610> noise

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
so it makes like a little popping noise

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.740 
so it makes like a little popping noise
really<00:00:33.180> hard<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> hear<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:35.630> eventually<00:00:36.630> it'll

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
really hard to hear and eventually it'll

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530 
really hard to hear and eventually it'll
release<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.090> you've<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> keep<00:00:39.480> working

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
release it so you've got to keep working

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.000 
release it so you've got to keep working
it<00:00:41.809> sometimes<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.700> lot<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.730> pressure

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
it sometimes we got a lot of pressure

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
it sometimes we got a lot of pressure
just<00:00:47.010> keep<00:00:47.250> working<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.000> could<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just keep working around and I could it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.369 
just keep working around and I could it
kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> circle<00:00:50.629> no<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.870> see

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
kind of like a circle no it's not see

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.549 
kind of like a circle no it's not see
that<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:53.160> popped<00:00:53.370> off<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:55.530> goes

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that I just popped off the way it goes

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.420 
that I just popped off the way it goes
out<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.600> goes<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.910> one<00:00:59.910> stuff<00:01:01.430> pretty

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.500 
going to flip it over don't throw these
X<00:01:19.860> camps<00:01:20.220> away<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:20.580> we're<00:01:20.790> still<00:01:21.390> going
