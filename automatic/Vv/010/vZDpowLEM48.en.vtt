00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
shoot without really moving II Yanis

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
shoot without really moving II Yanis
piston<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> hear<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> button<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
piston so when you hear this button the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
piston so when you hear this button the
red<00:00:51.449> stone<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.960> push<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.500> piston<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
red stone will push the piston up and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.540 
red stone will push the piston up and
the<00:00:54.030> spawner<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:54.930> obviously<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the spawner as well obviously and that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
the spawner as well obviously and that
will<00:00:56.640> let<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.850> allow<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> go<00:00:57.930> off<00:01:00.680> but

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
will let it allow it to go off but

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
will let it allow it to go off but
that's<00:01:01.829> nothing<00:01:01.949> new<00:01:02.329> well<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.539> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> new

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that's nothing new well it's kind of new

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.920 
that's nothing new well it's kind of new
but<00:01:04.049> it's<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> interesting<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:06.659> here

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
but it's time the interesting thing here

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.420 
but it's time the interesting thing here
is<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.170> spawn<00:01:10.680> tile

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
is that you can actually spawn tile

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.670 
is that you can actually spawn tile
entities<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.689> Thailand<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> use<00:01:13.350> things<00:01:13.590> like

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
entities so Thailand to use things like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
entities so Thailand to use things like
chests<00:01:14.220> furnaces<00:01:14.729> study<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.119> those<00:01:15.270> blocks

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
chests furnaces study know those blocks

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
chests furnaces study know those blocks
of<00:01:15.990> car<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.200> push<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.530> pistons<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:18.540> can

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of car we push with pistons you can

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
of car we push with pistons you can
actually<00:01:18.780> spawn<00:01:19.140> them<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.530> data<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.700> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
actually spawn them with data in them so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
actually spawn them with data in them so
they<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.659> counts<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.229> mob<00:01:22.350> sports<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.799> can

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
they also counts for mob sports you can

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.609 
they also counts for mob sports you can
spawn<00:01:23.630> mob<00:01:24.630> spawners<00:01:24.930> that's<00:01:25.290> bought<00:01:25.500> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
spawn mob spawners that's bought in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.320 
spawn mob spawners that's bought in
other<00:01:25.740> words<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.130> year<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.820> complicated

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
other words all year it's complicated

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.880 
other words all year it's complicated
and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.259> actually<00:01:29.250> did<00:01:29.490> try<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.150> them

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
and I actually did try this with them

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.060 
and I actually did try this with them
juke<00:01:31.890> boxes<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.619> don't<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.710> know<00:01:34.890> what

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
juke boxes but I don't really know what

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
juke boxes but I don't really know what
I'm<00:01:35.100> doing<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.659> game<00:01:36.840> crashed<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
I'm doing so the game crashed so I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530 
I'm doing so the game crashed so I
couldn't<00:01:37.799> include<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.030> idea<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
couldn't include that so the idea that I

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
couldn't include that so the idea that I
had<00:01:39.570> There<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:41.220> would<00:01:41.430> um<00:01:44.210> sort<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
had There was that you would um sort of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.670 
had There was that you would um sort of
do<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> similar<00:01:45.630> thing<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.530> would

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
do a similar thing here but it would

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.899 
do a similar thing here but it would
sort<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> trigger<00:01:47.189> am<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:48.770> music<00:01:49.770> disc<00:01:50.070> which

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sort of trigger am a music disc which

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.190 
sort of trigger am a music disc which
would<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.450> cool<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.750> an<00:01:51.869> adventure

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
would be kind of cool in an adventure
