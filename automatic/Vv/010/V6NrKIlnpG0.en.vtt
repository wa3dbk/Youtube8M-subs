game now so for whatever weird reason I

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.700 
game now so for whatever weird reason I
beat<00:00:22.849> this<00:00:23.029> level<00:00:23.210> already<00:00:23.509> but<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:24.470> it's

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
beat this level already but now it's

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.620 
beat this level already but now it's
telling<00:00:24.919> me<00:00:25.099> that<00:00:25.400> I<00:00:25.429> didn't<00:00:26.240> beat<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.539> or

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
telling me that I didn't beat it or

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.939 
telling me that I didn't beat it or
something<00:00:26.960> like<00:00:27.080> that<00:00:27.140> because<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.619> have<00:00:27.859> the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
something like that because I have the

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.519 
something like that because I have the
gym<00:00:28.189> for<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.429> level<00:00:28.660> but<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.990> can't<00:00:30.259> go<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:30.410> to

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
gym for the level but I can't go on to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.960 
gym for the level but I can't go on to
the<00:00:30.650> next<00:00:30.830> level<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:31.369> I<00:00:31.400> guess<00:00:31.699> that's<00:00:31.849> just

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
the next level so I guess that's just

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.760 
the next level so I guess that's just
some<00:00:32.240> weird<00:00:32.419> fuckery<00:00:32.900> with<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.260> game<00:00:33.410> saves

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
some weird fuckery with the game saves

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.280 
some weird fuckery with the game saves
or<00:00:33.980> something<00:00:34.220> like<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.390> we're<00:00:36.260> just

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
or something like that so we're just

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.720 
or something like that so we're just
going<00:00:36.500> to<00:00:36.560> be<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.829> level<00:00:37.070> here<00:00:37.250> again<00:00:37.520> and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
wondered that it's like yeah I realize

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.839 
wondered that it's like yeah I realize
it's<00:02:47.530> there<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.859> know<00:02:48.010> obviously<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.790> the

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
it's there you know obviously for the

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.490

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
player in all that shit but I think it'd

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.660 
player in all that shit but I think it'd
be<00:02:50.530> interesting<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:51.069> they<00:02:51.159> ever<00:02:51.220> made<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.459> game

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
be interesting if they ever made a game
