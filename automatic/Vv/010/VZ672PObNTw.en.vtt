jump spell went down as well and I have
avoided<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> giant<00:00:39.180> bombs<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.660> far<00:00:39.930> so

avoided all of the giant bombs so far so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.979

I'm<00:00:40.290> pretty<00:00:40.649> happy<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.670> long<00:00:41.910> as<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.300> mortar

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
I'm pretty happy and as long as a mortar

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I think I should be fine to get to the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
I think I should be fine to get to the
center<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> base<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.210> was

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
center of the base one thing that I was

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.060

looking<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.260> attacking<00:00:49.559> bases

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
looking for when I was attacking bases

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
looking for when I was attacking bases
was<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.640> sure<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.180> wasn't<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
was to make sure that there wasn't a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
was to make sure that there wasn't a
multi<00:00:52.260> targeted<00:00:52.680> Inferno<00:00:53.039> tower<00:00:53.250> from<00:00:53.550> the

multi targeted Inferno tower from the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
multi targeted Inferno tower from the
side<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.120> attacking<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.050> since<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
side I was attacking on so since this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.200 
side I was attacking on so since this
guy<00:00:55.920> had<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> single<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.579> front<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.940> really

and that might means my king should be

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670 
and that might means my king should be
able<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.180> finish<00:01:00.449> off<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.750> townhall<00:01:01.230> after<00:01:01.620> I

was<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.869> worried<00:01:07.140> about<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.409> the

two stars so far so letting my skeletons

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
two stars so far so letting my skeletons
do<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.799> bit<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.189> damage<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.790> well<00:01:32.939> as

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
do a little bit more damage as well as

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.390 
do a little bit more damage as well as
my<00:01:33.240> queen<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> left<00:01:34.020> hand<00:01:34.259> side<00:01:34.650> she's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
my queen on the left hand side she's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
my queen on the left hand side she's
gonna<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:35.729> ahead<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:35.970> shoot<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.329> wall<00:01:36.540> down

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
gonna go ahead and shoot this wall down

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
gonna go ahead and shoot this wall down
but<00:01:37.110> she's<00:01:37.350> gonna<00:01:37.500> move<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.860> little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.280> faster

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
but she's gonna move a little bit faster

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
but she's gonna move a little bit faster
than<00:01:39.210> everyone<00:01:39.509> else<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> second<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
than everyone else in a second and I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.289 
than everyone else in a second and I
think<00:01:41.159> she's<00:01:41.369> gonna<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.700> shot<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.060> by<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
think she's gonna get shot down by the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
think she's gonna get shot down by the

castle is gonna protect all of those

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.970 
castle is gonna protect all of those
skeletons<00:02:26.930> running<00:02:27.470> throughout<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.800> base

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
skeletons running throughout the base

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220 
skeletons running throughout the base
and<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.640> looks<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.030> massacre<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.990> very

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and it looks like a massacre in the very

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.320 
and it looks like a massacre in the very
center<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.130> unfortunately<00:02:31.820> most<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.210> my

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
center so unfortunately most of my

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.970 
center so unfortunately most of my
witches<00:02:32.720> went<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> right-hand<00:02:33.710> side

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
witches went to the right-hand side

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.400 
witches went to the right-hand side
which<00:02:34.220> means<00:02:34.430> only<00:02:34.700> my<00:02:35.030> queen<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.840> maybe<00:02:36.140> one

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
which means only my queen and maybe one

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.170 
which means only my queen and maybe one
or<00:02:36.530> two<00:02:36.560> witches<00:02:37.010> are<00:02:37.490> gonna<00:02:37.700> be<00:02:37.790> left<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.150> fend

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
or two witches are gonna be left to fend

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.700 
or two witches are gonna be left to fend
for<00:02:38.450> themselves<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.140> center<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:39.620> I'm

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
for themselves in the center so I'm

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.230 
for themselves in the center so I'm
gonna<00:02:39.830> try<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.040> keep<00:02:40.280> my<00:02:40.400> witch<00:02:40.640> or<00:02:40.850> my<00:02:41.000> queen

alive as long as possible
but<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.190> looks<00:02:43.400> like<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:44.030> those<00:02:44.180> witches

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
but it looks like all of those witches

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.600 
but it looks like all of those witches
as<00:02:44.780> well<00:02:45.110> as<00:02:45.230> my<00:02:45.410> king<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> Golem<00:02:46.400> are

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
points left the skeletons are actually

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.380 
points left the skeletons are actually
gonna<00:03:18.530> help<00:03:18.620> tank<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.220> her<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.209> right

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
the rest of the buildings so at 54% we

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
the rest of the buildings so at 54% we
already<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.600> two<00:03:26.780> stars<00:03:27.110> Queens<00:03:27.890> gonna

only the multi targeted Inferno towers

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.970 
only the multi targeted Inferno towers
that<00:03:56.450> tend<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.780> take<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.049> witches<00:03:57.320> out<00:03:57.500> if<00:03:57.769> you

that tend to take the witches out if you

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.890 
that tend to take the witches out if you
can<00:03:58.130> find<00:03:58.340> a<00:03:58.430> base<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.790> only<00:03:59.000> has<00:03:59.269> one<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.690> or

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
can find a base that only has one it or

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.050 
can find a base that only has one it or
that<00:04:00.470> has<00:04:00.620> both<00:04:00.860> Inferno<00:04:01.370> towers<00:04:01.700> sets<00:04:01.940> a

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
that has both Inferno towers sets a

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.120 
that has both Inferno towers sets a
single<00:04:02.660> target<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.440> might<00:04:03.620> actually<00:04:03.830> have<00:04:04.070> a

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
single target you might actually have a

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.620 
single target you might actually have a
chance<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.459> 3<00:04:04.700> starring<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.150> maybe<00:04:05.360> if<00:04:05.540> you

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
chance of 3 starring it maybe if you

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.880 
chance of 3 starring it maybe if you
brought<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> couple<00:04:06.170> more<00:04:06.290> wizards<00:04:06.560> but

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
anyways let's attack this next base and

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.680 
anyways let's attack this next base and

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.720 
try to get two stars as well so luckily
for<00:04:11.870> us<00:04:12.200> we're<00:04:12.500> actually<00:04:12.650> finding<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.340> bunch<00:04:13.610> of

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
for us we're actually finding a bunch of

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.670 
for us we're actually finding a bunch of
different<00:04:14.090> bases<00:04:14.570> which<00:04:14.989> means<00:04:15.230> we<00:04:15.380> can<00:04:15.500> try

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
different bases which means we can try

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.650 
different bases which means we can try
this<00:04:15.739> against<00:04:16.130> almost<00:04:16.370> everything<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.209> at

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
this against almost everything and at

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.940 
this against almost everything and at
this<00:04:17.780> base<00:04:17.959> is<00:04:18.169> going<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.380> be<00:04:18.470> definitely<00:04:18.680> a

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
this base is going to be definitely a

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.469 
this base is going to be definitely a
little<00:04:19.280> bit<00:04:19.370> different<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.880> threat<00:04:20.180> so

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
little bit different of a threat so

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.029 
little bit different of a threat so
starting<00:04:20.900> off<00:04:20.989> I<00:04:21.229> just<00:04:21.440> dropped<00:04:21.650> all<00:04:21.830> of<00:04:21.950> my

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
starting off I just dropped all of my

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.560 
starting off I just dropped all of my
witches<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.460> wasn't<00:04:22.910> really<00:04:23.030> too<00:04:23.300> worried

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
witches I wasn't really too worried

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.000 
witches I wasn't really too worried
about<00:04:23.660> chopping<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.289> jump<00:04:24.590> spell<00:04:24.680> but<00:04:24.979> I

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
about chopping a jump spell but I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.840 
about chopping a jump spell but I
decided<00:04:25.400> at<00:04:25.580> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
decided at the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.420 
decided at the
second<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> would<00:04:27.260> just<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.830> open<00:04:28.010> up<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
second that I would just to open up the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.610 
second that I would just to open up the
base<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:29.300> more<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.570> my<00:04:29.660> skeletons<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.470> make

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
base to more of my skeletons and to make

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.110 
base to more of my skeletons and to make
sure<00:04:30.770> they<00:04:30.920> didn't<00:04:31.160> funnel<00:04:31.490> all<00:04:31.670> inside<00:04:32.060> of

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
sure they didn't funnel all inside of

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.570 
sure they didn't funnel all inside of
one<00:04:32.420> spot<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:33.110> Mordor<00:04:33.770> just<00:04:33.980> went<00:04:34.160> down<00:04:34.340> as

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
one spot so Mordor just went down as

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.070 
one spot so Mordor just went down as
well<00:04:34.760> as<00:04:34.850> a<00:04:34.880> giant<00:04:35.270> bomb<00:04:35.390> which<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.750> really

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
well as a giant bomb which is really

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.690 
well as a giant bomb which is really
good<00:04:36.260> we<00:04:36.530> also<00:04:36.710> attack<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.130> side<00:04:37.460> with<00:04:37.670> a

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
good we also attack the side with a

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.250 
good we also attack the side with a
single<00:04:38.030> targeted<00:04:38.420> Inferno<00:04:38.750> tower<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
single targeted Inferno tower and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.380 
single targeted Inferno tower and
another<00:04:39.620> giant<00:04:39.950> bomb<00:04:40.220> goes<00:04:40.490> down<00:04:40.730> so<00:04:41.270> we

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
another giant bomb goes down so we

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.880 
another giant bomb goes down so we
pretty<00:04:41.600> much<00:04:41.660> have<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.960> straight<00:04:42.290> shot<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
pretty much have a straight shot to the

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.680 
pretty much have a straight shot to the
center<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.370> don't<00:04:43.820> see<00:04:44.060> how<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.270> could<00:04:44.510> lose

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
center I don't see how we could lose

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.390 
center I don't see how we could lose
this<00:04:44.870> raid<00:04:45.170> unless<00:04:45.860> something<00:04:46.280> crazy

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
this raid unless something crazy

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.120 
this raid unless something crazy
happened<00:04:47.000> or<00:04:47.200> yeah<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.440> would<00:04:48.650> pretty<00:04:48.800> much<00:04:48.890> be

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
happened or yeah I would pretty much be

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.620 
happened or yeah I would pretty much be
the<00:04:49.160> only<00:04:49.400> way<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:49.730> could<00:04:49.850> lose<00:04:50.030> because<00:04:50.270> look

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the only way we could lose because look

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.270 
the only way we could lose because look
at<00:04:50.750> all<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:50.960> those<00:04:51.170> skeletons<00:04:51.740> in<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:51.980> center

multi<00:05:33.830> target<00:05:33.980> Inferno<00:05:34.520> tower<00:05:34.760> is<00:05:35.030> gonna<00:05:35.480> be

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
multi target Inferno tower is gonna be

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.150 
multi target Inferno tower is gonna be
able<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.810> take<00:05:35.990> those<00:05:36.140> guys<00:05:36.200> out<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.950> as<00:05:37.130> I

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
able to take those guys out and as I

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.010 
able to take those guys out and as I
think<00:05:37.520> like<00:05:37.910> ten<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.330> my<00:05:38.420> witches<00:05:38.810> move

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
think like ten of my witches move

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.810 
think like ten of my witches move
forward<00:05:39.620> they're<00:05:40.190> gonna<00:05:40.310> start<00:05:40.550> getting

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
forward they're gonna start getting

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.850 
forward they're gonna start getting
dangerously<00:05:41.450> close<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.080> flames<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.710> that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
dangerously close to the flames and that

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.250 
dangerously close to the flames and that
will<00:05:43.010> mark<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.490> end<00:05:43.730> of<00:05:43.970> their<00:05:44.270> life<00:05:44.540> so<00:05:44.930> even

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
will mark the end of their life so even

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.570 
will mark the end of their life so even
though<00:05:45.380> those<00:05:45.530> skeletons<00:05:46.040> are<00:05:46.190> popping<00:05:46.490> out

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
though those skeletons are popping out

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.260 
though those skeletons are popping out
like<00:05:46.610> crazy

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
like crazy

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.030 
like crazy
eventually<00:05:47.870> the<00:05:48.230> switches<00:05:48.770> will<00:05:48.890> get

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
eventually the switches will get

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.010 
eventually the switches will get
targeted<00:05:49.460> and<00:05:49.610> as<00:05:50.000> they<00:05:50.270> get<00:05:50.450> targeted<00:05:50.660> they

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
targeted and as they get targeted they

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.620 
targeted and as they get targeted they
will<00:05:51.170> slowly<00:05:51.500> go<00:05:51.830> down<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.370> yeah<00:05:53.090> looks<00:05:53.540> like

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
will slowly go down and yeah looks like

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.180 
will slowly go down and yeah looks like
we<00:05:53.840> only<00:05:54.020> have<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.350> Queen<00:05:54.530> left<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.890> destroy

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
we only have the Queen left to destroy

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.590 
we only have the Queen left to destroy
some<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:55.550> remaining<00:05:55.970> buildings<00:05:56.180> around

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
some of the remaining buildings around

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.290 
some of the remaining buildings around
the<00:05:56.750> base<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:58.190> overall<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.610> pretty<00:05:58.910> fun

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
the base so overall a pretty fun

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.360 
the base so overall a pretty fun
strategy<00:05:59.840> seeing<00:06:00.200> over<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.620> hundred<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.190> six

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
strategy seeing over a hundred and six

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.680 
strategy seeing over a hundred and six
or<00:06:01.490> I<00:06:01.520> guess<00:06:01.700> like<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.910> hundred<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.390> sixty

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
or I guess like a hundred and sixty

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.510 
or I guess like a hundred and sixty
skeletons<00:06:03.170> on<00:06:03.290> the<00:06:03.380> dot<00:06:03.590> come<00:06:04.190> out<00:06:04.340> of<00:06:04.460> the

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
skeletons on the dot come out of the

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.550 
skeletons on the dot come out of the
witches<00:06:04.820> is<00:06:04.970> crazy<00:06:05.210> because<00:06:05.450> again<00:06:05.840> 20

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
skeletons they spawn four witches at a

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.170 
skeletons they spawn four witches at a
time<00:06:08.720> from<00:06:08.990> or<00:06:09.290> four<00:06:09.500> skeleton<00:06:10.070> Wow<00:06:10.640> twenty

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
time from or four skeleton Wow twenty

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.240 
time from or four skeleton Wow twenty
witches<00:06:11.660> they<00:06:11.840> can<00:06:11.990> spawn<00:06:12.230> four<00:06:12.560> skeletons<00:06:13.130> at

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
witches they can spawn four skeletons at

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
twenty times eight is 160 so there's

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.320 
twenty times eight is 160 so there's
your<00:06:18.230> chief<00:06:18.500> Pat<00:06:18.770> math<00:06:19.010> right<00:06:19.280> there<00:06:19.520> for
