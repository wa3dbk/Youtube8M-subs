 these three loops again face loop 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.460
 then again 3 of 3 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.460

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:33.250
 knotted two rows of face loops then 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.420
 there is a second and third row 4 row of knit 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.420
 purl loops 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.800
 so 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:38.940
 knit 4 row and the fifth row we start 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.390
 knit repeating from the first row that is 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.660
 the pattern we have is repeated from first to 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:51.300
 tying up the fourth row 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.610
 such asterisks are obtained and knit 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.860
 then this pattern, that is, we start with 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:02.220
 first row knit from 3 3 1 facial 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.550
 then two rows of facial loops 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.780
 and a number of purl and so all the time 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.720
 This pattern is repeated. 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.370
 we get when knitting pattern with 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.730
 asterisk you can see asterisks 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.320
 the thread is larger, respectively, will be more 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:28.680
 so voluminous this pattern 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:31.200
 more stars will be visible to all 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.180
