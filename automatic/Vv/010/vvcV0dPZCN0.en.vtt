00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.319
 one first that nothing I am the 95 here 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.410
 in the game 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:14.190
 this appeared what today I'm going to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.170
 teaching in this tutorial is how to put 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 the signs to sell and buy things 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.330
 this what you occupy obviously is a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.130
 sign 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 everyone I think to do as if not 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.080
 stop or worse 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.210
 to do it is stopped by the paleto that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.509
 goes 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.469
 and these six with wood 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.469
 the weight of having 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.700
 what I'm going to do with the example that 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.460
 I'm going to do is with flint I'm going to put 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.930
 also here the east what they occupy is 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.700
 have the numbers of the items 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.740
 as elite as the east 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.590
 can use the take items or in the 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.380
 page of a section where they are all 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.630
 the items and with their respective number the 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.550
 respective number of each item in that 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.830
 flint equipment between 118 by 254 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.770
 64 and so 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.040
 this what they are going to do is catch the cole 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.930
 318 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.890
 put the sign up down 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890
 bring in square brackets 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.350
 then in the second line of signs of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.600
 pesos in money as you want can to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.600
 when they are going to sell later 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.530
 with all and external third the first 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.799
 that is how much they are going to sell 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.580
 each for that number the item that is 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.340
 318 the truth 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.369
 Log two points as here that space 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.310
 that I love you with space that goes together and 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.390
 the hits in which they will add number of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.969
 things so added add 15 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.430
 they already put 2 and 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.160
 discounted from here are already there for 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.380
 add them only with the item in your hand 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.360
 you right click and it's started 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.480
 they added in those who take 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.340
 what do you say for you sales and this is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.350
 so that you buy so that you buy your 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.510
 things and for example I'm going to this 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.510
 deterioration is going to set the example of 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.960
 diamond that they put in the first line goes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.130
 just really brackets and then here 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.560
 and I switched to the 1 of what many 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.560
 they will buy or to put those 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.140
 you want 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.820
 in the colon and puts the number of 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.270
 temple puts diamond that the number of 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.490
 264 diamonds 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.520
 and make one of the second line 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.569
 with the third line but the sign 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.189
 number counts the purchase 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.870
 you buy them then they buy me two 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.530
 points and the money that they will add 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.970
 it's work I'm going to add not be 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.870
 200 to buy the ones that are 10 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 and juli does not always have to fix 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.040
 how much money does it have focus but 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.439
 obviously going to come out in red on 3 is 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.159
 there are diamonds purchases and you already discounted me 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.870
 the money 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:28.120
 to see money is bar voucher and to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
 corner already comes with your time here 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.469
 I'm what I have why I'm just 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.790
 to count those 200 for the entourage 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.690
 sign 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.920
 I returned it shine 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.120
 OK 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.600
 I cut the video I do not know why it is 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.340
 here 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.790
 you see that my money that was for 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.220
 take it off 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.330
 but this 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.330
 and I have others 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.170
 well this had an error 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.100
 I already removed 200er mo yan if this was 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.790
 all 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.709
 this is what these same servers 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.709
 as works previously 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.200
 next crafter before merging with 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.900
 mime along with what it was 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.470
 it's horrendous if they're not from the server they're 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.470
 very good 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.950
 people like the server's capacity is 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.980
 of 256 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.160
 what time 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.680
 understand 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.710
 there are 120 now of 256 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.220
 very aware of the truth 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.990
 very very very little lacquer 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.150
 and a game of the case is beginning 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.780
 that was all 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.780
 OK
