hey guys and welcome to another let's
invent<00:00:03.360> video<00:00:03.750> today's<00:00:04.589> video<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.009> gonna<00:00:05.100> be

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
invent video today's video is gonna be

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.639 
invent video today's video is gonna be
rather<00:00:05.520> small<00:00:05.870> last<00:00:06.870> time<00:00:07.080> as<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.350> know<00:00:07.470> we

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
rather small last time as you know we

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.040 
rather small last time as you know we
didn't<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.519> actual<00:00:09.000> like<00:00:09.269> senses<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.929> made

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
didn't the actual like senses and made

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.200 
didn't the actual like senses and made
like<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> grown<00:00:11.130> level<00:00:11.460> liked<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.030> by

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
like a grown level liked here by

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.129 
like a grown level liked here by
actually<00:00:12.480> using<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> ideas<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
actually using one of the ideas that

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.109 
actually using one of the ideas that
actually<00:00:16.139> seen<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.470> dark<00:00:16.770> m77<00:00:17.490> channel<00:00:18.000> where

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
actually seen on dark m77 channel where

he made a lamppost here I know a couple

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.679 
he made a lamppost here I know a couple
of<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.070> guys<00:00:20.100> said<00:00:20.520> captain<00:00:20.910> sparkles<00:00:21.359> found

of you guys said captain sparkles found

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
of you guys said captain sparkles found
it<00:00:21.840> from<00:00:21.960> reddit<00:00:22.350> -<00:00:22.560> there's<00:00:23.519> quite<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.730> few

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it from reddit - there's quite a few

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.950 
it from reddit - there's quite a few
people<00:00:24.119> who<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.630> made<00:00:24.779> this

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
people who have actually made this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.730 
people who have actually made this
design<00:00:26.029> from<00:00:27.029> other<00:00:27.390> people's<00:00:27.660> ideas<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
design from other people's ideas so the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.800 
design from other people's ideas so the
actual<00:00:28.980> source<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.550> unknown<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.150> me<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.300> I

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
actual source is unknown to me but I

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
actual source is unknown to me but I
think<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.439> came<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:31.619> read<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> initially<00:00:32.579> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
think it came from read it initially but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
think it came from read it initially but
today<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.600> show<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> reset

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
today I'm gonna show you how to reset

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.370 
today I'm gonna show you how to reset
the<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> world<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.840> are<00:00:37.079> say

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the time in the world when you are say

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
the time in the world when you are say
in<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> creative<00:00:38.040> world<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.730> say<00:00:39.719> you're

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
in a creative world like so say you're

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.160 
in a creative world like so say you're
building<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:41.190> server<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.899> got

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
building on a server or you know you got

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
building on a server or you know you got
your<00:00:43.260> own<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.559> invention<00:00:44.280> world<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.820> so

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
your own little invention world like so

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.840 
your own little invention world like so
and<00:00:45.920> now<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> keep<00:00:47.520> printing

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and now you don't want to keep printing

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
and now you don't want to keep printing
in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> command<00:00:48.300> set<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:49.260> zero<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
in the command set time zero all the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
in the command set time zero all the
time<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.059> automated

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
time you just want something automated

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.130 
time you just want something automated
so<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> day<00:00:52.879> becomes<00:00:53.879> evening<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so that when the day becomes evening it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
so that when the day becomes evening it
actually<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.590> resets<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> time<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
actually just resets the time so you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
actually just resets the time so you
have<00:00:57.059> nothing<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> worry<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.649> what

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have nothing to worry about and so what

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.959 
have nothing to worry about and so what
I've<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.039> done<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.789> got<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
I've actually done here I've got a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.139 
I've actually done here I've got a
command<00:01:00.300> block<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:02.250> set<00:01:02.520> zero<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.030> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
command block with time set zero in it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.340 
command block with time set zero in it
you<00:01:03.270> obviously<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> does<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you obviously know what that does it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
you obviously know what that does it
just<00:01:04.379> makes<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> day<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.869> start<00:01:06.869> from<00:01:07.020> zero

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
just makes the day like start from zero

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
just makes the day like start from zero
so<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.830> cool<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.970> I've<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
so that's cool and I've actually got a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
so that's cool and I've actually got a
light<00:01:09.750> sensor<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.920> trail<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
light sensor here with a trail of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.780 
light sensor here with a trail of
redstone<00:01:11.850> go<00:01:12.420> into<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:12.990> inverter<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> know

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
redstone go into an inverter as you know

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
redstone go into an inverter as you know
this<00:01:14.970> actually<00:01:15.330> puts<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.750> signal<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.350> when

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this actually puts a signal out when

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.340 
this actually puts a signal out when
it's<00:01:16.830> daytime<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> light<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:17.880> actually

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
it's daytime so the light is actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.859 
it's daytime so the light is actually
being<00:01:19.350> converted<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> signal<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
being converted into a signal here the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
being converted into a signal here the
later<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.619> day<00:01:22.770> goes<00:01:23.100> obviously<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
later on the day goes obviously the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.960 
later on the day goes obviously the
signal<00:01:24.360> shrinks<00:01:25.130> therefore<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> signal<00:01:26.670> will

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
signal shrinks therefore the signal will

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.730 
signal shrinks therefore the signal will
be<00:01:27.180> cut<00:01:27.420> off<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.290> point<00:01:28.320> because

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
be cut off here at some point because

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.420 
be cut off here at some point because
the<00:01:29.009> strength<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.610> gonna<00:01:29.840> reduce<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> when<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the strength is gonna reduce so when the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
the strength is gonna reduce so when the
strength<00:01:32.729> reduces<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> signal<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
strength reduces from the signal and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.380 
strength reduces from the signal and
when<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> strength<00:01:35.220> reduces<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
when the strength reduces from the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.710 
when the strength reduces from the
actual<00:01:36.689> light<00:01:36.900> sensor<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.430> actually

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
actual light sensor this will actually

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.660 
actual light sensor this will actually
disconnect<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.140> here<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.250> signal

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
disconnect this one here and the signal

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
disconnect this one here and the signal
will<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:42.060> come<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.509> far<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> block<00:01:43.259> yeah

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
will only come as far as this block yeah

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.069 
will only come as far as this block yeah
as<00:01:43.710> soon<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.369> happens<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.180> inverter

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
as soon as that happens the inverter

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.490 
as soon as that happens the inverter
sends<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.680> pulse<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> command<00:01:47.820> block

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
sends a pulse to the command block

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.499 
sends a pulse to the command block
therefore<00:01:49.500> setting<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.880> daytime<00:01:51.270> or

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
therefore setting it to daytime or

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.859 
therefore setting it to daytime or
nighttime<00:01:52.140> daytime<00:01:52.799> sorry<00:01:53.479> very<00:01:54.479> simple

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
nighttime daytime sorry very simple

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.389 
nighttime daytime sorry very simple

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
in my own invention world like here

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.270 
in my own invention world like here
where<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> want<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.229> daytime<00:02:07.649> most<00:02:08.129> of

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
where you want it to be daytime most of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.729 
where you want it to be daytime most of
the<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.610> anyway<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.330> works<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.929> treat<00:02:10.200> works

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the time anyway it works the treat works

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.650 
the time anyway it works the treat works
a<00:02:10.920> treat<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.940> if<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.360> said<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
a treat more like so if I just said it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.080 
a treat more like so if I just said it
the<00:02:12.780> nighttime

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the nighttime

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.120 
the nighttime
doosh<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.390> actually<00:02:15.720> revert<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.740> daytime

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
doosh it actually revert back to daytime

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.700 
doosh it actually revert back to daytime
because<00:02:17.310> signal<00:02:18.000> drops<00:02:18.300> here<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.560> can

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
because signal drops here and you can

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.280 
because signal drops here and you can
set<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.160> whatever<00:02:20.430> string<00:02:21.150> no<00:02:21.300> signal

set it to whatever string no signal

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
set it to whatever string no signal
strength<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.800> want<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.250> depending<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.850> how

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
strength you want so depending on how

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.900 
strength you want so depending on how
long<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.360> actual<00:02:24.600> redstone<00:02:25.260> circuit<00:02:25.740> is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
long the actual redstone circuit is

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
gives the signal to the command block so

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.280 
gives the signal to the command block so
I've<00:02:32.040> got<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.310> set<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.490> one<00:02:32.760> two<00:02:33.270> three<00:02:33.810> four

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
I've got it set to one two three four

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.640 
I've got it set to one two three four
five<00:02:35.160> here<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.120> I'm<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:36.900> quite<00:02:37.170> sure<00:02:37.200> on

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
five here which I'm not quite sure on

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.970 
five here which I'm not quite sure on
how<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.780> explain<00:02:39.780> time<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.320> Minecraft<00:02:40.800> it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
how you explain time in Minecraft it's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.340 
how you explain time in Minecraft it's
telling<00:02:41.310> tix<00:02:41.580> I'm<00:02:41.850> assuming<00:02:42.570> ticks<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.170> stuff

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
telling tix I'm assuming ticks and stuff

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.850 
telling tix I'm assuming ticks and stuff
like<00:02:43.470> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
like that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.940 
like that
but<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.550> two<00:02:44.940> three<00:02:45.450> four<00:02:45.870> five<00:02:46.290> redstone

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
but one two three four five redstone

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.450 
but one two three four five redstone
makes<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.790> convert<00:02:48.240> back<00:02:48.540> into<00:02:48.900> daytime<00:02:49.460> at

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
makes it convert back into daytime at

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.160 
makes it convert back into daytime at
the<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:50.910> time<00:02:51.210> for<00:02:51.420> me<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.840> leave<00:02:51.990> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
the right time for me if you leave it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680 
the right time for me if you leave it
too<00:02:52.350> late<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.740> actually<00:02:53.100> becomes<00:02:53.850> desk<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
too late it actually becomes desk and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.560 
too late it actually becomes desk and
then<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.980> bit<00:02:56.130> too<00:02:56.280> dark<00:02:56.520> at<00:02:56.730> desk<00:02:57.000> time<00:02:57.330> so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
then it's a bit too dark at desk time so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.780 
then it's a bit too dark at desk time so
five<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:58.050> perfect<00:02:58.230> here<00:02:58.650> guys<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.760> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
five is perfect here guys and if you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.190 
five is perfect here guys and if you
know<00:02:59.970> anything<00:03:00.210> about<00:03:00.390> ticks<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.050> how

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
know anything about ticks and how

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.960 
know anything about ticks and how
