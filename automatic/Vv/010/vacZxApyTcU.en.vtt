guy that a lot of people early in the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.660 
guy that a lot of people early in the
season<00:01:52.140> were<00:01:52.350> saying<00:01:52.590> look<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.070> could<00:01:53.250> be

better if we didn't have to play Russell
Wilson<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.640> should<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.850> playing<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.149> Flynn

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
everything to see them this seemed like

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.059 
everything to see them this seemed like
taking<00:03:51.780> us<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.989> step<00:03:52.200> forward<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.829> most

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
taking us to step forward for the most

taking us to step forward for the most
part<00:03:53.310> defense<00:03:53.910> seems<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.269> take<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.569> step

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
part defense seems to take this step

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.539 
part defense seems to take this step
back<00:03:55.019> obviously<00:03:55.769> if<00:03:55.859> you<00:03:55.950> don't<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.250> Sherman

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
back obviously if you don't have Sherman

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.050 
back obviously if you don't have Sherman
and<00:03:56.700> browner<00:03:56.849> that's<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.480> problem<00:03:57.720> but<00:03:59.060> this

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and browner that's a problem but this

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.370 
and browner that's a problem but this
win<00:04:00.299> basically<00:04:00.750> if<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> could<00:04:01.049> have<00:04:01.139> asked

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
win basically if you could have asked

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.360 
win basically if you could have asked
