certain<00:00:13.380> way<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:14.219> wasn't<00:00:14.790> totally<00:00:15.269> happy

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
certain way I wasn't totally happy

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.950 
certain way I wasn't totally happy
because<00:00:16.379> since<00:00:16.740> Yorick<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.490> released<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.390> was

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
because since Yorick was released I was

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.870 
because since Yorick was released I was
very<00:00:19.199> interested<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.070> him<00:00:20.340> because<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> his

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
very interested in him because of his

very interested in him because of his
new<00:00:21.210> mechanics<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> girls<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
new mechanics with the girls and the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
new mechanics with the girls and the
thought<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> being<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:24.199> necromancer<00:00:25.199> was<00:00:25.590> good

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
thought of being a necromancer was good

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.120 
thought of being a necromancer was good
I<00:00:26.189> mean<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.060> seemed<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.539> fun<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.740> after<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I mean it seemed to be fun so after a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.820 
I mean it seemed to be fun so after a
few<00:00:29.340> months<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.179> actually<00:00:30.750> purchased<00:00:31.529> him

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
few months I actually purchased him

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799

didn't<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> before<00:00:32.759> because<00:00:33.149> everyone

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
didn't do it before because everyone

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
didn't do it before because everyone
else<00:00:34.020> said<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.100> terrible<00:00:35.700> and

else said that he was terrible and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.780 
else said that he was terrible and
immediately<00:00:36.840> started<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.649> enjoy<00:00:38.070> him<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> lot

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
immediately started to enjoy him a lot

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
immediately started to enjoy him a lot
few<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.809> later<00:00:40.200> he<00:00:40.379> became<00:00:40.739> my<00:00:41.190> main

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
few time later he became my main

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
few time later he became my main
champion<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.690> there<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:42.899> something<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
champion but there was something that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
champion but there was something that
was<00:00:43.920> wrong<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> champion<00:00:45.090> he<00:00:45.629> was<00:00:45.809> very

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
was wrong with the champion he was very

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
was wrong with the champion he was very
good<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.649> early<00:00:47.129> stages<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.149> his

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
good in the early stages because of his

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
good in the early stages because of his
her<00:00:48.480> ass<00:00:48.770> even<00:00:49.770> though<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.250> literally

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
her ass even though here literally

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.119 
her ass even though here literally
drinks<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.570> his<00:00:51.840> mana<00:00:52.140> being<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
drinks all his mana being this what I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.060 
drinks all his mana being this what I
thought<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> him<00:00:53.969> at<00:00:54.149> first<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.289> after<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> lot

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
thought of him at first but after a lot

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.209 
thought of him at first but after a lot
of<00:00:56.129> games<00:00:56.690> specially<00:00:57.690> custom<00:00:58.379> games<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:59.039> you

very little amount of wins even though I
play<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.580> game<00:01:05.850> since<00:01:06.240> season<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
play this game since season one I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.160 
play this game since season one I
managed<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> figure<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.299> how<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> harass

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
managed to figure out how to harass

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.550 
managed to figure out how to harass
properly<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.189> request<00:01:11.549> ngmoco<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:13.320> all

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
properly with your request ngmoco at all

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.999 
properly with your request ngmoco at all
and<00:01:14.060> still<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.360> high<00:01:15.630> amount<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> damage<00:01:16.619> early

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and still do high amount of damage early

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.090 
and still do high amount of damage early
on<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:18.750> noticed<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.619> useless

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
on and then I noticed how useless

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.820 
on and then I noticed how useless
Eureka's<00:01:20.939> endgame<00:01:21.450> when<00:01:21.720> building<00:01:21.990> him<00:01:22.470> tank

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
Eureka's endgame when building him tank

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
Eureka's endgame when building him tank
this<00:01:23.729> happens<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.869> you're<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> goes

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this happens because if you're it goes

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.330 
this happens because if you're it goes
tank<00:01:26.040> he's<00:01:26.310> totally<00:01:26.820> ignored<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.570> teamfights

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
tank he's totally ignored in teamfights

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.999 
tank he's totally ignored in teamfights
this<00:01:29.340> happens<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.509> has<00:01:30.720> no<00:01:30.960> decent<00:01:31.439> CC

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
this happens because he has no decent CC

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.270 
this happens because he has no decent CC
to<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.400> worth<00:01:32.610> attacking<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> his<00:01:34.470> damage<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to be worth attacking and his damage and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
to be worth attacking and his damage and
game<00:01:35.610> even<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> ghouls<00:01:36.689> isn't<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
game even with the ghouls isn't that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.640 
game even with the ghouls isn't that
much<00:01:37.790> so<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> thought<00:01:39.479> maybe<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.110> should<00:01:40.500> go

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
much so then I thought maybe I should go

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800 
much so then I thought maybe I should go
a<00:01:40.680> little<00:01:40.829> bit<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.549> more<00:01:41.759> damage<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> check

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
a little bit with more damage and check

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.920 
a little bit with more damage and check
out<00:01:43.049> how<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.500> goes<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> finally<00:01:45.270> putted

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
out how it goes when I finally putted

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
out how it goes when I finally putted
that<00:01:46.140> thought<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:47.090> Yorick<00:01:48.090> became<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> much

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that thought to use Yorick became a much

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.620 
that thought to use Yorick became a much
better<00:01:49.200> champion<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.670> he<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.180> no<00:01:51.420> longer

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
better champion because he was no longer

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.410 
better champion because he was no longer
ignore<00:01:51.990> abhi<00:01:52.530> cuz<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.009> his<00:01:53.159> girls<00:01:53.520> damage<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
ignore abhi cuz of his girls damage and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
ignore abhi cuz of his girls damage and
since<00:01:54.780> he<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:55.079> ranged<00:01:55.680> abilities<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.610> could

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
since he has ranged abilities I could

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
since he has ranged abilities I could
pretty<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.320> same<00:01:58.740> her<00:01:59.009> ass<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.430> did

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
pretty much do the same her ass I did

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.590 
pretty much do the same her ass I did
early<00:02:00.180> game<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.020> endgame<00:02:01.590> anyway<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.390> reason

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
early game but endgame anyway the reason

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
early game but endgame anyway the reason
why<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.290> writing<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.100> letter<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.759> because

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
why I'm writing this letter as because
