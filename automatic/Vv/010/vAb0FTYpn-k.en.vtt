00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
cameras is because unlike the GoPro

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
their true POV and when you put the

their true POV and when you put the
gopro<00:02:24.850> headstrap

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
gopro headstrap

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400

like you're super tall and you don't fit

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.309 
like you're super tall and you don't fit
you<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.450> view<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> little<00:02:37.230> bit

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
you know so the the view is a little bit

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.020 
you know so the the view is a little bit
off<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> GoPro<00:02:38.340> whereas<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:38.819> these

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
off with the GoPro whereas with these

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
off with the GoPro whereas with these
liquid<00:02:39.450> image<00:02:39.660> cameras<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.830> perfect<00:02:41.340> for

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
liquid image cameras it's perfect for

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.870 
liquid image cameras it's perfect for
driving<00:02:42.410> there<00:02:43.410> are<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.860> few<00:02:44.160> modes<00:02:44.459> with<00:02:44.730> this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
driving there are a few modes with this

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.820 
driving there are a few modes with this
camera<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> first<00:02:46.740> mode<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:48.530> they're<00:02:49.530> kind<00:02:49.800> of

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
camera the first mode is they're kind of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.729 
camera the first mode is they're kind of
determined<00:02:50.370> by<00:02:50.490> lights<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.000> colors<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.140> if

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
determined by lights and colors so if

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.960 
determined by lights and colors so if
you're<00:02:52.890> color<00:02:53.100> blind<00:02:53.190> you're<00:02:53.670> gonna<00:02:53.760> have

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you're color blind you're gonna have

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.330 
you're color blind you're gonna have
some<00:02:54.180> trouble<00:02:54.510> working<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.200> if<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.220> not

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
some trouble working this if you're not

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.150 
some trouble working this if you're not
though<00:02:56.550> you'll<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:56.819> alright

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
though you'll be alright

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.190 
though you'll be alright
the<00:02:59.160> first<00:02:59.400> mode<00:02:59.640> flashes<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.270> blue<00:03:00.630> light<00:03:00.989> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the first mode flashes a blue light and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.699 
the first mode flashes a blue light and
that<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.130> 720p<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.900> little<00:03:04.260> bit<00:03:04.500> wider

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
that is 720p and it's a little bit wider

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.870 
that is 720p and it's a little bit wider
angle<00:03:05.340> than<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.750> next<00:03:07.019> mode<00:03:07.230> which<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.400> green

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
angle than the next mode which is green

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.830 
angle than the next mode which is green
and<00:03:09.440> that's<00:03:10.440> 1080p<00:03:11.220> we<00:03:11.730> typically<00:03:12.150> only<00:03:12.450> film

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
and that's 1080p we typically only film

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.180 
and that's 1080p we typically only film
in<00:03:13.019> 720p<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.010> first<00:03:14.250> mode<00:03:14.519> which<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.420> blue<00:03:16.190> and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
in 720p the first mode which is blue and

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
in 720p the first mode which is blue and
then<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.910> green<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.600> can<00:03:18.750> get<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.110> bit

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
then the green you can get a little bit

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.080 
then the green you can get a little bit
more<00:03:19.350> detail<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.800> gauges<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.730> stuff<00:03:20.940> like

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
more detail of gauges and stuff like

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.790 
more detail of gauges and stuff like
that<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.650> then<00:03:22.860> there's<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.550> purple<00:03:24.800> mode

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
that and then there's a purple mode

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.340 
that and then there's a purple mode
which<00:03:26.100> takes<00:03:26.700> pictures<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.840> think<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.140> red

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
which takes pictures and I think a red

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.500 
which takes pictures and I think a red
that<00:03:28.590> takes<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.070> multiple<00:03:30.000> pictures<00:03:30.150> I've

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that takes like multiple pictures I've

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.000 
that takes like multiple pictures I've
never<00:03:30.720> really<00:03:31.049> used<00:03:31.079> those<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.739> don't<00:03:31.799> know

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
never really used those I don't know

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.300 
never really used those I don't know
much<00:03:32.190> about<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.470> that's<00:03:34.739> what<00:03:34.920> we<00:03:35.010> use<00:03:35.160> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
much about that so that's what we use to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.289 
much about that so that's what we use to
shoot<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.640> POV<00:03:35.970> test<00:03:36.450> drives<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:38.280> look<00:03:38.459> kind

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
shoot the POV test drives you look kind

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.050 
shoot the POV test drives you look kind
of<00:03:39.390> ridiculous<00:03:39.690> wearing<00:03:40.200> them<00:03:41.060> driving

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
of ridiculous wearing them driving

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.590 
of ridiculous wearing them driving
around

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
around

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.539 
around
that's<00:03:43.410> why<00:03:43.560> I'd<00:03:43.709> recommend<00:03:44.220> getting<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
that's why I'd recommend getting the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:45.710 
that's why I'd recommend getting the
black<00:03:44.760> ones<00:03:45.030> because<00:03:45.269> they're<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> little<00:03:45.600> bit

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
black ones because they're a little bit

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.400 
black ones because they're a little bit
more<00:03:46.160> discreet<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> little<00:03:48.959> while<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.170> had<00:03:49.380> a

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
more discreet for a little while I had a

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.949 
more discreet for a little while I had a
set<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.829> white<00:03:50.100> impact<00:03:50.670> goggles<00:03:51.239> liquidating

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
set of white impact goggles liquidating

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.170 
set of white impact goggles liquidating
image<00:03:52.230> impact<00:03:52.680> goggles<00:03:53.100> those<00:03:53.700> work<00:03:53.940> really

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
image impact goggles those work really

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.890 
image impact goggles those work really
well<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.959> they<00:03:55.260> were<00:03:55.320> white<00:03:55.970> now<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.480> audio

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
well but they were white now the audio

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.289 
well but they were white now the audio
portion<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.890> our<00:03:59.370> videos<00:03:59.700> is<00:03:59.970> really

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
portion of our videos is really

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.819 
portion of our videos is really
interesting<00:04:01.010> because<00:04:02.360> we<00:04:03.360> use<00:04:03.829> binaural

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
interesting because we use binaural

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.000 
interesting because we use binaural
audio<00:04:06.200> if<00:04:07.200> you've<00:04:07.380> never<00:04:07.560> heard<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.860> by

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
audio if you've never heard of by

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.509 
audio if you've never heard of by
Knoller<00:04:08.280> all<00:04:08.459> binaural<00:04:09.120> audio<00:04:09.450> before

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
Knoller all binaural audio before

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.090 
Knoller all binaural audio before
basically<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:12.390> idea<00:04:12.750> behind<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:13.350> is<00:04:13.500> if<00:04:13.920> you

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
basically the idea behind it is if you

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.990 
basically the idea behind it is if you
record<00:04:15.229> right<00:04:16.229> channel<00:04:16.680> audio<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.910> your

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
record right channel audio and your

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.699 
record right channel audio and your
right<00:04:18.209> ear<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.600> left<00:04:18.660> channel<00:04:19.169> audio<00:04:19.410> and

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
right ear and left channel audio and

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.560 
right ear and left channel audio and
your<00:04:19.769> left<00:04:19.979> ear<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:20.910> two<00:04:21.180> separate

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
your left ear you have two separate

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.690 
your left ear you have two separate
microphones<00:04:22.169> one<00:04:22.590> for<00:04:22.800> each<00:04:22.890> channel<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
microphones one for each channel and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.730 
microphones one for each channel and
they<00:04:24.600> go<00:04:24.810> in<00:04:24.960> your<00:04:25.080> ears<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:25.620> like

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
they go in your ears just like

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.570 
they go in your ears just like
headphones<00:04:27.320> when<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.410> listen<00:04:28.830> back<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.430> that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
headphones when you listen back to that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.930 
headphones when you listen back to that
audio<00:04:30.000> with<00:04:30.810> headphones<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.770> computer<00:04:32.220> it

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
audio with headphones on the computer it

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.440 
audio with headphones on the computer it
gives<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.450> impression<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:34.140> 3d<00:04:34.470> sound<00:04:35.450> now

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
gives you the impression of 3d sound now

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.650 
gives you the impression of 3d sound now
this<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.229> because<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:38.610> way<00:04:38.849> that

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
this is because the way that

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.780 
this is because the way that
bounces<00:04:40.200> around<00:04:40.500> your<00:04:40.710> head<00:04:40.920> into<00:04:41.460> your<00:04:41.580> ear

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
bounces around your head into your ear

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.650 
bounces around your head into your ear
canal<00:04:42.650> that's<00:04:43.650> what<00:04:43.920> enables<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.580> enables<00:04:45.540> you

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
canal that's what enables it enables you

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.420 
canal that's what enables it enables you
to<00:04:45.690> this<00:04:45.960> like<00:04:46.140> here<00:04:46.650> where<00:04:46.860> sounds<00:04:47.340> are

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
to this like here where sounds are

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.610 
to this like here where sounds are
coming<00:04:47.550> from<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.180> kind<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.810> feel<00:04:49.230> where<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
coming from and kind of feel where the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.440 
coming from and kind of feel where the
engine<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.310> where<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.550> exhaust<00:04:50.910> note<00:04:51.270> is

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
engine is and where the exhaust note is

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.910 
engine is and where the exhaust note is
and<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:53.040> know<00:04:53.160> when<00:04:53.310> cars<00:04:53.580> pass<00:04:54.110> past<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.410> on

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
and you know when cars pass past you on

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.940 
and you know when cars pass past you on
the<00:04:55.950> highway<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.460> know<00:04:56.730> in<00:04:57.090> these<00:04:57.330> videos

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
the highway you know in these videos

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.230 
the highway you know in these videos
that's<00:04:58.950> why<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.160> feels<00:04:59.310> so<00:04:59.550> realistic

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
that's why it feels so realistic

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.270 
that's why it feels so realistic
let's<00:05:01.050> go<00:05:01.170> because<00:05:01.470> I'm<00:05:01.590> using<00:05:01.770> binaural

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
let's go because I'm using binaural

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.120 
let's go because I'm using binaural
microphones<00:05:03.150> they<00:05:03.450> go<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.720> my<00:05:03.840> ears<00:05:04.130> so

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
microphones they go in my ears so

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.290 
microphones they go in my ears so
there's<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.030> few<00:05:06.540> different<00:05:07.020> ones<00:05:07.140> of<00:05:07.380> these<00:05:07.500> I

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
there's a few different ones of these I

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.540 
there's a few different ones of these I
think<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.390> ones<00:05:09.600> I've<00:05:10.380> purchased<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:11.280> I've

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
think the ones I've purchased and I've

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.970 
think the ones I've purchased and I've
really<00:05:11.880> liked<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.480> have<00:05:13.260> worked<00:05:13.500> well<00:05:13.800> are

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
really liked and have worked well are

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.820 
really liked and have worked well are
from<00:05:14.190> sound<00:05:14.490> professionals<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:16.470> you<00:05:16.710> can

just google sound professionals binaural
mic<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:22.010> find<00:05:23.010> find<00:05:23.640> something<00:05:23.940> that<00:05:24.090> works

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
mic and find find something that works

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.210 
mic and find find something that works
they're<00:05:24.990> not<00:05:25.140> too<00:05:25.290> expensive<00:05:25.560> they're<00:05:26.040> under

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
they're not too expensive they're under

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.620 
they're not too expensive they're under
a<00:05:26.250> hundred<00:05:26.370> dollars<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.240> think<00:05:27.420> there's<00:05:27.570> a

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
a hundred dollars and I think there's a

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.030 
a hundred dollars and I think there's a
little<00:05:27.780> higher<00:05:27.990> end<00:05:28.260> remodel<00:05:28.680> that<00:05:28.800> might<00:05:28.920> be

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
little higher end remodel that might be

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.390 
little higher end remodel that might be
a<00:05:29.070> little<00:05:29.220> bit<00:05:29.310> more<00:05:30.440> if<00:05:31.440> you're<00:05:31.800> shooting

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
a little bit more if you're shooting

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.600 
a little bit more if you're shooting
this<00:05:33.030> with<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:35.660> DSLR<00:05:36.660> some<00:05:37.440> DSLRs<00:05:38.070> will<00:05:38.280> power

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
this with a DSLR some DSLRs will power

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.710 
this with a DSLR some DSLRs will power
the<00:05:38.820> microphones<00:05:39.300> because<00:05:39.480> these

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
the microphones because these

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.900 
the microphones because these
microphones<00:05:40.230> don't<00:05:40.620> have<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.250> battery<00:05:41.700> with

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
microphones don't have a battery with

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.820 
microphones don't have a battery with
them<00:05:42.120> they're<00:05:42.330> just<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.810> cable<00:05:43.140> and<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.620> mic

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
them they're just a cable and a mic

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.540 
them they're just a cable and a mic
that's<00:05:44.130> it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
that's it

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.270 
that's it
so<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.300> need<00:05:45.450> a<00:05:45.480> way<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:45.690> power<00:05:45.930> them<00:05:46.230> to<00:05:46.560> you

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
so you need a way to power them to you

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.210 
so you need a way to power them to you
know<00:05:47.370> get<00:05:47.550> loud<00:05:47.760> loud<00:05:48.510> sounds<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.230> not<00:05:49.440> you

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
fuzzy my DSLR my d600 will power these

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.100 
fuzzy my DSLR my d600 will power these
mics<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:58.669> for<00:05:59.669> recording<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.510> need<00:06:00.630> a<00:06:00.690> you

know for like the POV portion you're
gonna<00:06:03.180> need<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.780> separate<00:06:05.180> recorder<00:06:06.180> so<00:06:06.390> I<00:06:06.419> have

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
gonna need a separate recorder so I have

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:13.700 
gonna need a separate recorder so I have
this<00:06:07.850> it's<00:06:08.850> a<00:06:09.030> zoom<00:06:10.700> h2n<00:06:11.700> handy<00:06:12.600> recorder<00:06:12.810> here

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
this it's a zoom h2n handy recorder here

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.260 
this it's a zoom h2n handy recorder here
it<00:06:13.830> is<00:06:13.950> and<00:06:15.470> basically<00:06:16.470> I<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.940> turn<00:06:17.940> that<00:06:17.970> on

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
it is and basically I just turn that on

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.550 
it is and basically I just turn that on
set<00:06:19.050> it<00:06:19.169> to<00:06:19.490> external<00:06:20.490> power<00:06:20.730> in<00:06:21.080> the<00:06:22.080> settings

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
set it to external power in the settings

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.430 
set it to external power in the settings
it'll<00:06:22.830> power<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.250> mics<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:24.480> said<00:06:25.110> that<00:06:25.260> I

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
it'll power the mics and I said that I

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.440 
it'll power the mics and I said that I
used<00:06:25.770> to<00:06:25.890> set<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.190> gain<00:06:26.370> on<00:06:26.580> auto<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:27.180> it

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
used to set the gain on auto and it

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.030 
used to set the gain on auto and it
would<00:06:27.570> kind<00:06:27.750> of<00:06:27.780> adjust<00:06:28.140> automatically<00:06:28.830> but

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
would kind of adjust automatically but

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.920 
would kind of adjust automatically but
when<00:06:29.640> I<00:06:29.669> floored<00:06:30.090> it<00:06:30.240> in<00:06:30.330> some<00:06:30.510> really<00:06:30.690> loud

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
when I floored it in some really loud

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.430 
when I floored it in some really loud
cars<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:32.160> would<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:33.330> kind<00:06:33.630> of<00:06:33.690> get<00:06:34.020> all<00:06:34.140> quiet

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
cars it would it kind of get all quiet

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.050 
cars it would it kind of get all quiet
all<00:06:34.770> of<00:06:34.950> a<00:06:35.010> sudden<00:06:35.280> because<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.730> compensate

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
all of a sudden because it to compensate

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.360 
all of a sudden because it to compensate
for<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.510> louder<00:06:36.690> noise<00:06:36.990> so<00:06:37.800> I<00:06:37.830> just<00:06:38.010> left<00:06:38.190> it

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
for the louder noise so I just left it

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.530 
for the louder noise so I just left it
on<00:06:38.570> manual<00:06:39.680> gain<00:06:40.680> it's<00:06:40.950> like<00:06:41.130> six<00:06:41.970> or<00:06:42.150> six<00:06:42.450> and

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
on manual gain it's like six or six and
