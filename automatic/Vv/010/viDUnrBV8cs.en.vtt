00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.000
 so please excuse that 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.700
 maybe a little wobbly 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.560
 show you how my tomatoes in 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:24.759
 greenhouse look at me 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.759
 they are not that big this year though 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:33.320
 There are enough tomatoes on it 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.390
 this again set to very quickly 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.070
 compensate 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.320
 Maybe you see there is a shoot 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.719
 who gets out of a fork 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:53.300
 be done away 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:55.940
 these are the plants that are here 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.789
 my ox heart tomatoes 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:06.189
 They look pretty good and me 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.530
 I hope so many of them 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:13.990
 continue to grow 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.990
 here I have bottled tomatoes 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:37.119
 they are delicious too 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:40.420
 first colored tomatoes for looks up 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:46.119
 my other side from the greenhouse he 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:51.400
 Somewhat out of the tomatoes that were mine 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.050
 already when sowing not so very good 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.899
 have appeared but I still have 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:04.080
 let it and keep growing 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:08.140
 maybe there will be something down here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.160
 Do you see my lemon tree that is allowed 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.769
 be here in the garden this summer 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.630
 Of course, in the fall it has to be purely because 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.630
 that does not tolerate frost 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.910
 Now I'll take you out to the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.910
 cucumbers 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.720
 you are looking very good this year 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.969
 the snake cucumbers are also right there 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:46.060

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.060
 have cucumber salad that's how it has to be 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.519
 otherwise there is a lot to do here 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:15.890
 And our plum hangs pretty well 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 I have a flowerpot full right there 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.250
 it is attached to a branch and straw 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:28.370
 so inside, earless 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.570
 inside have to at home can 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.570
 finished aphids 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.920
