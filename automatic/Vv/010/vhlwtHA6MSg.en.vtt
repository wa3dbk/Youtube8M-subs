00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
give it a good blend this is where it's

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.400 
give it a good blend this is where it's
going<00:01:43.240> to<00:01:43.300> get<00:01:43.390> noisy<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:44.110> we're<00:01:44.230> going<00:01:44.350> to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
going to get noisy and we're going to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.230 
going to get noisy and we're going to
have<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.920> skins<00:01:45.220> basically<00:01:45.850> coming<00:01:46.120> off

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
have all the skins basically coming off

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.840 
have all the skins basically coming off
and<00:01:46.390> making<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.750> nice<00:01:46.900> mess<00:01:47.320> in<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.710> milk

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.760

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
okay so that's all nicely mixed in quite

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.490 
okay so that's all nicely mixed in quite
brown<00:02:00.100> as<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:00.520> can<00:02:00.700> see<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:02.080> what<00:02:02.229> we<00:02:02.320> need<00:02:02.470> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
brown as you can see so what we need to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.440 
brown as you can see so what we need to
do<00:02:02.740> now<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.009> could<00:02:03.460> drink<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.820> as<00:02:03.939> it<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.180> but

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
do now you could drink it as it is but

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.530 
do now you could drink it as it is but
you<00:02:04.509> could<00:02:04.810> actually<00:02:06.000> strain<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.210> which<00:02:07.390> is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
you could actually strain it which is

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
you could actually strain it which is
what<00:02:07.689> we're<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:07.990> do<00:02:08.110> here<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.890> just

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
what we're going to do here is a just

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.150 
what we're going to do here is a just
simple<00:02:10.000> nylon<00:02:10.390> mesh<00:02:10.599> nut<00:02:10.989> milk<00:02:11.200> bag<00:02:11.260> it's<00:02:12.040> also

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
simple nylon mesh nut milk bag it's also

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.910 
simple nylon mesh nut milk bag it's also
used<00:02:12.489> for<00:02:12.640> sprouting<00:02:13.270> but<00:02:14.230> most<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.650> all<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:14.800> use

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
used for sprouting but most of all I use

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.770 
used for sprouting but most of all I use
it<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.430> straining<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.940> nut<00:02:16.090> milk<00:02:16.239> we<00:02:16.569> want<00:02:16.720> to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
it for straining the nut milk we want to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.750 
it for straining the nut milk we want to
get<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.260> bits<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> skin<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.459> milk

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
get all the bits of the skin out of milk

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.690 
get all the bits of the skin out of milk
so<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.420> nice<00:02:19.569> clean<00:02:20.020> milk<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:21.310> just<00:02:21.489> simply

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
so it's a nice clean milk so just simply

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.220 
so it's a nice clean milk so just simply
put<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:21.910> over<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.239> jug<00:02:22.510> or<00:02:22.660> some<00:02:22.840> other<00:02:22.989> large

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
put it over a jug or some other large

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.710 
put it over a jug or some other large
container<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.100> bowl<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.510> pour

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
container like a bowl and then just pour

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.449 
container like a bowl and then just pour
it<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:28.080> okay<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.880> then<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:32.040> secure<00:02:33.040> like

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
it in okay and then just secure like

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.070 
it in okay and then just secure like
this<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:35.190> strain<00:02:36.190> through<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> bag<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.930> if

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
this and strain through the bag now if

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.080 
this and strain through the bag now if
you<00:02:38.200> had<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> fine<00:02:38.680> sieve<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.459> could<00:02:39.670> use<00:02:39.850> that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you had a fine sieve you could use that

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.300 
you had a fine sieve you could use that
but<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:41.049> have<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.350> say<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.799> much<00:02:41.980> prefer

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
but I have to say that I much prefer

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.390 
but I have to say that I much prefer
using<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> bag<00:02:43.620> I've<00:02:44.620> got<00:02:44.799> more<00:02:44.950> effective

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
using the bag I've got more effective

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.890 
using the bag I've got more effective
quite<00:02:45.819> therapeutic<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.510> good

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
quite therapeutic and you get a good

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.400 
quite therapeutic and you get a good
result

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.110 

okay<00:02:53.410> so<00:02:53.470> we're<00:02:53.739> nearly<00:02:53.920> done<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.730> pulps

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
okay so we're nearly done the pulps

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.650 
okay so we're nearly done the pulps
getting<00:02:55.900> quite<00:02:56.170> dry<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:58.060> see<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:58.569> the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
getting quite dry as you can see in the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.449 
getting quite dry as you can see in the
bag<00:02:58.810> all<00:02:59.140> that's<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.530> left<00:02:59.650> now<00:03:00.040> is<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
bag all that's really left now is the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.300 
bag all that's really left now is the
own<00:03:00.609> pulp<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.359> this<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.260> be<00:03:02.350> used<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.980> various

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
own pulp and this can be used in various

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.120 
own pulp and this can be used in various
other<00:03:03.489> recipes<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.980> dehydrated<00:03:05.980> crackers

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
other recipes like dehydrated crackers

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.780 
other recipes like dehydrated crackers
burgers<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.239> kind<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.510> thing<00:03:08.579> also<00:03:09.579> can<00:03:09.730> be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
burgers that kind of thing also can be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.000 
burgers that kind of thing also can be
dehydrate<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:10.570> made<00:03:10.720> into<00:03:10.959> almond<00:03:11.290> flour<00:03:11.560> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
dehydrate and made into almond flour so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.340 
dehydrate and made into almond flour so
it's<00:03:12.160> quite<00:03:12.400> versatile<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.959> we're<00:03:14.109> going<00:03:14.260> to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
it's quite versatile but we're going to

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.949 
it's quite versatile but we're going to
just<00:03:14.500> put<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.160> side<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.630> use<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
just put that to one side and use the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.840 
just put that to one side and use the
milk<00:03:17.290> okay<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:17.530> here's<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.100> here's<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.640> pure

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
glass you can see how it looks it's very

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.250 
glass you can see how it looks it's very
lovely<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:23.890> frothy<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:25.660> can<00:03:25.870> drink<00:03:26.109> it

lovely and frothy and you can drink it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.050 
lovely and frothy and you can drink it
straight<00:03:26.380> like<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:27.040> but<00:03:27.549> personally<00:03:27.970> I

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
straight like this but personally I

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.750 
straight like this but personally I
prefer<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.510> add<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.660> few<00:03:28.900> dates<00:03:29.109> I<00:03:30.100> think<00:03:30.640> this

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
prefer to add a few dates I think this

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.550 
prefer to add a few dates I think this
is<00:03:30.970> like<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.209> seven<00:03:31.600> out<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.750> ten<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.170> terms<00:03:32.380> of

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
is like a seven out of ten in terms of

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.259 
is like a seven out of ten in terms of
taste<00:03:32.739> but<00:03:33.160> as<00:03:33.220> soon<00:03:33.370> as<00:03:33.489> you<00:03:33.579> add<00:03:33.700> dates<00:03:33.970> just

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
taste but as soon as you add dates just

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.210 
taste but as soon as you add dates just
two<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.630> three<00:03:34.660> medjool<00:03:35.170> dates<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.739> turns<00:03:35.980> into

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
two or three medjool dates it turns into

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.220 
two or three medjool dates it turns into
a<00:03:36.310> completely<00:03:36.700> different<00:03:36.820> drink<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:38.019> that's

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
a completely different drink so that's

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.150 
a completely different drink so that's
what<00:03:38.350> I'm<00:03:38.410> going<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.560> do<00:03:38.680> I'm<00:03:38.799> going<00:03:38.890> to<00:03:38.980> pour

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
what I'm going to do I'm going to pour

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.599 
what I'm going to do I'm going to pour

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
it back pour it back into the Vitamix

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.740 
it back pour it back into the Vitamix
jar

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.230 

nice<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.710> clean<00:03:46.890> now<00:03:47.130> no<00:03:47.340> pieces<00:03:47.610> in<00:03:47.880> at<00:03:48.030> all

now<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.530> use<00:03:49.560> module<00:03:49.980> days<00:03:50.280> as<00:03:50.490> I

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
now I'm going to use module days as I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.070 
now I'm going to use module days as I
say<00:03:50.760> these<00:03:51.000> are<00:03:51.120> my<00:03:51.210> favorite<00:03:51.660> dates<00:03:51.840> because

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
say these are my favorite dates because

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.560 
say these are my favorite dates because
they're<00:03:52.320> nice<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.530> moist<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.400> juicy<00:03:54.180> and

they're nice and moist and juicy and
have<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.750> lot<00:03:54.990> of<00:03:55.020> depth<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.620> flavor<00:03:55.710> so

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
have a lot of depth to the flavor so

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.010 
have a lot of depth to the flavor so
they<00:03:56.370> bring<00:03:56.580> an<00:03:56.670> almost<00:03:56.970> caramel<00:03:57.450> like<00:03:57.660> flavor

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
they bring an almost caramel like flavor
