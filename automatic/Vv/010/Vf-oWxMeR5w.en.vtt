00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
all non cancerous so I'm very thankful

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.520 
all non cancerous so I'm very thankful
for<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:36.210> he<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:36.989> took<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
for that and he also took the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.549 
for that and he also took the
steri-strip<00:00:38.070> off<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
steri-strip off so you can see the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
steri-strip off so you can see the
incision<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.969> think<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.239> did<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> really

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
incision and I think he did a really

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
incision and I think he did a really
good<00:00:42.930> job<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.530> closing<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:47.039> still

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
good job of closing it up so it's still

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.720

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
so those are like two things that have

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.860 
so those are like two things that have
really<00:02:14.890> been<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> problem<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.630> coughing

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.690 
really been a problem it's up coughing
especially<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.770> night<00:02:17.950> when<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.520> lay<00:02:18.670> down

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
especially like at night when I lay down

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.900 
especially like at night when I lay down
and<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.150> sleep<00:02:19.240> I'll<00:02:19.630> start<00:02:20.230> coughing<00:02:20.470> it's

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
and go to sleep I'll start coughing it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.130 
and go to sleep I'll start coughing it's
really<00:02:21.910> annoying<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> got<00:02:22.630> some<00:02:22.870> halls

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
really annoying but I got some halls

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.630 
really annoying but I got some halls
defense<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.990> lozenges<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.200> stuff<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:26.640> so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
defense a little lozenges to stuff on so

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.890 
defense a little lozenges to stuff on so
we'll<00:02:28.120> see<00:02:28.150> if<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.360> helps

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
we'll see if that helps

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.760 
we'll see if that helps
I<00:02:28.930> also<00:02:29.530> got<00:02:29.740> mederma<00:02:30.310> for<00:02:30.790> my<00:02:30.970> scar<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> my

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
I also got mederma for my scar so my

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.620 
I also got mederma for my scar so my
physician<00:02:33.190> said<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.400> could<00:02:33.670> use<00:02:33.700> either<00:02:34.330> that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
physician said I could use either that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.130 
physician said I could use either that
or<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.840> regular<00:02:35.970> lotion<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.450> felt<00:02:37.990> you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
or just regular lotion but I felt you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.410 
or just regular lotion but I felt you
know<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.830> would<00:02:39.070> rather<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.640> scar<00:02:39.970> with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
know this would rather do the scar with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.630 
know this would rather do the scar with
Mederma<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.800> think<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.220> way<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
Mederma and I think the way I'm going to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.120 
Mederma and I think the way I'm going to
apply<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.240> take<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> q-tip<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.470> apply

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
apply it is take a q-tip and just apply

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.930 
apply it is take a q-tip and just apply
it<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:46.540> crease<00:02:46.570> there<00:02:47.670> right<00:02:48.670> over<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
it in the crease there right over the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.220 
it in the crease there right over the
scar<00:02:49.180> because<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.510> actually<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.080> first

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
scar because I actually the first

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.410 
scar because I actually the first
application<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.890> put<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.280> around<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.820> it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
application I put all around and it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.960 
application I put all around and it
started<00:02:52.780> peeling<00:02:53.020> so<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:54.010> mean<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.610> haven't<00:02:54.760> used

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
started peeling so I mean I haven't used

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.920 
started peeling so I mean I haven't used
it<00:02:55.090> before<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.720> if<00:02:55.780> that's

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
it before so I don't know if that's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.370 
it before so I don't know if that's
normal<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:57.610> yeah<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:58.870> I'll<00:02:59.080> do<00:02:59.260> that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
normal or not but yeah so I'll do that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.410 
normal or not but yeah so I'll do that
and<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.650> says<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.980> use<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.280> three<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.240> four

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
and it says to use it three to four

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
and it says to use it three to four
times<00:03:01.570> a<00:03:01.810> day<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.710> I'll<00:03:02.800> plan<00:03:03.010> to
