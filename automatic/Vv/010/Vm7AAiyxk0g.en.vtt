your<00:00:40.510> plants<00:00:41.019> would<00:00:41.170> like<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.590> do<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:41.890> same

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
your plants would like to do the same

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.160 
your plants would like to do the same
thing<00:00:42.340> when<00:00:42.519> your<00:00:42.670> container<00:00:43.059> gardening<00:00:43.570> so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
thing when your container gardening so

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.840 
thing when your container gardening so
you<00:00:44.230> want<00:00:44.590> a<00:00:44.679> fabric<00:00:45.129> that<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.550> breathable

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
that is porous it doesn't hold in heat

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.360 
that is porous it doesn't hold in heat
plastic<00:00:49.269> tends<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.809> trap<00:00:50.109> heat<00:00:50.469> also<00:00:51.250> in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
plastic tends to trap heat also in

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.060 
plastic tends to trap heat also in
plastic<00:00:51.789> roots<00:00:52.030> circle<00:00:52.660> around<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.499> edges

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070

container in a smart pot and that's a

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.160 
container in a smart pot and that's a
huge<00:01:03.339> benefit<00:01:03.940> for<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.390> plant<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.989> course

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
huge benefit for the plant and of course

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.210 
huge benefit for the plant and of course
if<00:01:05.290> you<00:01:05.350> can<00:01:05.500> produce<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.890> better<00:01:05.920> root

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
if you can produce a better root

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.720 
if you can produce a better root
structure<00:01:06.610> on<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:06.850> plant<00:01:07.120> what<00:01:08.050> do<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.200> know

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
structure on the plant what do you know

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.670 
structure on the plant what do you know
voila<00:01:09.730> you<00:01:10.240> get<00:01:10.480> you<00:01:10.810> get<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> much<00:01:11.409> better

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
voila you get you get a much better

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
voila you get you get a much better
plant<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:13.560> benefit<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.710> growing<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.159> these<00:01:15.340> is

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
plant the benefit of growing in these is

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.460 
plant the benefit of growing in these is
we<00:01:16.000> have<00:01:16.270> drink<00:01:16.720> really<00:01:17.049> good<00:01:17.200> drainage

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
we have drink really good drainage

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.920 
we have drink really good drainage
waters<00:01:18.159> not<00:01:19.060> going<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.299> pull<00:01:19.509> up<00:01:19.689> in<00:01:19.810> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
waters not going to pull up in the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.530 
waters not going to pull up in the
bottom<00:01:20.290> it's<00:01:20.590> safe<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.729> bottom<00:01:22.119> here<00:01:22.329> has<00:01:22.509> a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
bottom it's safe the bottom here has a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.600 
bottom it's safe the bottom here has a
million<00:01:23.110> holes<00:01:23.350> through<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.799> so<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:24.280> get

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
million holes through it so you get

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.929 
million holes through it so you get
total<00:01:25.090> drainage<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.560> don't<00:01:26.799> get<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.909> know

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
total drainage so you don't get you know

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.810 
total drainage so you don't get you know
a<00:01:28.060> puddle<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.840> plastic<00:01:29.350> pot<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:30.130> tend<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.549> be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
a puddle in a plastic pot you tend to be

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.940 
a puddle in a plastic pot you tend to be
a<00:01:30.850> little<00:01:31.119> dry<00:01:31.329> on<00:01:31.810> top<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.500> little<00:01:32.710> wet<00:01:32.920> on

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
a little dry on top and little wet on

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.039 
a little dry on top and little wet on
the<00:01:33.189> bottom<00:01:33.219> and<00:01:33.909> you<00:01:34.030> try<00:01:34.299> to<00:01:34.360> work<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.990> out

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
the bottom and you try to work that out

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.139 
the bottom and you try to work that out
we'll<00:01:35.439> in<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.740> fabric<00:01:36.009> aeration<00:01:36.640> container<00:01:37.000> in

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
we'll in a fabric aeration container in

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.539 
we'll in a fabric aeration container in
a<00:01:37.240> smart<00:01:37.509> pot<00:01:37.719> it's<00:01:38.320> breathable<00:01:38.829> its<00:01:39.100> porous

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
a smart pot it's breathable its porous

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.580 
a smart pot it's breathable its porous
so<00:01:39.880> water<00:01:40.240> flows<00:01:40.689> through<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.170> water<00:01:41.350> moves

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
so water flows through and water moves

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.130 
so water flows through and water moves
by<00:01:41.710> capillarity<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.969> container<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.689> you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
by capillarity in the container so you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.469 
by capillarity in the container so you
have<00:01:44.469> even<00:01:45.039> water<00:01:45.310> distribution<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:46.329> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
have even water distribution in the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.170 
have even water distribution in the
container<00:01:46.899> which<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.829> tremendous<00:01:48.670> benefit

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
container which is a tremendous benefit

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.779 
container which is a tremendous benefit
in<00:01:49.509> growing<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.009> root<00:01:51.159> structure<00:01:51.549> and

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
in growing to the root structure and

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.340 
in growing to the root structure and
growing<00:01:52.030> plants<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:52.630> growing<00:01:52.810> vegetables

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
growing plants and growing vegetables

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.010 
growing plants and growing vegetables
and<00:01:53.859> so<00:01:54.130> certainly<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.909> lot<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.299> applications

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
and so certainly a lot of applications

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.779 
and so certainly a lot of applications
for<00:01:56.320> these<00:01:56.469> but<00:01:56.890> one<00:01:57.399> of<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.579> great

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
on the tenth year now after ten years

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.320 
on the tenth year now after ten years
it's<00:04:39.190> not<00:04:39.340> doesn't<00:04:39.610> quite<00:04:40.060> have<00:04:40.300> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
it's not doesn't quite have the

it's not doesn't quite have the
integrity<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.260> does<00:04:41.470> here<00:04:42.010> but<00:04:42.370> still

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
integrity that it does here but still

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.090 
integrity that it does here but still
it's<00:04:42.760> functional<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.930> works<00:04:44.170> so<00:04:44.500> yeah

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
it's functional and it works so yeah

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
know a white plastic pot would be cooler

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.960
