 sectors in the zone of the zone and which 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 we will be our efforts for 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.110

 educated pretty with a barbaján that is going 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.540
 leaving there 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.780
 Well, here we are talking with 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.170
 the Americanists already have two 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.479
 official reinforcements mine and osvaldo if already 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.790
 we are official the truth that we bring 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.720
 every week and they brought me to sunny 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.640
 the means because 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 we could not move because they were not 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.800
 closed is the truth I feel very sorry 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.960
 they talk to me and there is no news but 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.430
 already announced here that already dependencies 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 that in Paraguay he announces the light and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 paraguay that has to see fixes it 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.540
 here what of the sides was fixed up 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.850
 yesterday still with Antonio Garcia and with the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.580
 representative of osvaldo yesterday be a 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 agreement over the course of the morning and 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.430
 obviously they did travel so that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.440
 finish finishing here with your 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 representatives today in the morning with the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.560
 people from america and what about mine up to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.869
 one hour until an hour ago is the 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.150
 concrete already closed because they can be 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.470
 announce the two contracts are the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.540
 first two reinforcements of america and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.890
 Well very happy not because they are the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.750
 two options as we had as 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.400
 priority and fortunately already the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.780
 got the directed is not doing a 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.590
 great effort to put together a great 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.660
 team 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.120
 offensively I think the team is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.819
 He was looking for the best not the bugbear 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.709
 the lack of goal a little bit despite the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.480
 a lot of goals that were made and 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.459
 that you have the champion of scoring the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.069
 lack of goal at the right time not 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.260
 because whenever we say at the moment 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.190
 right is the goal the goal that will mark the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 difference in the game we make two 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.239
 very quick goals to toluca but that 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.920
 third goal that we missed we had three 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.769
 or four times we could not get it very 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.090
 clear do not breast of extremes on very 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.650
 clear three or four times and not the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.599
 we could put in and that's what we missed 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.329
 so we need a player who has 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.090
 up come to fight with pooch and with 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.860
 raul of course toning zúñiga that are 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.510
 the kids that from the quarry that are 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.370
 also fighting there raise your hand 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.890
 to start playing we are someone 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.640
 of weight there that also came to mark 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.069
 goals 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.049
 good mine this year made a great 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.230
 number of goals in your tournament 30 goals 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.060
 in 22 games it's pretty good so 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.269
 soon a different player 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.400
 martínez that the rolfi yes yes in what 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.069
 we look for what we want a game with 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.980
 much more dynamic 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.769
 and more mobility that plays more like a 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.359
 steering wheel not so tactical but that 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.760
 has a very good shot of the instance 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.650
 that has a goal pass that has a goal 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.510
 also because in spite of that it is for 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.060
 a distance helps a lot to convert 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.430
 many goals in this tournament in a 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.709
 plante does the amount that one would think 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.319
 on a flyer from that title add more 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.139
 of 10 goals or passes to blows at the end of 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.750
 accounts are coming out brown walls 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.739
 he must be sad today he talks about that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.739
 cigars of atlante 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.450
 the Monterrey plant that I do not 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.790
 touched to direct it in monterrey I do not have 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.750
 when I take it from Monterrey to the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.909
 plant because it's a very game 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.530
 interesting because the player who is 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.419
 adapted very quickly was unique not that already 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.919
 He was champion with Monterrey as you have 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.389
 said and how good there is a 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.280
 important opportunity for the plant 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.340
 to become a player from that 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.139
 characteristic and it does not always yield and 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.300
 fortunately with atlante here we could 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.550
 fulfill that that possibility 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.000
 today you are looking for a spare part that is a 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.610
 tournament that between finishing and starting 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.500
 that's very brief in the power of 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.390
 adaptation for the players that come 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.040
 from outside then we will try a player 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.600
 that comes from outside that is the dog that 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.280
 be foreign but already in the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.180
 Mexican football well adapted and not 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.500
 let us be this late possibility that the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.600
 pse is complemented with the group that are 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.220
 the level points at the end of accounts 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.780
 the case of oswaldo that hits the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.150
 ball that is a very regular game 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.140
 adapted already to the Mexican medium very young 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.060
 motivated to get to the table 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.500
 Americanist the question could be 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.540
 more blurs however there are two 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.400
 mitigating to this situation a the 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.380
 moment as you signal it is extraordinary and 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.180
 two he will find that a compatriot who 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.530
 I wrap it in every way that 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.420
 presumes that the adaptation of these two 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.370
 men to america will be very quick 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.260
 exactly we also look for that not in 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.390
 culminates again you must see the three 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.010
 front we had in the race 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.810
 we filled the payroll possible 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.900
 precisely because of knowing that with 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.210
 a mutt is already known the adaptation 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.160
 it's also going to be faster comes 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.380
 a place where you play at a certain 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.759
 then there is not much that much 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.860
 for the problem with this circumstance 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.610
 is in competition 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.740
 determines your competence is 10 12 days and 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.419
 obviously that's for us a lot 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.970
 better to know that the two are going to be 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.740
 ready in oval was that we took them out 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.660
 the pre-season already raises that even so 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.639
 there is a work week will offer 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.229
 you're going to get very well for 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:43.720
 our preseason and look look I think 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.490
 I hope they are arriving tomorrow what 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.320
 that I have not commented at the latest for 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.479
 arriving on Wednesday already directly 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.740
 proposed robot team tomorrow if they arrive 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.750
 they will even take him to do exams 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.639
 doctors and we then reach us 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.960
 he left it out a lot on Wednesday 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.729
 I will be training already with choosing 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.000
 let's hope there is contact with the 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.110
 control and another is missing because it will install 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.060
 the open doors 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.919
 only americas always have that 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.320
 possibility of while two options of 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.419
 liters on day 19 search if there are any 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.670
 interesting possibility well for 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.130
 supposed 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.570
 is to know that we are ready the other 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.640
 good news that also diego kings 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.440
 stay with us 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.440
 it's not extraordinary good news 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.390
 Diego is ready and he is ready 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.550
 compromised with me and with a directive 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.530
 be six months more here at least 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.480
 I hope to do much more but nothing 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.700
 we know that there are many cannon shots for him 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.830
 but fortunately diego kings 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.900
 will continue with the team for six months 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.850
 It gives us great pleasure and because we are 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.920
 excited how I am important 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.050
 do not give yourself good player is for your good 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.820
 well very important let's see a 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.740
 we all come back we talked about michel 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.240
 that because it has become so 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.710
 americanists 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.710
 and all this that we have
