00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
this package I'm a bit disappointed with

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.009 
this package I'm a bit disappointed with
this<00:03:09.430> figure<00:03:09.669> and<00:03:10.060> I'll<00:03:10.239> really<00:03:10.419> tell<00:03:10.689> you<00:03:10.810> why

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
this figure and I'll really tell you why

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.210 
this figure and I'll really tell you why
this<00:03:11.620> figure<00:03:12.840> doesn't<00:03:13.840> really<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.769> anything

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
this figure doesn't really have anything

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.990 
this figure doesn't really have anything
to<00:03:16.030> him<00:03:16.389> that<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.859> me<00:03:18.069> makes<00:03:18.459> me<00:03:18.700> think

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
to him that to me makes me think

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.800 
to him that to me makes me think
clocking<00:03:19.569> he's<00:03:20.349> missing<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.950> cane<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.879> clock

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
clocking he's missing the cane the clock

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.309 
clocking he's missing the cane the clock
hand<00:03:23.519> blade<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.579> guess<00:03:24.939> that<00:03:25.090> he<00:03:25.180> carries<00:03:25.569> he's

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
hand blade I guess that he carries he's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.270 
hand blade I guess that he carries he's
missing<00:03:26.799> his<00:03:26.919> Boulder<00:03:27.280> cap<00:03:27.629> or<00:03:28.629> a<00:03:29.169> hat<00:03:29.829> that<00:03:30.159> he

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
missing his Boulder cap or a hat that he

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.929 
missing his Boulder cap or a hat that he
wears<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:31.230> most<00:03:32.230> notably<00:03:32.469> he's<00:03:33.010> missing<00:03:33.519> the

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:33.939 
wears and most notably he's missing the

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.420 
wears and most notably he's missing the
the<00:03:35.280> minute<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.400> hour<00:03:36.609> hand<00:03:38.040> marks<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.250> his

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
the minute and hour hand marks on his

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.119 
the minute and hour hand marks on his
glasses<00:03:40.470> which<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.560> thought<00:03:41.709> was<00:03:41.829> really<00:03:42.010> cool

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
glasses which I thought was really cool

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.509 
glasses which I thought was really cool
in<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.609> animated<00:03:42.940> series<00:03:43.560> which<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:44.859> it

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
in the animated series which I think it

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.500 
in the animated series which I think it
was<00:03:45.699> like<00:03:45.849> three<00:03:46.060> o'clock<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.599> his<00:03:46.780> glasses

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
was like three o'clock on his glasses

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.199 
was like three o'clock on his glasses
yeah<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:50.349> course<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.010> looks<00:03:51.340> more<00:03:51.729> like<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
yeah of course this looks more like the

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.909 
yeah of course this looks more like the
clock<00:03:52.510> King<00:03:52.810> featured<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:53.530> Justice

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919

basically the the you know the guy on
the<00:04:09.189> PA<00:04:09.400> basically<00:04:09.939> he<00:04:10.090> was<00:04:10.209> telling<00:04:10.599> them<00:04:10.720> how

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
the PA basically he was telling them how

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.979 
the PA basically he was telling them how
much<00:04:10.870> time<00:04:11.290> they<00:04:11.530> had<00:04:11.909> but<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.389> clock<00:04:13.689> King

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
much time they had but that clock King

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.749 
much time they had but that clock King
didn't<00:04:14.259> have<00:04:14.470> those<00:04:14.889> marks<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.430> his<00:04:15.519> glasses

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:15.759 
didn't have those marks on his glasses

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:18.120 
didn't have those marks on his glasses
he<00:04:16.060> basically<00:04:16.359> was<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:17.199> incarnation

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
he basically was this this incarnation

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.469 
he basically was this this incarnation
of<00:04:18.220> clock<00:04:18.459> King<00:04:19.440> which<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.650> fine<00:04:21.039> but<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
of clock King which is fine but the

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.240 
of clock King which is fine but the
issue<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.990> I<00:04:23.020> really<00:04:23.409> have<00:04:23.590> is<00:04:23.800> if<00:04:23.949> they're

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
issue that I really have is if they're

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.070 
issue that I really have is if they're
releasing<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.849> as<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> matted<00:04:25.720> collector

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
releasing this as a matted collector

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.580 
releasing this as a matted collector

half<00:05:45.640> task<00:05:45.880> force<00:05:46.150> acts<00:05:46.420> but<00:05:47.290> again<00:05:47.590> if<00:05:47.800> they

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
half task force acts but again if they

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.880 
half task force acts but again if they
were<00:05:47.950> gonna<00:05:48.130> release<00:05:48.400> this<00:05:48.760> as<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:48.970> Gotham

that they re released this figure is

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.170 
that they re released this figure is
probably<00:06:14.500> really<00:06:14.950> not<00:06:15.190> much<00:06:15.400> involved<00:06:15.970> to<00:06:16.060> it

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180

though<00:06:35.220> I'm<00:06:36.220> gonna<00:06:36.310> have<00:06:36.490> to<00:06:36.550> give<00:06:36.670> him

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
though I'm gonna have to give him

probably<00:06:37.030> about<00:06:37.120> a<00:06:37.180> 4.5<00:06:37.930> and<00:06:40.230> he<00:06:41.230> is<00:06:41.380> nice<00:06:41.650> but

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040

been<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.710> lot<00:06:44.890> better<00:06:45.210> but<00:06:46.210> that<00:06:46.240> concludes<00:06:46.750> a
