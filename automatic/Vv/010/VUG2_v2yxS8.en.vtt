you<00:00:31.590> build<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> plane<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> once<00:00:33.510> you

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you build it on the plane and once you

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.299 
you build it on the plane and once you
do<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.680> go<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
bridge and once you do those three times

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
bridge and once you do those three times
you<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.610> obviously<00:00:38.790> probably<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.510> an

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
achievement for completing the tackle

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
achievement for completing the tackle
