00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.460
 I have is my heart ' you control the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.409
 ancestors of the good forest it turns out that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.600
 there was a magic tree that all love 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.909
 all the happiness of the spiral tree 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.369

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.729
 tree is separated from the forest and all the 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.950
 world gets out of control and everything goes to the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.060

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.119
 little creatures of the forest 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.110
 is to return to normal by giving the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.119
 transits that you have found 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.119

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.180
 that nobody really expected is because 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.770
 the history is too good 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.730
 besides that the soundtrack is beautiful 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.480
 just listen to the 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.040

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.260
 that there is no shit in dialogue 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.690

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.800
 cry because it's a beautiful game with 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.800

 is the way to control the 2d environment 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.620
 and spin what creates a confusion wey 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.959
 trust me want want want

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.860
 you really have to look for days in

 click wikipedia because they are impossible 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.910
 really impossible music is not 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.730
 too much egypt which takes away a 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.560
 little of the retro style but the same is 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.680
 very good music is without a doubt 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.380
 the best retro puzzle games I say 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.150
 what better than those who have spoken in all 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.150

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.930
 number 1 to egg 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.650
 no doubt this game coming to the 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.350
 put number one because they have it from 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.470
 everything from the best easy puzzles 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.449
 but the time like that make you think 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.970
 from a very good horror story 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.310
 psychological creating those graphics 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.990
 Colleagues have terror the system of 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.250
 immersion is the best they have seen or 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.759
 at least the best I've seen in my 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.110
 life and especially the music that also 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.390
 is very good help the system of 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.460
 immersion 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.470
 the story is about a friend of yours 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.270
