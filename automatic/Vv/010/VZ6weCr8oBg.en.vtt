00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.120
 good today I bring you a video so that 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.360
 you learn a little bit the concepts 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.010
 basic to be able to draw manga because 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.990
 good to start some females 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.820
 they had asked for a long time ago and good as 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.279
 yesterday I study giving as classes between 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.860
 quotes so fixed good so I'm going to 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.020
 put here to make a video and good you 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.790
 I'm going to make some drawings a 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.490
 boy and a girl in this case the adult 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.650
 and sakura that you already know them 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.560
 I suppose we go and so you know 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.140
 basically the things that the 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.250
 guys and the girls in the take that I got 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 low and good I'll start here and now 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.300
 with naruto and good to see what came out was 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.300
 explaining vale 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 ok as you can see I start here doing the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 face that I'm going to make a close-up 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.690
 of the two characters so yes so that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 be easier for those who start and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.300
 well the first thing is to do the outline 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.190
 impart face 4 basically and good 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.050
 in one of the most difficult things is 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.000
 that is 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.490
 the bottom part of the face and there are three 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.830
 basic points and bone if you know 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.080
 these this is that I'm checking here if 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.200
 you know what they are, it will be good for you 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.690
 because they are like three points that if you know 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.920
 do them because they are like where you bend 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.860
 to create the chin because it is already 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.869
 and well here I keep making my face 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.869
 I also frame the eyes frame a height 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.299
 for for both you know so that the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.100
 two equal and good can also be 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.119
 use the pencil to measure so that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.830
 stay more more more better 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.380
 and so that the measure is the same 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.840
 then regarding the nose the both or 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.399
 both eyes and well you have to have a lot 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.400
 Be careful also with the measures between 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.010
 the eyes the mouth and the chin and the mouth 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.209
 because if you do not do it well then the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.209
 I do not have to give a character 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.250
 yes 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.220
 expedition has 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 I'm not going to make it so detailed 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.319
 drawing because if not we will not end like this 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 what a good thing I leave that is to edit and good 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.980
 I'm doing with a normal pencil 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 because it will be the one that you will have the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.250
 mostly at home 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.569
 and neither do I know where my 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.390
 trout and that we could not with the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.780
 soft and good 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.390
 Now I'm with my chin and yes because 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.400
 always the same it always ends 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.680
 is playing a bit from the beginning 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.050
 up to now good a little bit sometimes 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.810
 pretty but good you already realize 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.170
 of how it is going well and such and if the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.040
 you have to retouch or not and well, the 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.420
 chin I think that is what defines 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.239
 practically if it's going to look good or 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.440
 not the character in brackish miami ochoa and 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 good here the eyes have to have 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.640
 careful also because here it has come 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.280
 a little bit and one is looking a bit to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.350
 one on one side and another for another and a little 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.590
 bigger but good that's already fixed 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.250
 the new and such good that they are in mourning 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.989
 Well I hope that I have served you to see 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.660
 then the differences between 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.610
 the tall and sakura so you know how to 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.500
 the differences between the face of a 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:06.010
 boy and the other of a girl and good 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.830
 well here in the eyes what 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.189
 I had to be careful here and cal with 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.409
 the measures because what was done before 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.870
 the measurements are that I'm marking 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.570
 well, that is, they are going to be what they define 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.640
 the character is well done or not 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.320
 and here to tell you a little bit that you have 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.690
 be careful with the neck and such because it is a 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.850
 angle seen with a little bit from above and 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.580
 by not facing the neck 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.160
 starts at the top of the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.080
 face and is and good also with the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.730
 chin that is like that is a little 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.500
 wide for being a boy and well what 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.500
 you will see with the difference of sakura and such 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.490
 at the beginning to create that is both the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.480
 Chico boy is basically the same 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.070
 make the face and match in four and 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.080
 well you see what I'm doing here 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.210
 cure with the face much more finite or 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.040
 be what a girl would normally be like 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.590
 let's go and well here I'll start before 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.760
 because of his hair because he is a bald adult 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.760
 what I did at the beginning 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.130
 well now I put my eyes and I do 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.740
 the same measure from here over there so that 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.440
 is basically the same as the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.970
 eyes and such good in principle always 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.040
 they will come out a little different but 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.240
 then I go matching them up a bit but 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.740
 it's also that you're going to see that it's not going to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.480
 be absolutely the same and neither 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.800
 you have to despair about that 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.470
 even people love you eyes 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.060
 the same thing you do have to know is 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.700
 when I say it 's a little bit it's a little bit 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.430
 of anatomy and such because to know the 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.150
 measures because measured effects that is not 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.390
 you know so be careful 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.480
 and now here I am in I'm doing more 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.310
 fine the face still still because good 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.700
 that also as I said before or barreto 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.700
 cando 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.159
 well here I am more or less 

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:14.990
 reviewing everything and good things that more 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.760
 would bring them to this drawing because we are going to 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.250
 be a little 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.860
 the chin and just like the other drawings 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.860
 retouch it and good also here the mouth 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.020
 because sometimes girls have their mouths 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.890
 smaller than the boys and well there 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.890
 to retouch a little 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:05.029
 well here I finish the drawing of sakura 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.939
 here with some final touches shadows and 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:10.300
 blablabla and good when I finish I'll 

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:12.589
 proceed to compare the boys and girls 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.439
 in the differences between these 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:17.499
 Manga and good characters that are 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:20.449
 some enough and such when we start 

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:22.759
 Here we have Naruto and this cure is not 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.559
 is to put on his perfect gray and 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:25.789
 good eyes fixed on the eyes of the 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:27.110
 guys are usually smaller and 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.779
 lengthened what can be that some 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.460
 male characters if they are so very 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.740
 cheerful and with a lot of energy because the 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.599
 They tend to have quite large but good 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.249
 in general those of the girls have them 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:39.639
 bigger and the mouths of the boys 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:41.409
 It is also usually bigger 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.960
 and well we can also see some 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:45.610
 differences that would also be fixed in 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.169
 the chin what elements of the guys 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.409
 they are much wider and that of the girls 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:52.300
 is much finer and the mouth of the 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.909
 girls as I said before is smaller and 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.590
 good eyes what it says that the 

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:59.770
 Girls do not usually have bigger but 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.539
 there are some guys that is not good that 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.370
 they have basically the thinnest face 

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:05.620
 girls and boys a little bit wider 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.330
 it also depends a lot on the character 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.759
 because not all are equal but good 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.620
 these would be basically the general 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.539
 I hope you liked it and you can 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.340
 subscribe and like and all those 

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:18.330
 things and if you want more you just have to 

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.330
 tell me the chao
