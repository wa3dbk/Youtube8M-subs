00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
blouse was gold too when I think there

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
blouse was gold too when I think there
was<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> bit<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> an<00:00:40.469> overload<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> gold<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.700> she

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
was a bit of an overload of gold and she

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
was a bit of an overload of gold and she
had<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> hideous<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.559> large<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> which

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
had a hideous really large up to which

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
had a hideous really large up to which
really<00:00:45.239> didn't<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.719> anything<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> look

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
really didn't do anything for the look

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
really didn't do anything for the look
so<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.370> look<00:00:47.789> was<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> complete<00:00:48.390> no

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
so I think that look was a complete no

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
so I think that look was a complete no
no<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.020> sure<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.890> second<00:00:50.250> side<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
no for sure the second side he was a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.880 
no for sure the second side he was a
sabyasachi<00:00:51.420> black<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.079> gold<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.649> thought

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
sabyasachi black and gold now I thought

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860

I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.590> her<00:01:37.740> stylist<00:01:38.220> should<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.460> advised

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I think her stylist should have advised

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.300 
I think her stylist should have advised
her<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.210> better<00:01:39.540> lingerie<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.500> sure<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
her on better lingerie for sure also the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
her on better lingerie for sure also the
Prada<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.880> structured<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.110> was

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Prada really structured up to which was

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
Prada really structured up to which was
really<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> stock<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.549> top<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> her<00:01:45.000> head

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
really a stock on the top of her head

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
really a stock on the top of her head
which<00:01:45.780> again<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.320> didn't<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.100> work

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
which again I think didn't really work

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
which again I think didn't really work
with<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> dress<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.540> worked<00:01:48.750> was

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
with the dress what really worked was

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
with the dress what really worked was
