00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:10.080
 good we have this samsung to 10 85 on 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.429
 10 86 is a low-end cell phone that I want 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 do this explanation because it is very 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 simple and many times we can 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 confuse when we make the call the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.359
 phone does not work in the mode 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.730
 handset but when we activate the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.730
 speaker then if it works 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 but when we give him headset then 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.950
 it does not work not like that we add the volume not 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.680
 will work and the solution is very 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.850
 easy to be practiced many times 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.199
 on this phone 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.519
 and in other low range as some x coffee 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:52.180
 105 105 some x that also have 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.370
 suffer from ceim or problems that work 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.710
 the timbres sometimes the speaker but not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.659
 the headset works and like these 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.729
 cell phones showing headset 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.120
 independent but the headset is 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:08.290
 the same speaker does the same function 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.230
 We see here 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.480
 the same handset is the same speaker or 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.550
 the same speaker and here we are going to 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.050
 learn something in this case in this 10 86 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.010
 then he connects there as 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.910
 come 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.490
 and then go to these circuits here this 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.370
 line then comes here to one as the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.410
 resistance or some this a resistance 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.450
 of 0 niasse then these two 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.880
 capacitors from here to here has 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.280
 continuity and the capacitor pse sometimes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800
 bring hates here attention suppressors 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 that one removes them at some moments and 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.470
 they work but then this one in this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.390
 case everything was fine the speaker is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.920
 well because if it works by a line 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.110
 means that the other one is 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.870
 Failing then what we are going to do 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.700
 the next good thing I'm going to finish 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.440
 do the explanation this circuit that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.530
 we see here an integrated circuit that 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.520
 it has to do with this the functioning 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.200
 of the audio and activates the speaker or active 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.150
 to the headset also when it enters 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 free humans then has the function 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.190
 as a switch disable the audio the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.709
 lair to enable the audio brothers 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.600
 free then almost always in this 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.090
 circuit we're just going to apply 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.980
 fluxÃ¡ around we will reinforce it with 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.519
 the heat station 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.800
 with the mouthpiece it can be number 3 we go 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.440
 to 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.150
 to give heat on here I'm alone 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.640
 doing the simulation is the explanation 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.800
 since I already did it and we will be 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.440
 touching the circuit this we will do a 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.200
 temperature of 300 350 degrees with a 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.090
 level more or less than 3 air and we're going 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.460
 touching the circuit when you move a 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.820
 little tin is already melted down 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.440
 already resulted and we would have solution in 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.990
 case such that we do the if not 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.750
 let's have a solution before we should 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.730
 have tested the continuity none of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.190
 these two points can give continuity to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.990
 land if it already contains a land can 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.330
 be given is henceforth already 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.610
 he has it ripped out he does not have to 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.220
 when it is on earth then they do 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.380
 that the circuit does not work here 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.240
 we see that it has to continue here after 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 of the circuit goes to the other side then to 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.900
 capacitor and then passes this point that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.030
 see here 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.790
 to these circuits and also has 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:30.840
 continuity to point number 5 of the weekend 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.879
 The cargo order can be either the peru sb 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.239
 this circuit is the one that controls and 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.200
 the one that makes all this function 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.200
 we are going to release it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.690
 let's solder the speaker that 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:47.900
 exponent to do the test 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.700
 since we remember that the speakers give 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.490
 continuity and then being 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.640
 connected would give me one more reading in 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.280
 the continuity test is because I 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.500
 it would sound on both sides because if something 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.500
 but continuing on the two points would give 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.230
 let's assemble it and let's see what 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.770
 if the headset and the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.770
 talking 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.590
 simple some more asked the 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.269
 channel then I took advantage that this came 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.099
 case 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.099
 to be able to do that explanation 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.000
 let's try it 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.780
 and fast before the caravan passes 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.409
 is that the celebration caravan pays 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.129
 of our final natal classification 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.129
 there we see 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.020
 and here we see then running the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.860
 handset 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.800
 perfectly after having resulted 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.930
 is the circuit in many dollars that on 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.600
 low range that have the same function the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.310
 same handset the same speaker happens 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.490
 much this that by a blow or by 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.520
 humidity the circuit is blocking the 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.130
 audio signals and do not allow and generate 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.870
 this kind of error that by loudspeaker and 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.790
 but by handset not service of
