00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.140 

okay<00:00:02.040> so<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.250> put<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.870> put<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.950> axial<00:00:04.950> dig<00:00:05.220> in

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
okay so I put the put the axial dig in

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.020 
okay so I put the put the axial dig in
the<00:00:06.569> Wraiths<00:00:06.750> yesterday<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.799> hooked<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.940> up

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the Wraiths yesterday and hooked it up

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.419 
the Wraiths yesterday and hooked it up
to<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.210> spectrum<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.990> had<00:00:10.170> why<00:00:10.679> off<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.340> my

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
to my spectrum I had why off one of my

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.079 
to my spectrum I had why off one of my
ports<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.179> my<00:00:12.509> lights<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.160> IBEC<00:00:14.160> go<00:00:14.639> into<00:00:14.910> one

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
ports so my lights and IBEC go into one

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
ports so my lights and IBEC go into one
port<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.859> using<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.449> third<00:00:18.449> channel<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
port and using the third channel for the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.010 
port and using the third channel for the
dig<00:00:19.350> figured<00:00:19.949> I'd<00:00:20.070> get<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.340> show<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.520> guys<00:00:21.020> how

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
dig figured I'd get to show you guys how

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.920 
dig figured I'd get to show you guys how
it<00:00:22.170> works<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:23.039> turns<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:24.060> really

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it works it actually turns really really

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.710 
it works it actually turns really really
good<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> let's<00:00:26.369> check<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.480> my

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
good so let's check it out I have my

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.759 
good so let's check it out I have my
controller<00:00:30.109> yeah<00:00:31.109> there<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.439> go

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
controller yeah there we go

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:46.240 
controller yeah there we go
that's<00:00:32.279> e<00:00:32.430> Morse<00:00:34.190> okay<00:00:35.660> so<00:00:43.670> using<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> dig<00:00:45.059> kit

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
that's e Morse okay so using the dig kit

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.080 
that's e Morse okay so using the dig kit
high-tech<00:00:47.250> 79<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> 79<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:51.170> HS<00:00:52.399> 255<00:00:53.399> ng<00:00:53.879> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
high-tech 79 or not a 79 the HS 255 ng I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.889 
high-tech 79 or not a 79 the HS 255 ng I
think<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.989> 225<00:00:55.590> mg<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:59.640> little<00:00:59.940> guy<00:01:00.030> they

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
think the 225 mg that little guy they

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
think the 225 mg that little guy they
have<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> tendency<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.649> strip<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.550> motors<00:01:02.850> very

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
have a tendency to strip the motors very

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
have a tendency to strip the motors very
easily<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.080> end<00:01:04.229> point<00:01:04.409> 2<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> 4<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.280> when

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
easily if your end point 2 to 4 so when

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.649 
easily if your end point 2 to 4 so when
you<00:01:05.519> go<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> set<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you go to set this up

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
you go to set this up
turn<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.930> endpoints<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:09.030> down

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
turn your endpoints way way way down

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
turn your endpoints way way way down
before<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> start<00:01:10.200> setting<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
before you start setting up because you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
before you start setting up because you
could<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> burn<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.240> servo<00:01:12.810> really

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
could just burn out that servo really

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
could just burn out that servo really
quick<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> burned<00:01:14.100> out<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.490> three<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.119> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
quick I burned out like three of them on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.340 
quick I burned out like three of them on
my<00:01:15.270> LCC<00:01:15.960> dig<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.420> my<00:01:18.780> highside<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
my LCC dig so on my highside and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
my LCC dig so on my highside and
low-side<00:01:19.530> I'm<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:19.979> 31<00:01:20.400> percent<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.970> each<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.509> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
low-side I'm at 31 percent on each so I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
low-side I'm at 31 percent on each so I
should<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.080> taken<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.500> pictures<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
should have taken some pictures but you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.330 
should have taken some pictures but you
could<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> there

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.160 

it's<00:01:36.940> kind<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.210> hard<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.540> see<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.630> see<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:41.020> arm

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's kind of hard to see you see the arm

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.499 
it's kind of hard to see you see the arm
for<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.740> had<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.700> slide<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.119> motor<00:01:43.270> over<00:01:45.509> port

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
for it had to slide the motor over port

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.570 
for it had to slide the motor over port
the<00:01:46.750> solder<00:01:47.380> tabs<00:01:47.710> they<00:01:48.009> had<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.190> go<00:01:48.280> straight

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
the solder tabs they had to go straight

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.859 
the solder tabs they had to go straight
up<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:52.649> dremel<00:01:53.649> doubt<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:54.690> little<00:01:55.690> bit

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
up and see a dremel doubt a little bit

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.210 
up and see a dremel doubt a little bit
of<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.080> interior<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.770> make<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.040> fit<00:01:58.830> but<00:01:59.830> it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
of the interior to make it fit but it's

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.100 
of the interior to make it fit but it's
not<00:02:00.399> too<00:02:00.610> noticeable<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:01.299> it's<00:02:01.509> pretty<00:02:01.659> cool

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
not too noticeable so it's pretty cool

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.249 
not too noticeable so it's pretty cool

bambam say a little bit man Hey so let's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:39.790 
bambam say a little bit man Hey so let's
power<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.140> up

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.010 

see<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> shot<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.360> servo<00:02:42.720> arm

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
see if I can get a shot of a servo arm

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:54.260 
see if I can get a shot of a servo arm
moving<00:02:44.570> move<00:02:45.570> very<00:02:46.260> very<00:02:47.540> little<00:02:48.540> movement<00:02:53.270> if

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
moving move very very little movement if

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.700 
moving move very very little movement if
you<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> three-position<00:02:55.200> which<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.650> don't

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
you have a three-position which I don't

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.170 
you have a three-position which I don't
I<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> workaround<00:02:57.330> for<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.410> do

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
I have a workaround for it you can do

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.530 
I have a workaround for it you can do
you<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.330> lock<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.690> rear<00:03:00.840> wheels<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.510> can

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you can lock the rear wheels and you can

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.330 
you can lock the rear wheels and you can
free<00:03:03.990> spool<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.410> rear<00:03:04.560> wheels<00:03:04.830> but<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.190> only

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
free spool the rear wheels but I only

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.860 
free spool the rear wheels but I only
have<00:03:05.490> a<00:03:05.550> two<00:03:05.700> position<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.240> I'm<00:03:06.360> running<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.750> as

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
have a two position so I'm running it as

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.650 
have a two position so I'm running it as
a<00:03:06.900> locked<00:03:07.380> right<00:03:07.710> now<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:09.980> that's<00:03:10.980> four<00:03:11.660> four

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
a locked right now so that's four four

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:37.420 
a locked right now so that's four four
wheel

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:47.719 
a pretty big turning radius now this is

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.880 
a pretty big turning radius now this is
it<00:03:47.900> going<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.109> be<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:49.250> dig<00:03:49.459> engaged<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
it going to be the dig engaged and the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.629 
it going to be the dig engaged and the
rear<00:03:52.129> wheels<00:03:52.370> locked<00:03:56.769> pretty<00:03:57.769> much<00:03:57.980> turns<00:03:58.370> on

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
rear wheels locked pretty much turns on

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:13.479 
rear wheels locked pretty much turns on
that<00:03:59.469> that<00:04:00.469> inside<00:04:01.250> rear<00:04:01.730> wheel<00:04:12.489> four-wheel

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
that that inside rear wheel four-wheel

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:30.380 
that that inside rear wheel four-wheel
again

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:50.660 

engaged<00:04:41.550> disengaged

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.610 

there's<00:04:51.210> enough<00:04:51.420> bad<00:04:51.600> turning<00:04:51.990> radius<00:04:52.320> on<00:04:52.440> its

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
there's enough bad turning radius on its

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.240 
there's enough bad turning radius on its
own<00:04:52.770> but<00:04:53.070> with<00:04:53.970> that<00:04:54.210> dig<00:04:54.860> makes<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> lot

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
own but with that dig makes it a lot

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.350 
own but with that dig makes it a lot
better<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.610> then<00:05:00.180> so<00:05:00.810> what<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.160> to<00:05:02.360> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
better and then so what I do to the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.960 
better and then so what I do to the
workaround<00:05:03.930> if<00:05:04.140> I<00:05:04.260> want<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.770> free<00:05:05.520> spin<00:05:05.790> the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
workaround if I want to free spin the

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.950 
workaround if I want to free spin the
rear<00:05:06.150> wheels<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:06.750> don't<00:05:07.470> want<00:05:07.620> my<00:05:07.680> controller

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.980 

engage<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.200> dig<00:05:13.440> well<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:14.570> leave<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.720> on<00:05:15.810> this

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
engage the dig well I leave it on this

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.700 
engage the dig well I leave it on this
screen<00:05:16.350> on<00:05:16.710> my<00:05:17.610> my<00:05:18.210> servo<00:05:18.510> travel<00:05:18.900> screen<00:05:19.170> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
screen on my my servo travel screen and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.700 
screen on my my servo travel screen and
then<00:05:20.250> I<00:05:20.370> engage<00:05:20.730> the<00:05:20.910> dig<00:05:21.150> and<00:05:21.570> then<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.500> turn

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
then I engage the dig and then I turn

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.550 
then I engage the dig and then I turn
this<00:05:22.890> down<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.400> zero<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.940> now<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:28.230> dig<00:05:28.440> is

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
this down to zero and now the dig is

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.200 
this down to zero and now the dig is
engaged<00:05:29.810> but<00:05:30.810> my<00:05:31.020> rip<00:05:31.230> my<00:05:31.620> rear<00:05:31.830> tires<00:05:32.210> are

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
engaged but my rip my rear tires are

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.080 
engaged but my rip my rear tires are
free<00:05:33.540> spooled<00:05:33.840> as<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.830> see<00:05:35.010> watch<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.790> front

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
free spooled as you see watch the front

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.680 
free spooled as you see watch the front
wheel<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:37.680> they<00:05:37.890> spin<00:05:38.190> you're<00:05:39.060> turning<00:05:39.390> radius

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
wheel so they spin you're turning radius

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.930 
wheel so they spin you're turning radius
isn't<00:05:39.960> as<00:05:40.050> good<00:05:40.230> as<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:40.980> but<00:05:41.370> I<00:05:41.400> mean<00:05:41.700> if

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
isn't as good as this but I mean if

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.330 
isn't as good as this but I mean if
you're<00:05:42.510> on<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.720> climb<00:05:43.110> if<00:05:43.380> you're<00:05:43.560> on<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.710> cliff

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
you're on a climb if you're on a cliff

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.210 
you're on a climb if you're on a cliff
and<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:45.750> don't<00:05:46.110> want<00:05:46.320> power<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.830> those<00:05:46.980> rear

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
and you don't want power to those rear

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.880 
and you don't want power to those rear
wheels<00:05:47.720> because<00:05:48.720> they<00:05:48.780> dig<00:05:49.140> in<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.560> they<00:05:49.650> flip

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
wheels because they dig in and they flip

00:05:49.890 --> 00:06:01.640 
wheels because they dig in and they flip
you<00:05:50.010> over<00:05:50.810> that'll<00:05:51.810> come<00:05:52.020> in<00:05:52.050> handy

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.939 

and<00:06:02.650> then<00:06:02.800> when<00:06:03.279> I<00:06:03.310> want<00:06:03.490> to<00:06:03.610> go<00:06:03.729> back<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:04.949> full

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:05.949 
and then when I want to go back to full

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:15.360 
and then when I want to go back to full
lock<00:06:06.990> back<00:06:07.990> up<00:06:08.199> to<00:06:08.349> my<00:06:08.469> 31%<00:06:09.460> and<00:06:11.789> then<00:06:12.789> my<00:06:14.370> rear

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
lock back up to my 31% and then my rear

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.239 
lock back up to my 31% and then my rear
tire<00:06:15.610> is<00:06:15.639> lost<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:17.650> they<00:06:17.770> turn<00:06:17.949> on<00:06:18.129> a<00:06:18.159> dime

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:18.249 
tire is lost and they turn on a dime

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:21.390 
tire is lost and they turn on a dime
again<00:06:18.699> pretty<00:06:19.449> cool<00:06:20.219> cost

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
again pretty cool cost

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.779 
again pretty cool cost
I<00:06:21.819> think<00:06:22.150> the<00:06:22.210> dig<00:06:22.419> is<00:06:22.919> I'll<00:06:23.919> post<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.550> picture

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
I think the dig is I'll post the picture

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.610 
I think the dig is I'll post the picture
up<00:06:24.879> with<00:06:24.999> the<00:06:25.120> video<00:06:25.469> it's<00:06:26.469> like<00:06:26.590> 36<00:06:26.889> bucks<00:06:28.620> the

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
up with the video it's like 36 bucks the

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:35.779 
up with the video it's like 36 bucks the
high<00:06:29.919> Tech's<00:06:30.189> the<00:06:31.169> 225<00:06:32.169> mg<00:06:32.500> is<00:06:33.509> like<00:06:34.509> 30<00:06:34.779> bucks

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
high Tech's the 225 mg is like 30 bucks

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.360 
high Tech's the 225 mg is like 30 bucks
and<00:06:36.789> then<00:06:37.689> if<00:06:37.840> you<00:06:38.050> have<00:06:38.409> limited<00:06:38.650> ports<00:06:39.189> on

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
and then if you have limited ports on

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.640 
and then if you have limited ports on
your<00:06:39.689> receiver<00:06:40.689> as<00:06:40.840> I<00:06:40.990> do<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.319> got<00:06:41.439> to<00:06:41.529> get<00:06:41.620> a
