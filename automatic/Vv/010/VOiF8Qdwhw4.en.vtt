00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
gel kit which includes the diffusion a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.490 
gel kit which includes the diffusion a
purple<00:00:55.620> magenta<00:00:55.860> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.670> gel<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.930> thicker

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
purple magenta kind of gel and a thicker

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
purple magenta kind of gel and a thicker
diffusion<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> we'll<00:01:00.780> thought<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.020> over

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
diffusion so we'll thought that over

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
diffusion so we'll thought that over
there<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.530> right<00:01:01.649> now<00:01:01.820> these<00:01:02.820> lights<00:01:03.090> are

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
there for right now these lights are

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.380 
there for right now these lights are
made<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> durable<00:01:04.589> plastic<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.180> back

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
made out of durable plastic in the back

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.399 
made out of durable plastic in the back
here<00:01:06.780> even<00:01:07.560> though<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.150> barn<00:01:09.150> doors<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.930> our

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
here even though the barn doors are our

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.859 
here even though the barn doors are our
metal<00:01:10.790> like<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> said<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.270> come<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
metal like I said they come with a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.429 
metal like I said they come with a
diffusion<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.570> as<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.290> are

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
diffusion and as you can see there are

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.660 
diffusion and as you can see there are
600<00:01:17.430> LED<00:01:18.360> lights<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> good<00:01:20.520> thing

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
600 LED lights here and the good thing

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
600 LED lights here and the good thing
about<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.750> by<00:01:22.020> color<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.159> do

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
about this is it's by color so I can do

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.840 
about this is it's by color so I can do
either<00:01:23.780> daylight<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.110> i<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.950> tungsten<00:01:26.549> or

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
either daylight or i can do tungsten or

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.230 
either daylight or i can do tungsten or
indoor<00:01:27.420> light<00:01:28.340> that's<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.790> reason<00:01:30.090> why<00:01:30.119> i

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
indoor light that's the reason why i

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.080 
indoor light that's the reason why i
bought<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.960> was<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.680> me

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
bought these I was like it would make me

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
bought these I was like it would make me
make<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> equipment<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.780> versatile<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
make the equipment very versatile that I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.080 
make the equipment very versatile that I
would<00:01:34.890> only<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.670> certain<00:01:36.060> amount

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
would only have to take a certain amount

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.289 
would only have to take a certain amount
of<00:01:36.329> equipment<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.900> me<00:01:37.079> when<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.740> doing<00:01:37.920> my

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
of equipment with me when I'm doing my

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
of equipment with me when I'm doing my
shooting<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.409> mostly<00:01:40.710> use<00:01:40.920> these

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
shooting and I would mostly use these

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270 
shooting and I would mostly use these
for<00:01:41.369> interviews<00:01:42.110> because<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.799> LED

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
for interviews because you know as LED

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
for interviews because you know as LED
lights<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:45.000> don't<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> huge<00:01:45.630> throw<00:01:46.049> like

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
lights they don't have a huge throw like

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
lights they don't have a huge throw like
a<00:01:47.270> omnia<00:01:48.270> light<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:48.840> could<00:01:49.110> probably

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
a omnia light that i could probably

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.670 
a omnia light that i could probably
light<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> whole<00:01:50.540> room<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.500> these

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
light up the whole room with but these

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
light up the whole room with but these
are<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.369> intimate<00:01:53.850> interview<00:01:54.780> lights

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
are more for intimate interview lights

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
are more for intimate interview lights
