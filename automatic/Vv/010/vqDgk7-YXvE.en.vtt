this<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.880> grape<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> minute<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.320> want

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this is a grape but for a minute I want

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
this is a grape but for a minute I want
you<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> imagine<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.520> eyeball<00:02:02.969> if

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
you to imagine this is your eyeball if

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
you to imagine this is your eyeball if
that<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.110> eyeball<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> your

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
that is your eyeball then this is your

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.370 
that is your eyeball then this is your
eyeball<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> look<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> Sun<00:02:07.049> through<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
eyeball if you look at the Sun through a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.310 
eyeball if you look at the Sun through a
regular<00:02:07.680> telescope

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.040 

so<00:02:12.320> tell<00:02:12.860> me<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:13.970> safe<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.480> look<00:02:14.630> at<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> Sun

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
so tell me is it safe to look at the Sun

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.010 
so tell me is it safe to look at the Sun
through<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.350> telescope<00:02:16.570> there<00:02:17.570> are<00:02:17.750> several

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
through a telescope there are several

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.750 
through a telescope there are several
ways<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.410> look<00:02:18.500> at<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.680> Sun<00:02:18.860> safely<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.580> way

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
ways to look at the Sun safely one way

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.310 
ways to look at the Sun safely one way
is<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.210> use<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.360> special<00:02:20.900> filter

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
is to use a special filter

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.170 
is to use a special filter
it's<00:02:21.620> called<00:02:21.860> welders<00:02:22.580> goggle<00:02:23.170> 14<00:02:25.060> looks<00:02:26.060> like

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
it's called welders goggle 14 looks like

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.180 
it's called welders goggle 14 looks like
a<00:02:26.210> little<00:02:26.420> light<00:02:26.630> bulb<00:02:26.900> okay<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.010> also

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
a little light bulb okay you can also

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.300 
a little light bulb okay you can also
project<00:02:32.060> images<00:02:32.780> at<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.020> Sun<00:02:33.260> safely<00:02:33.830> okay

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
project images at the Sun safely okay

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.650 
project images at the Sun safely okay
what<00:02:34.550> actually<00:02:34.820> happens<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.270> here<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.480> light

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
what actually happens in here the light

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.170 
what actually happens in here the light
comes<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.110> through<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.380> big<00:02:36.530> lens<00:02:36.910> there<00:02:37.910> are

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
comes in through the big lens there are

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.150 
comes in through the big lens there are
mirrors<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:39.050> here<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> light<00:02:39.680> bounces

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
mirrors in here that the light bounces

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.700 
mirrors in here that the light bounces
around<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> mirror<00:02:41.000> at<00:02:41.690> every<00:02:42.080> corner<00:02:42.410> of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
around as a mirror at every corner of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.410 
around as a mirror at every corner of
the<00:02:42.800> triangle<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.760> bounces<00:02:44.210> bounces

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the triangle and it bounces bounces

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.870 
the triangle and it bounces bounces
bounces<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.320> bounces<00:02:46.130> down<00:02:46.340> through<00:02:46.730> the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
bounces and bounces down through the

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.720 
bounces and bounces down through the
eyepiece<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.860> then<00:02:48.860> we<00:02:49.070> just<00:02:49.250> let<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> light

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
eyepiece and then we just let the light

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.970 
eyepiece and then we just let the light
shine<00:02:50.030> down<00:02:50.660> on<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:51.110> piece<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.350> paper<00:02:51.590> and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
shine down on this piece of paper and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.280 
shine down on this piece of paper and
we'll<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.150> an<00:02:53.270> image<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> Sun<00:02:53.900> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
we'll have an image of the Sun the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.290 
we'll have an image of the Sun the
telescope<00:02:54.740> has<00:02:54.860> been<00:02:54.980> around<00:02:55.190> for<00:02:55.490> 400<00:02:56.120> years

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
telescope has been around for 400 years

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.990 
telescope has been around for 400 years
and<00:02:56.740> back<00:02:57.740> when<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.010> was<00:02:58.040> first<00:02:58.370> made<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.610> man

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
and back when it was first made a man

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.670 
and back when it was first made a man
named<00:02:59.210> Galileo<00:02:59.390> he<00:03:00.110> heard<00:03:00.350> about<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
named Galileo he heard about the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.930 
named Galileo he heard about the
invention<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.190> telescope<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.730> then<00:03:01.880> he

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
invention of the telescope and then he

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940 
invention of the telescope and then he
quickly<00:03:02.180> made<00:03:02.420> his<00:03:02.600> own<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.440> he<00:03:03.620> was<00:03:03.740> one<00:03:03.860> of

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
quickly made his own and he was one of

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.650 
quickly made his own and he was one of
the<00:03:04.010> first<00:03:04.160> people<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.550> actually<00:03:04.760> pointed<00:03:05.570> at

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
the first people to actually pointed at

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.390 
the first people to actually pointed at
things<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.080> sky<00:03:06.410> he<00:03:06.770> looked<00:03:06.950> at<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> moon

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
things in the sky he looked at the moon

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.580 
things in the sky he looked at the moon
he<00:03:07.790> looked<00:03:08.000> at<00:03:08.120> Jupiter<00:03:08.690> he<00:03:08.810> looked<00:03:09.020> at<00:03:09.110> Saturn

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
he looked at Jupiter he looked at Saturn

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.010 
he looked at Jupiter he looked at Saturn
he<00:03:09.680> looked<00:03:09.860> at<00:03:09.980> Venus<00:03:10.370> he<00:03:11.210> also<00:03:11.390> looked<00:03:11.780> at<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
he looked at Venus he also looked at the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.350 
he looked at Venus he also looked at the
Sun<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:13.040> much<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.370> same<00:03:13.580> way<00:03:13.940> we're<00:03:14.120> doing

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
Sun in much the same way we're doing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.040 
Sun in much the same way we're doing
right<00:03:14.480> now

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
right now

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.510 
right now
he<00:03:15.350> didn't<00:03:15.590> look<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:16.040> through<00:03:16.310> the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
he didn't look right through the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.190 
he didn't look right through the
telescope<00:03:17.060> he<00:03:17.480> didn't<00:03:17.660> put<00:03:17.780> his<00:03:17.810> eye<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.050> the

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
telescope he didn't put his eye to the

telescope he didn't put his eye to the
eyepiece<00:03:18.590> he<00:03:19.160> let<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.460> light<00:03:19.640> shine<00:03:19.670> out<00:03:20.060> onto

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
eyepiece he let the light shine out onto

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.020 
eyepiece he let the light shine out onto
a<00:03:20.810> piece<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.170> paper<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.280> he<00:03:22.460> saw<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.640> picture<00:03:22.910> of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
a piece of paper and he saw a picture of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.460 
a piece of paper and he saw a picture of
the<00:03:23.120> Sun<00:03:23.420> pretty<00:03:23.780> much<00:03:23.990> like<00:03:24.200> what<00:03:24.350> you're

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
the Sun pretty much like what you're

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.630

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
get a little spot of light isn't it well

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.080 
get a little spot of light isn't it well
actually<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.770> spot<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.220> light<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.610> an<00:03:40.850> image

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
actually that spot of light is an image

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.690 
actually that spot of light is an image
of<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.300> Sun<00:03:41.540> if<00:03:41.990> you<00:03:42.230> take<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.980> hole<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.460> paper

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
of the Sun if you take the hole in paper

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.600 
of the Sun if you take the hole in paper
and<00:03:44.000> let<00:03:44.930> light<00:03:45.140> shine<00:03:45.440> through<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.740> to<00:03:46.460> let

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
and let light shine through it to let

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.310 
and let light shine through it to let
that<00:03:46.730> light<00:03:46.970> fall<00:03:47.270> onto<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.600> piece<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:47.840> paper<00:03:47.960> on

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
that light fall onto a piece of paper on

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.020 
that light fall onto a piece of paper on
the<00:03:48.410> other<00:03:48.440> side<00:03:48.770> you<00:03:49.370> can<00:03:49.400> make<00:03:49.730> an<00:03:49.850> image

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
the other side you can make an image

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.480 
the other side you can make an image
this<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.630> called<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:50.870> pinhole<00:03:51.200> camera<00:03:51.370> now<00:03:52.370> what

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
this is called a pinhole camera now what

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.550 
this is called a pinhole camera now what
do<00:03:52.550> you<00:03:52.580> notice<00:03:52.880> when<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.090> have<00:03:53.240> it<00:03:53.360> here<00:03:53.690> it's

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
do you notice when I have it here it's

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.010 
do you notice when I have it here it's
pretty<00:03:54.890> small<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.250> bright<00:03:55.610> right<00:03:56.020> what

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
pretty small and bright right what

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.270 
pretty small and bright right what
happens<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.560> when<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.710> move<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.010> up<00:03:58.100> like

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
happens to it when I move it up like

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.979 
happens to it when I move it up like
this

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
this

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.140 
this
it<00:04:00.989> gets<00:04:01.170> bigger<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:01.739> maybe<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:02.849> not<00:04:03.000> as

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it gets bigger and maybe is it not as

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.729 
it gets bigger and maybe is it not as
bright<00:04:03.390> as<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.599> was<00:04:03.810> well<00:04:04.319> let<00:04:04.439> me<00:04:04.530> show<00:04:04.680> you

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
bright as it was well let me show you

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.500 
bright as it was well let me show you
something<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.189> have<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.400> cool<00:04:05.700> little<00:04:05.730> gadget<00:04:06.209> I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
something I have a cool little gadget I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.300 
something I have a cool little gadget I
put<00:04:06.689> together<00:04:06.840> here<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.769> basically<00:04:07.980> just

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
put together here it's basically just

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.970 
put together here it's basically just
this<00:04:08.989> piece<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.140> paper<00:04:10.319> with<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.590> hole<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.859> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
this piece of paper with a hole in it

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.459 
this piece of paper with a hole in it
you<00:04:11.069> see<00:04:11.129> that<00:04:11.659> but<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.840> case<00:04:13.019> I<00:04:13.260> put<00:04:13.409> a

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.469 
you see that but in this case I put a

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.170 
you see that but in this case I put a
mirror<00:04:13.769> behind<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.370> now<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:14.849> I'm<00:04:14.909> gonna<00:04:15.000> do

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
mirror behind it now what I'm gonna do

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.789 
mirror behind it now what I'm gonna do
is<00:04:15.329> I'm<00:04:15.480> going<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.840> reflect<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.380> down<00:04:16.410> into

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
is I'm going to reflect it down into

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.810 
is I'm going to reflect it down into
that<00:04:16.979> box<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:18.780> box<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.769> put<00:04:19.979> there<00:04:20.190> because<00:04:20.489> if

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that box the box we put there because if

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.430 
that box the box we put there because if
you<00:04:20.880> put<00:04:21.030> your<00:04:21.150> head<00:04:21.239> inside<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.570> box<00:04:21.840> it's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
you put your head inside the box it's

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.629 
you put your head inside the box it's
nice<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:22.889> dark<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.280> there

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
nice and dark in there

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.670 
nice and dark in there
the<00:04:23.820> farther<00:04:24.150> away<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.509> project<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.289> spot<00:04:25.530> of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
the farther away we project the spot of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.680 
the farther away we project the spot of
light<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.220> larger<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.699> will<00:04:26.789> get<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.600> will

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
light the larger it will get but it will

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.749 
light the larger it will get but it will
also<00:04:27.780> get<00:04:28.020> fainter<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.130> we're<00:04:29.400> gonna<00:04:29.520> put<00:04:29.729> it

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
also get fainter so we're gonna put it

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.279 
also get fainter so we're gonna put it
inside<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.240> box<00:04:30.419> we<00:04:30.750> have<00:04:30.780> some<00:04:30.990> telescopes

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
inside the box we have some telescopes

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.290 
inside the box we have some telescopes
over<00:04:31.800> here<00:04:31.979> that<00:04:32.130> have<00:04:32.280> special<00:04:32.699> filters<00:04:33.090> on

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
over here that have special filters on

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.390 
over here that have special filters on
them<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.750> make<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.080> safe<00:04:34.349> to<00:04:34.650> look<00:04:35.190> through

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
them that make it safe to look through

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
them that make it safe to look through
these<00:04:35.520> telescopes<00:04:35.880> at<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.389> Sun<00:04:36.599> through<00:04:36.840> this

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
these telescopes at the Sun through this

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.140 
these telescopes at the Sun through this
kind<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.800> telescope<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.759> might<00:04:38.940> see

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
kind of telescope you might see

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.909 
kind of telescope you might see
something<00:04:39.539> like<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.930> on<00:04:40.139> a<00:04:40.199> day<00:04:40.590> where<00:04:40.830> there

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
something like this on a day where there

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.159 
something like this on a day where there
are<00:04:41.070> sunspots<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.910> smallest<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.690> those<00:04:42.840> dots

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
are sunspots the smallest of those dots

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.810 
are sunspots the smallest of those dots
you<00:04:43.440> see<00:04:43.470> here<00:04:43.860> is<00:04:43.919> about<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.280> size<00:04:44.550> of<00:04:44.729> the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
you see here is about the size of the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.760 
you see here is about the size of the
earth<00:04:44.870> sometimes<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:46.020> might<00:04:46.169> see<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> dark

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
earth sometimes you might see a dark

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.830 
earth sometimes you might see a dark
streak<00:04:47.220> those<00:04:47.759> are<00:04:47.940> called<00:04:48.120> filaments<00:04:48.660> and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
streak those are called filaments and

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.680 
streak those are called filaments and
they're<00:04:49.650> basically<00:04:50.039> clouds<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.729> gas<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.539> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
they're basically clouds of gas in the

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.930 
they're basically clouds of gas in the
Earth's<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.320> sun's<00:04:52.560> atmosphere<00:04:52.940> you

Earth's of the sun's atmosphere you

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.930 
Earth's of the sun's atmosphere you
might<00:04:54.120> see<00:04:54.360> bright<00:04:55.259> areas<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.220> bright<00:04:56.520> areas

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
might see bright areas the bright areas

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.890 
might see bright areas the bright areas
are<00:04:57.150> called<00:04:57.360> plage<00:04:57.750> up<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.919> side<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.460> Sun

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
are called plage up the side of the Sun

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.240 
are called plage up the side of the Sun
against<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:00.930> darkness<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.590> space<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:02.039> might

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
against the darkness of space you might

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.360 
against the darkness of space you might
see<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:03.240> brighter<00:05:03.780> cloud<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.130> called<00:05:05.310> a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
see a brighter cloud that is called a

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.550 
see a brighter cloud that is called a
prominence<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.659> sun's<00:05:06.930> about<00:05:07.139> the<00:05:07.409> most

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
prominence the sun's about the most

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.200 
prominence the sun's about the most
important<00:05:08.070> thing<00:05:08.190> in<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.400> universe<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:09.060> us

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
important thing in the universe to us

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.350 
important thing in the universe to us
because<00:05:09.659> from<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.620> Sun<00:05:10.889> all<00:05:11.340> energy<00:05:12.000> for<00:05:12.210> life

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
because from the Sun all energy for life

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.659 
because from the Sun all energy for life
on<00:05:12.570> Earth<00:05:12.599> comes<00:05:13.080> among<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> astronomical

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
on Earth comes among the astronomical

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.939 
on Earth comes among the astronomical
objects<00:05:15.150> it's<00:05:15.479> one<00:05:15.900> of<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.260> few<00:05:16.560> things<00:05:16.740> in

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
objects it's one of the few things in

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.500 
objects it's one of the few things in
the<00:05:17.099> sky<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.639> can<00:05:17.789> actually<00:05:18.000> see

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
the sky that you can actually see

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.689 
the sky that you can actually see
changes<00:05:19.110> in<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:20.039> watch<00:05:20.250> things

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
changes in so you can watch things
