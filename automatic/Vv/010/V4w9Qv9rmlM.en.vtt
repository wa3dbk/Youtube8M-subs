it is currently 226 a.m. and I just got

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.549 
it is currently 226 a.m. and I just got
back<00:00:08.820> from<00:00:08.940> visiting<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.420> friend<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.750> mine<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
on the way back home I had an idea for a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.070 
on the way back home I had an idea for a
video<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.730> people<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
video a lot of people don't know what it

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620 
video a lot of people don't know what it
feels<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> vehicle<00:00:20.580> hydroplanes<00:00:21.270> or

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
feels like when a vehicle hydroplanes or

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.040 
feels like when a vehicle hydroplanes or
they<00:00:21.750> don't<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> signs<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.100> are

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
they don't know the signs that they are

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.519 
they don't know the signs that they are
close<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.230> hydroplaning<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
close to hydroplaning and this is just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.260 
close to hydroplaning and this is just
an<00:00:28.740> idea<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.119> show<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> first

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
an idea I had to show the first

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
an idea I had to show the first
indication<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.570> about<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.590> are

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
indication that you are about to or are

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400 
indication that you are about to or are
hydroplaning<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.960> steering<00:00:37.290> wheel

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
hydroplaning is that your steering wheel

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.209 
hydroplaning is that your steering wheel
will<00:00:38.340> twitch<00:00:39.110> we're<00:00:40.110> driving<00:00:40.440> along<00:00:40.559> doing

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
will twitch we're driving along doing

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
will twitch we're driving along doing
your<00:00:41.370> normal<00:00:41.700> thing<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.480> ceremony

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
your normal thing and the ceremony

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
your normal thing and the ceremony
itself<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:44.340> make<00:00:44.370> rapid<00:00:44.969> movements<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:46.280> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
itself will make rapid movements as the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
itself will make rapid movements as the
front<00:00:47.879> wheels<00:00:48.030> start<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> lose<00:00:48.600> traction<00:00:48.629> so

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
front wheels start to lose traction so

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.610 
front wheels start to lose traction so
it'll<00:00:50.570> start<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> number<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it'll start to do this number and you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.290 
it'll start to do this number and you
may<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:52.770> notice<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.550> traction<00:00:53.969> control<00:00:54.270> light

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
may even notice a traction control light

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.790 
may even notice a traction control light

road<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> protip<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.369> idea<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
road just a protip had an idea for it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
road just a protip had an idea for it
figured<00:01:39.240> I'd<00:01:39.329> throw<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.780> YouTube<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
figured I'd throw it up on YouTube in
