now you will not be able to shock your
components<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:47.510> grasp<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.989> processor<00:00:49.710> do

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
best way to grab it is to grab it by the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.700 
best way to grab it is to grab it by the
edges<00:00:58.280> or<00:00:59.280> corners<00:00:59.399> I<00:01:00.230> can't<00:01:01.230> grab<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> by<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
edges or corners I can't grab it by the

edges or corners I can't grab it by the
edges<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:05.540> note<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.780> small<00:01:07.439> gold

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
edges here note these small gold

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.950 
edges here note these small gold
connectors<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:12.380> slight<00:01:13.380> mishap

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
connectors a slight mishap

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
connectors a slight mishap
if<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.650> touch<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> oils<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.759> your

if you touch these the oils from your
fingers<00:01:18.330> will<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.250> guess<00:01:21.350> prevent<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.710> much

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
fingers will I guess prevent as much

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.440 
fingers will I guess prevent as much
connectivity<00:01:25.729> now<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.970> how<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> hold<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
connectivity now you know how to hold a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.859 
connectivity now you know how to hold a
processor<00:01:28.490> now<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> open<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
processor now you have to open up the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
processor now you have to open up the
motherboard<00:01:31.350> socket<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> processor

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.770 

you<00:01:40.479> see<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:40.840> arm<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.909> have<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.179> push<00:01:43.450> down

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
you see this arm you have to push down

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.380 
you see this arm you have to push down
on<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.729> pull<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.479> out<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.819> then<00:01:48.819> push

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
on it and then pull it out and then push

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.770 
on it and then pull it out and then push
it<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.670> flip<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.569> cover<00:01:52.719> off<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:58.060> when

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
it back and flip the cover off now when

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.809 
it back and flip the cover off now when
installing<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.979> process<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.549> there<00:02:00.670> are

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
installing the process that there are

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.109 
installing the process that there are
identical<00:02:01.689> gold<00:02:01.990> connectors<00:02:02.789> and<00:02:03.789> you<00:02:03.939> must

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
identical gold connectors and you must

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.679 
identical gold connectors and you must
match<00:02:04.329> them<00:02:04.630> up<00:02:04.750> but<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.729> can<00:02:06.880> be<00:02:06.909> difficulty

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
match them up but that can be difficulty

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.280 
match them up but that can be difficulty
as<00:02:07.959> their<00:02:08.799> notches<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.879> socket<00:02:10.299> on<00:02:10.509> the

as their notches in the socket on the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.520 
as their notches in the socket on the
actual<00:02:11.650> gold<00:02:11.860> connectors<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:13.569> none<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.079> the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
actual gold connectors but none on the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.289 
actual gold connectors but none on the
CPU<00:02:15.010> itself<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> what<00:02:17.590> Intel<00:02:18.129> decided<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.150> do

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
CPU itself so what Intel decided to do

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.160 
CPU itself so what Intel decided to do
thankfully<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:21.760> put<00:02:22.150> little<00:02:22.390> notches<00:02:22.780> at

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
thankfully they put little notches at

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.819 
thankfully they put little notches at
the<00:02:23.290> top<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:27.099> bottom<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.349> can<00:02:29.590> see

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
the top and the bottom if you can see

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.839 
the top and the bottom if you can see
there<00:02:30.099> at<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.299> little<00:02:31.599> notch<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.549> correspond<00:02:33.549> to

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
there at a little notch I correspond to

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:44.610 
there at a little notch I correspond to
small<00:02:34.239> notches<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.079> motherboard<00:02:35.620> now<00:02:43.620> if

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
small notches on the motherboard now if

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.680 
small notches on the motherboard now if
you<00:02:44.859> match<00:02:45.099> them<00:02:45.340> up<00:02:45.459> correctly<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.359> should

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you match them up correctly it should

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.050 
you match them up correctly it should
just<00:02:46.870> pop<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:48.959> see<00:02:49.959> if<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.349> matches<00:02:50.650> up<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
just pop in see if this matches up that

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.309 
just pop in see if this matches up that
should<00:02:52.329> match<00:02:52.599> up<00:02:53.160> now<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:55.180> simply<00:02:58.290> drop<00:02:59.290> it

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
should match up now you simply drop it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:08.000 
should match up now you simply drop it
in<00:03:04.560> drop<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.739> in<00:03:05.889> it<00:03:06.609> should<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.180> fit<00:03:07.480> there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
in drop it in it should just fit there

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.509 
in drop it in it should just fit there
don't<00:03:09.010> put<00:03:09.310> any<00:03:09.459> pressure<00:03:09.730> on<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.000> yet<00:03:10.660> and
