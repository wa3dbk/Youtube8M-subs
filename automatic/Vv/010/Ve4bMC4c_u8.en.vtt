00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000 

the<00:01:17.760> pressure<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.290> Canucks<00:01:19.590> heading<00:01:19.890> into

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
the pressure on the Canucks heading into

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.190 
the pressure on the Canucks heading into
this<00:01:20.160> postseason<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.390> been<00:01:21.540> immense

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this postseason it's been immense

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
this postseason it's been immense
how<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.620> you<00:01:23.070> read<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> pressure<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
how have you read the pressure in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.720 
how have you read the pressure in
Vancouver<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> pressure<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> there

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
Vancouver I think the pressure is there

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.320 
Vancouver I think the pressure is there
the<00:01:27.600> pressure<00:01:27.980> from<00:01:28.980> outsides<00:01:29.490> definitely

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
the pressure from outsides definitely

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.960 
the pressure from outsides definitely
there<00:01:30.510> but<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.940> goal<00:01:32.940> in

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
there but you know we have a goal in

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420 
there but you know we have a goal in
mind<00:01:33.150> inside<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.960> dressing<00:01:34.350> room<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.680> for

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
mind inside that dressing room and for

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880 
mind inside that dressing room and for
us<00:01:35.580> we<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:36.990> job<00:01:37.050> with<00:01:37.350> deflecting<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
us we do a good job with deflecting that

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.410 
us we do a good job with deflecting that
pressure<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.370> comes<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.940> outside<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
pressure that comes from the outside and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
pressure that comes from the outside and
with<00:01:39.540> worry<00:01:39.750> about<00:01:40.020> keeping<00:01:40.830> ourselves

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
with worry about keeping ourselves

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.070 
with worry about keeping ourselves
accountable<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.870> really

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
accountable and I think that really

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.590 
accountable and I think that really
helps<00:01:43.440> with<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.070> big<00:01:44.280> picture<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.480> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
helps with the big picture and all the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
helps with the big picture and all the
pressure<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:46.110> comes<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.650> playing<00:01:47.370> in<00:01:47.520> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pressure that comes with playing in a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
pressure that comes with playing in a
Canadian<00:01:47.880> city<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> playing<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.920> hockey
