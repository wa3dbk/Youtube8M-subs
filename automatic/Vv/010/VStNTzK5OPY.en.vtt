00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.840
 at the end of the war the tractor has 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.940
 revolutionized agriculture 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.910
 today the use this one remains 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.459
 the indispensable tool transport with 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.710
 tillage tillage sowing its shape 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.300
 remains unchanged in particular with 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.429
 different road sizes 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.500
 you have the front bridge that turns less 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.439
 fast as the rear deck and for that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.990
 we can avoid having a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.009
 skating on the front or back we are 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 obliged to differentiate at the level of 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.270
 wheel tires leased on a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 height of about 1 meter 90 for a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.080
 width 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.370
 world put me with 280 horses this 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.940
 model is three times more powerful 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.700
 than a car 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.130
 yet the maximum speed rises to 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.770
 40 km time and anti pollution standards 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.370
 are more drastic than those of 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.920
 automotive 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.310
 we start coming up on standards 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.540
 antipollution of heavy goods vehicles and others 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.040
 ways today we only go up from 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.130
 consume less and less and years 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.150
 in the years to come 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.059
 we will have to redo a new 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.430
 engine for fire these flights this evolution 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 it's the advanced engines 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.390
 technologically what impresses the 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:26.560
 the more the general public remains the cabin of 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:29.350
 competition not fast 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.479
 but precisely the pilot gps 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.400
 alone in the plots and 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.140
 assistants can automate 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.240
 reversals a piece of field the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.880
 authors in fact it's saves when 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.640
 even helped a VCR the input of 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.259
 singing with his material and the output he 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.950
 is to support this several commands 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.539
 different 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 just press play and pose 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.250
 to select season until have 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 all tractors are pre-arranged 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.300
 and for the guide the autoguiding 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.819
 mainly the gps what's the point 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.890
 it serves that the tractor this driver 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.410
 automatically in a plot must 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.500
 a precision still very important 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.330
 who enter one to five centimeters tall 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.950
 maximum we will save money 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.110
 fuel of operators and employees 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.270
 Farmers automatically have the permit 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.900
 heavyweight is super heavy 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.520
 indispensable for driving 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.500
 tractors that offers a level 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.050
 soundproofing comfort and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 automation ahead of 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.080
 automotive 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.730
 so the driver's seat every time 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.030
 that a person sits on it he goes 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 calculate his weight and so he will inflate 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 or deflated to have the best 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610
 suspension for the driver to be 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.710
 the most comfortable possible 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.510
 air conditioning of course you have a 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.080
 seat so equipped with suspensions 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.860
 pneumatic tires with suspensions 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.590
 side air conditioning heated seats one 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.140
 relatively large passenger seat and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.270
 so you have after a cabin 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130
 suspended tires like a truck 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.380
 since we have functions that the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.050
 cars may have by here a 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.140
 ten years lens is significantly more 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.630
 evolved today into a tractor driver 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.640
 with a button a car not the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.500
 white with two buttons 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.750
 speed and do not drive forward or 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.100
 back thanks to the technology the 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.330
 tractors today seem is 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.610
 simple to fly 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.890
 so farmers are the first 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.410
 to use the inventions that tomorrow 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.440
 will integrate common cars from 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.440
 deadly
