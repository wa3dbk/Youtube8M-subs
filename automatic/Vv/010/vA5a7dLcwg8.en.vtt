00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.600 

so<00:00:02.320> tell<00:00:02.560> us<00:00:02.590> a<00:00:02.770> little<00:00:02.860> bit<00:00:03.040> about<00:00:03.310> the<00:00:03.460> bike

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.610 
so tell us a little bit about the bike

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.360 
so tell us a little bit about the bike
well<00:00:04.510> it's<00:00:04.840> a<00:00:04.960> it's<00:00:05.350> really<00:00:05.799> an<00:00:05.920> elliptical

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
well it's a it's really an elliptical

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.070 
well it's a it's really an elliptical
cross-trainer<00:00:06.609> on<00:00:07.089> wheels<00:00:07.359> so<00:00:07.720> this<00:00:07.899> makes

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
cross-trainer on wheels so this makes

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.070 
cross-trainer on wheels so this makes
the<00:00:08.290> elliptical<00:00:08.889> fun<00:00:09.269> well<00:00:10.269> it<00:00:10.570> ellipticals

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
the elliptical fun well it ellipticals

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.810 
the elliptical fun well it ellipticals
some<00:00:11.349> people<00:00:11.620> like<00:00:11.800> being<00:00:12.070> inside<00:00:12.190> but<00:00:12.610> a<00:00:12.639> lot

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
some people like being inside but a lot

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.629 
some people like being inside but a lot
of<00:00:12.849> us<00:00:13.090> like<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:13.599> be<00:00:13.809> out<00:00:14.019> so<00:00:14.469> it<00:00:15.160> actually<00:00:15.370> adds

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
of us like to be out so it actually adds

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.429 
of us like to be out so it actually adds
a<00:00:15.940> few<00:00:16.119> more<00:00:16.330> features<00:00:16.599> to<00:00:16.779> elliptical<00:00:17.290> too

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
a few more features to elliptical too

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.050 
a few more features to elliptical too
because<00:00:17.680> when<00:00:17.800> your<00:00:17.919> elliptical<00:00:18.189> you<00:00:18.910> have<00:00:19.029> a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
because when your elliptical you have a

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.550 
because when your elliptical you have a
flywheel<00:00:19.540> that<00:00:19.720> pushes<00:00:19.989> you<00:00:20.050> along<00:00:20.169> a<00:00:20.349> little

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
flywheel that pushes you along a little

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.229 
flywheel that pushes you along a little
bit<00:00:20.710> so<00:00:20.860> your<00:00:20.950> arms<00:00:21.250> really<00:00:21.489> don't<00:00:21.700> have<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.119> do

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
bit so your arms really don't have to do

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.450 
bit so your arms really don't have to do
a<00:00:22.270> whole<00:00:22.450> lot<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:23.079> and<00:00:23.710> your<00:00:23.980> motion<00:00:24.399> is

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
a whole lot and and your motion is

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.700 
a whole lot and and your motion is
pretty<00:00:24.700> much<00:00:24.820> just<00:00:25.029> vertical<00:00:25.570> here<00:00:26.410> in<00:00:26.559> order

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
pretty much just vertical here in order

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.159 
pretty much just vertical here in order
to<00:00:26.800> steer<00:00:27.189> this<00:00:27.369> we<00:00:28.210> have<00:00:28.360> to<00:00:28.480> lean<00:00:28.689> back<00:00:28.960> and

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
to steer this we have to lean back and

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.560 
to steer this we have to lean back and
forth<00:00:29.439> okay<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.700> while<00:00:30.939> you're<00:00:31.149> propelling

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
forth okay so while you're propelling

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.940 
forth okay so while you're propelling
yourself<00:00:31.660> with<00:00:31.930> arms<00:00:32.169> and<00:00:32.230> legs<00:00:32.320> are<00:00:32.680> using

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
yourself with arms and legs are using

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.470 
yourself with arms and legs are using
core<00:00:33.160> muscles<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.610> lean<00:00:33.790> back<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.120> forth<00:00:34.330> and

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
core muscles to lean back and forth and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.510 
core muscles to lean back and forth and
steer<00:00:34.720> so<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.020> really<00:00:35.380> go<00:00:35.530> get<00:00:35.830> an<00:00:35.920> immense

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
steer so you really go get an immense

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.730 
steer so you really go get an immense
amount<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.970> muscle<00:00:37.150> activity<00:00:37.750> going<00:00:38.110> on<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.710> I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
amount of muscle activity going on so I

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.960 
amount of muscle activity going on so I
would<00:00:38.950> imagine<00:00:39.040> this<00:00:39.430> burns<00:00:39.670> more<00:00:39.910> calories

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
would imagine this burns more calories

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.630 
would imagine this burns more calories
than<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.530> end<00:00:41.650> almost<00:00:42.010> everything<00:00:42.400> we<00:00:42.520> can

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
than the end almost everything we can

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.590 
than the end almost everything we can
find<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.480> many<00:00:43.630> few<00:00:44.440> days<00:00:45.240> we've<00:00:46.240> got<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.420> couple

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
find so many few days we've got a couple

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.900 
find so many few days we've got a couple
of<00:00:46.780> different<00:00:47.050> measurements<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.560> that<00:00:47.910> one

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
of different measurements of that one

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.390 
of different measurements of that one
from<00:00:49.120> a<00:00:49.180> bodybugg<00:00:49.630> system<00:00:50.110> one<00:00:50.260> from<00:00:50.470> a<00:00:50.590> belt

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
from a bodybugg system one from a belt

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.340 
from a bodybugg system one from a belt
that<00:00:51.490> was<00:00:51.760> monitoring<00:00:52.420> heart<00:00:52.750> rate<00:00:52.960> we're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
that was monitoring heart rate we're

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.130 
that was monitoring heart rate we're
comparing<00:00:53.680> them<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:53.920> riding<00:00:54.280> bicycles<00:00:54.820> around

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
comparing them to riding bicycles around

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.300 
comparing them to riding bicycles around
we're<00:00:56.140> getting<00:00:56.230> about<00:00:56.530> fifty<00:00:56.860> percent<00:00:57.130> more

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
we're getting about fifty percent more

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.400 
we're getting about fifty percent more
calories<00:00:57.700> in<00:00:57.730> riding<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.150> bike<00:00:58.329> if<00:00:59.140> they<00:00:59.290> do

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
calories in riding a bike if they do

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.260 
calories in riding a bike if they do
they'll<00:00:59.739> endure<00:01:00.010> ellipticals<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.790> the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
they'll endure ellipticals and the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.610 
they'll endure ellipticals and the
Biggest<00:01:01.540> Loser<00:01:01.570> where<00:01:01.870> we've<00:01:01.989> used<00:01:02.170> these<00:01:02.410> on

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
Biggest Loser where we've used these on

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.160 
Biggest Loser where we've used these on
campus<00:01:03.310> there<00:01:03.550> they<00:01:04.210> were<00:01:04.269> getting<00:01:04.479> around<00:01:04.839> 12

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
campus there they were getting around 12

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.770 
campus there they were getting around 12
to<00:01:05.229> 13<00:01:05.740> calories<00:01:06.190> per<00:01:06.400> minute<00:01:06.700> on<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.479> indoor

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
to go 17 to 20 so it's not only better

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.340 
to go 17 to 20 so it's not only better
visually<00:01:13.190> but<00:01:13.490> also<00:01:13.910> for<00:01:14.210> your<00:01:14.330> body<00:01:14.420> you're

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
doing a lot of work but you don't know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.040 
doing a lot of work but you don't know
it<00:01:16.640> because<00:01:16.760> everything<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.540> distributed

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
it because everything is distributed

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.660 
it because everything is distributed
over<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.290> whole<00:01:18.440> body<00:01:18.650> everything's<00:01:19.310> working
