00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi girls today video on this cool 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.189
 Crazy 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.769
 these silicone molds that 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 they really surprised me that you tried 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 five minutes ago the young man is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.090
 in love these go to be good 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 fritti store puts the link in the info box 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.949
 they are used both with gel and with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 acrylic powder, however, I tried 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 only gospel because with the monomer 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.720
 I don't have a good relationship, I do n't like it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 it stinks and so I prefer to avoid it 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.920
 so what you will need that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 that you will need the molds in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 silicone and gel color of the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.250
 I will use these before band that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.200
 use only one for decorations 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 pliers of this type a dotter and then if 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 you want to make the decorations on if 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.859
 you want to do some putting on obviously 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.379
 a small brush and then the pads for 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:07.260
 we need nothing to degrease this 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.630
 and then of course a better sealant 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.200
 if without dispersion to have 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.750
 so the final effect is more polished 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 let's start from the little bow they make you 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 see the bigger one so maybe you 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 he sees better what is very simple to do 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.170
 easiest method to take the gel 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 color of the color you prefer here I have 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.630
 mixed color is not okay 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.360
 nothing happened 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.570
 we take the abundant ball with the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.570
 Dr. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:48.140
 we are going to fill our own 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.140
 little bow 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.070
 when we have achieved it then uniforms 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.790
 I have to admit lamp for 4 minutes 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:13.520
 in the meantime we take ours 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:19.370
 little butterflies and let's make a bi 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:23.290
 color ie we put the color first 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.290
 milan pulled over the body 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.590
 I recommend the colors of course yes 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.550
 must leaders are the butterfly will come 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.550
 detached 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.540
 we put in four finished lamps 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.590
 minutes 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.940
 we are going to degrease the upper part e 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.810
 simply drain and flex 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:25.090
 here our perfect bow 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:29.709
 we also break down to the upper part e 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:35.829
 right now or leave it like this 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:40.140
 so let's go to seal helping ourselves 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.140
 with pliers because it's tiny 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:56.099
 let's move on to the sealant and put it in 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:04:00.069
 lamp scassiamo here is ours 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.099
 bow tie also in this case if 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.829
 we want we can do the contours with the 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.959
 black or we can leave it that way 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.549
 not bad 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.319
 look pure antennas are perfect 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.530
 too too cute 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:20.919
 we must degrease for here and also here 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.830
 then we go to put the sealant here 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.130
 what he did for the moment that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.260
 must therefore make them both of a color and 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.669
 of different colors with gels or li 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.620
 decorate him 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.349
 this in fact, however, to be regulated with the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.539
 gel, however, a half cacchetta took place 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.580
 anyway i'm too nice i'll do it 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.710
 lots of them especially for attackable 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.800
 on the covers because they are not even 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.810
 too thick so they shouldn't 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.389
 break away easily if you attack them 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.349
 well I hope I have been useful to you 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.349
 kiss to the next
