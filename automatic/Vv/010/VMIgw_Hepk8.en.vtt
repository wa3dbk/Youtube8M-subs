00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
the stats are pretty good army of one I

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.319 
the stats are pretty good army of one I
don't<00:04:12.909> know<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:14.549> haven't<00:04:15.549> used<00:04:15.819> any<00:04:16.000> guns<00:04:16.180> that

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
don't know I haven't used any guns that

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.110 
don't know I haven't used any guns that
have<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:18.130> unassisted<00:04:18.519> kills<00:04:18.880> it

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
have that so but unassisted kills it

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.610 
have that so but unassisted kills it
seems<00:04:19.510> like<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> sniper<00:04:19.900> headshot<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.500> going

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
seems like a sniper headshot it's going

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.360 
seems like a sniper headshot it's going
to<00:04:20.680> be<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.859> most<00:04:20.979> likely<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:23.169> do<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:23.919> so

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
to be the most likely to do that so so

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.310 
to be the most likely to do that so so
