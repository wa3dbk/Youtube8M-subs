or two to think this over and I think

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.099 
or two to think this over and I think
before<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.670> make<00:00:05.879> any<00:00:06.029> right<00:00:06.330> decisions

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
before I make any right decisions

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
something like this before I'm sure this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.359 
something like this before I'm sure this

fiberglass lightweight they ain't never
going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.890> rush<00:00:23.600> well<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.779> got<00:00:24.930> little

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
going to rush well it's got little

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.140 
going to rush well it's got little
screws<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.980> bedding<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.430> medals<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
screws and bedding and medals for the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.980 
screws and bedding and medals for the
trip<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:28.910> it<00:00:29.910> would<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.150> good<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> use<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
trip now it would be good to use this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
trip now it would be good to use this
and<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.380> can't<00:00:31.650> believe<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.340> would<00:00:32.489> make

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and I can't believe that they would make

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.049 
and I can't believe that they would make
this<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.870> fits<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> outside<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.309> can't

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this it fits on the outside I can't

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
this it fits on the outside I can't
believe<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.840> where<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> wouldn't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
believe that make this where it wouldn't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
believe that make this where it wouldn't
fit<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.219> inside<00:00:38.340> unless<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
fit on the inside unless there was a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
fit on the inside unless there was a
purpose<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.460> thinking<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
purpose for that and I'm thinking you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
purpose for that and I'm thinking you
know<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.660> off<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> thought<00:00:43.260> well<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> can

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
know first off I thought well I can

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.020 
know first off I thought well I can
grind<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.250> hole<00:00:44.520> bigger<00:00:46.039> or<00:00:47.039> something<00:00:47.640> but

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
grind that hole bigger or something but

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
grind that hole bigger or something but
then<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.239> thinking<00:00:48.570> well<00:00:48.690> maybe<00:00:48.930> there's<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
then I'm thinking well maybe there's a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.110 
then I'm thinking well maybe there's a
reason<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.890> made<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> way<00:00:50.730> maybe

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
reason they made it that way maybe

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910 
reason they made it that way maybe
there's<00:00:51.360> something<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.750> missing<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there's something I missing something I

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
there's something I missing something I
don't<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.340> maybe<00:00:53.820> there's<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.649> know

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
don't know about maybe there's you know

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
don't know about maybe there's you know
maybe<00:00:55.949> there's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> lip<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.870> fits<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.170> over

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
maybe there's a lip that fits it over

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
maybe there's a lip that fits it over
there<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.699> don't<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.059> any<00:01:00.180> holes

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
there I don't know I don't see any holes

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
there I don't know I don't see any holes
drilled<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.170> thought<00:01:01.379> before

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
drilled in it but I just thought before

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.050 
drilled in it but I just thought before
I<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.399> anything<00:01:02.730> radical<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> could<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I do anything radical you know I could I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
I do anything radical you know I could I
could<00:01:06.240> paint<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.560> cook

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
could paint this all going up and cook

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.370 
could paint this all going up and cook
but<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.310> always<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.909> heavier<00:01:09.380> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
but it's always gonna be heavier and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.250 
but it's always gonna be heavier and
it's<00:01:10.530> always<00:01:10.770> gonna<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.070> prone<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> rust<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's always gonna be prone to rust and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's always gonna be prone to rust and
it<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.979> heavier<00:01:18.020> why<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.170> anything

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
it is a bit heavier why do anything

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
it is a bit heavier why do anything
right<00:01:19.740> I'll<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> after<00:01:20.970> impacts

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
right I'll just put this after impacts

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
right I'll just put this after impacts
see<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.259> anybody

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
see if anybody

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.450 
see if anybody
has<00:01:23.970> had<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.800> situation<00:01:25.800> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.760> before

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
has had a situation like this before

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
has had a situation like this before
whether<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.420> solution<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
whether you know of a solution to it you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
whether you know of a solution to it you
know<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> looks<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.360> glass<00:01:33.690> is

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
know it looks to me like this glass is

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.249 
know it looks to me like this glass is
almost<00:01:36.650> exactly<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.010> size<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.580> hole

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.719 

which<00:01:43.740> makes<00:01:43.950> me<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
which makes me think if there was

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
which makes me think if there was
another<00:01:44.970> piece<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.570> said<00:01:45.840> inside<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.530> on

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
another piece it said inside this on

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
another piece it said inside this on
each<00:01:46.920> side<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.430> bolted<00:01:47.820> through<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.299> you

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
each side and bolted through that you

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.370 
each side and bolted through that you
grumble<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> put<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> glass<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.430> middle

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
grumble to put the glass in the middle

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.289 
grumble to put the glass in the middle
and<00:01:52.380> sandwich<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> between<00:01:53.070> two<00:01:53.670> sides<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and sandwich it between two sides and

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.170 
and sandwich it between two sides and
having<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> tip<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.790> don't<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
having a tip I don't know I'm just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
having a tip I don't know I'm just
wondering<00:01:57.540> why<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.290> make<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.590> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
wondering why they would make it that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
wondering why they would make it that
way<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.490> missing<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.090> concerning

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
way and what I'm missing for concerning
