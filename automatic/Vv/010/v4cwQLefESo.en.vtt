00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.010
 the evolution of man can be shown through civil construction 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.099
 in every season 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 architectural drawings are gaining new fans 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.749
 evolves well 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.849
 Details 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.499
 the creativity of the professionals we design 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.710
 then these works 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.949
 it's inevitable 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 but there are ways to build for 1 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.729
 in the 21st century 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.750
 the technique of using it 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.170
 stones and clay bricks is the same as our ancestors 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.300
 it was time to change 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720
 even introduced himself 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.720
 the opposition of construction 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.540
 with headquarters in são josé do rio preto in the northwest region of the state of são paulo 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.730
 there is one of the most reputed construction companies in the country 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.300
 created the exclusive technology of manufacturing panels in masonry 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.360
 there is a solution 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.039
 nobody should be deceived 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.760
 aimed at building schools 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.690
 three days 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.010
 housing complexes in high-standard housing 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 the raw material used to make the panels is the same as the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.010
 conventional system 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.610
 the buildings 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 are made by placing the bricks vertically 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.790
 so the resistance tripled in me on the part of people 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.990
 has superior quality and resistance to the conventional system 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.500
 the ergonomics are too big 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.380
 this system is to totally eliminate the small construction waste 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 to reach 30% all the electrical and hydraulic part has already been 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.580
 corrected in the panels avoiding wall breakage saving on hiring 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.870
 of skilled labor 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.140
 as the raw material is the same as the conventional system 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.760
 at any time the customer may make extensions or modifications of the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.199
 ibope 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:21.029
 for being an industrialized system another advantage is that the iss rate is 50% 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.069
 smaller 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.760
 with the full house or the name if you have 80 the construction by the system already 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.499
 that at home 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.399
 It is until today I do not sit down faster when we 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:39.049
 built with the jet house is built with tranquility 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.559
 the press does all the monitoring of the work 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:44.499
 occupations like 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.199
 this month 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.239
 inspiration 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.260
 quality 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 hymn execution labor problems 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.539
 The record in security and high quality gt house 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:02.139
 have been tested and approved by recognized research institutes 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.589
 worldwide as 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:04.849
 epstein 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.839
 quality 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:10.839
 with the ISO 9002 certification 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.749
 is by far the smartest solution for anyone who wants to build 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.369
 solution for the present 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.539
 or you build with the jet house 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.839
 stays in prehistory 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:29.969
