name<00:00:07.560> Scotty<00:00:07.859> Olson<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> producer<00:00:08.969> on

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
name Scotty Olson and I'm a producer on

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.509 
name Scotty Olson and I'm a producer on
a<00:00:09.480> need<00:00:09.809> for<00:00:09.990> speed<00:00:10.170> carbon<00:00:10.200> game

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.910 

so<00:00:16.480> I<00:00:16.539> think<00:00:16.810> each<00:00:17.140> year<00:00:17.380> were<00:00:17.529> really<00:00:17.770> looking

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
so I think each year were really looking

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.160 
so I think each year were really looking
to<00:00:18.250> sort<00:00:18.670> of<00:00:18.730> innovate<00:00:19.090> and<00:00:19.240> involve<00:00:19.599> the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
to sort of innovate and involve the

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.349 
to sort of innovate and involve the
French<00:00:20.410> as<00:00:20.619> year-over-year<00:00:21.130> so<00:00:21.670> two<00:00:22.180> things

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
French as year-over-year so two things

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.269 
French as year-over-year so two things
became<00:00:22.720> really<00:00:22.960> obvious<00:00:23.470> during<00:00:24.099> our

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
became really obvious during our

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.370 
became really obvious during our
research<00:00:24.579> one<00:00:24.939> was<00:00:25.090> canyon<00:00:25.480> racing<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:26.320> the

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
research one was canyon racing and the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.839 
research one was canyon racing and the
second<00:00:26.710> thing<00:00:26.739> was<00:00:27.039> the<00:00:27.189> element<00:00:27.489> of<00:00:27.520> cruise

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
second thing was the element of cruise

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.269 
second thing was the element of cruise
and<00:00:28.720> then<00:00:28.900> specifically<00:00:29.470> crews<00:00:30.039> that<00:00:30.220> are

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
and then specifically crews that are

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.799 
and then specifically crews that are
sort<00:00:30.520> of<00:00:30.550> split<00:00:30.880> up<00:00:31.000> amongst<00:00:31.390> car<00:00:31.599> class

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
sort of split up amongst car class

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.840 
sort of split up amongst car class
rivalries<00:00:32.379> so<00:00:32.770> you<00:00:32.829> can<00:00:33.010> expect<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:33.399> see<00:00:33.610> sort

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
rivalries so you can expect to see sort

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.250 
rivalries so you can expect to see sort
of<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.000> similar<00:00:34.300> framework<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.899> I<00:00:34.960> think<00:00:35.170> the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
of a similar framework that I think the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.319 
of a similar framework that I think the
need<00:00:35.410> for<00:00:35.559> speed<00:00:35.680> series<00:00:36.040> has<00:00:36.399> been<00:00:36.640> sort<00:00:37.300> of

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
need for speed series has been sort of

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.840 
need for speed series has been sort of
become<00:00:37.570> known<00:00:37.780> for<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:39.010> carbon<00:00:39.370> this<00:00:39.550> year

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
become known for in carbon this year

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.910 
become known for in carbon this year
it's<00:00:40.329> it's<00:00:40.629> an<00:00:40.780> epic<00:00:41.020> street<00:00:41.260> racing<00:00:41.590> battle

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
it's it's an epic street racing battle

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.380 
it's it's an epic street racing battle
for<00:00:42.070> control<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.579> city<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.059> you're<00:00:43.210> going

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
for control of the city so you're going

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.139 
for control of the city so you're going
out<00:00:43.539> to<00:00:43.750> take<00:00:43.930> control<00:00:44.230> over<00:00:45.000> territory<00:00:46.000> in

out to take control over territory in
the<00:00:46.239> city<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.840> then<00:00:47.020> ultimately<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.650> test

the city and then ultimately to test
your<00:00:48.040> your<00:00:48.280> skill<00:00:48.579> out<00:00:48.610> in<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:48.940> canyons<00:00:49.360> so

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
your your skill out in the canyons so

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.660 
your your skill out in the canyons so
you<00:00:50.079> can<00:00:50.200> expect<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.620> see<00:00:50.829> a<00:00:50.860> lot<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.130> the

of<00:00:58.720> new<00:00:58.810> takes<00:00:59.079> on<00:00:59.260> some<00:00:59.500> classic<00:00:59.980> modes<00:01:00.220> that

of new takes on some classic modes that

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.370 
of new takes on some classic modes that
it<00:01:01.090> can't<00:01:01.239> get<00:01:01.329> into<00:01:01.540> too<00:01:01.660> much<00:01:01.809> detail<00:01:02.200> right

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
it can't get into too much detail right

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.710 
it can't get into too much detail right
now<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.860> we'll<00:01:03.220> be<00:01:03.340> revealing<00:01:04.089> over<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.509> next

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
now but we'll be revealing over the next

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.469 
now but we'll be revealing over the next
few<00:01:04.869> months<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:06.070> think<00:01:06.610> one<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.030> modes<00:01:07.360> that

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
few months I think one of the modes that

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.090 
few months I think one of the modes that
were<00:01:07.630> most<00:01:07.780> excited<00:01:07.990> about<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:08.649> year<00:01:08.920> is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
were most excited about this year is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.289 
were most excited about this year is
actually<00:01:09.490> out<00:01:09.579> in<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.729> canyons<00:01:10.119> in<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
actually out in the canyons in the

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.240 
actually out in the canyons in the
canyon<00:01:10.689> duel<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.110> it's<00:01:11.710> really<00:01:12.070> all<00:01:12.219> about

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
canyon duel and it's really all about

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.789 
canyon duel and it's really all about
racing<00:01:12.880> on<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.119> edge<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.350> really

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
racing on the edge and and really

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.200 
racing on the edge and and really
pushing<00:01:15.159> yourself<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> limits<00:01:16.030> it's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
pushing yourself to the limits it's

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.050 
pushing yourself to the limits it's
definitely<00:01:16.960> probably<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:18.070> most<00:01:18.250> illicit<00:01:18.939> and

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
definitely probably the most illicit and

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.429 
definitely probably the most illicit and
dangerous<00:01:19.450> form<00:01:19.719> of<00:01:19.810> street<00:01:20.049> racing<00:01:20.229> that

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
dangerous form of street racing that

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.340 
dangerous form of street racing that
we've<00:01:20.619> had<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:21.069> game<00:01:21.249> before<00:01:22.350> literally

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
we've had in the game before literally

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.749 
we've had in the game before literally
you're<00:01:23.499> you're<00:01:23.740> going<00:01:23.950> out<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.100> these<00:01:24.310> canyons

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
you're you're going out to these canyons

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.340 
you're you're going out to these canyons
to<00:01:24.939> not<00:01:25.060> only<00:01:25.179> beat<00:01:25.539> your<00:01:25.689> opponent<00:01:26.170> but

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
to not only beat your opponent but

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.599 
to not only beat your opponent but
you're<00:01:26.530> really<00:01:26.740> trying<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.159> survive<00:01:27.429> the

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
you're really trying to survive the

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.550 
you're really trying to survive the
course<00:01:27.850> out<00:01:28.060> there<00:01:28.299> what<00:01:28.810> happens<00:01:29.079> it's<00:01:29.319> a<00:01:29.409> two

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
course out there what happens it's a two

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.069 
course out there what happens it's a two
stage<00:01:29.799> race<00:01:30.069> in<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.969> first<00:01:31.209> stage<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.840> are

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
stage race in the first stage you are

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.959 
stage race in the first stage you are
following<00:01:32.799> the<00:01:32.979> car<00:01:33.159> in<00:01:33.310> front<00:01:33.459> of<00:01:33.609> you<00:01:33.729> and

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
following the car in front of you and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.910 
following the car in front of you and
your<00:01:34.869> goals<00:01:35.049> pretty<00:01:35.229> simple<00:01:35.350> you're<00:01:35.740> trying

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
your goals pretty simple you're trying

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.469 
your goals pretty simple you're trying
to<00:01:35.979> stay<00:01:36.130> as<00:01:36.249> close<00:01:36.459> as<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.789> can<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:36.999> that<00:01:37.240> car

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
to stay as close as you can to that car

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.179 
to stay as close as you can to that car

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
the closer you stay to them the more

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.429 
the closer you stay to them the more
points<00:01:39.429> that<00:01:39.639> you<00:01:39.670> roll<00:01:39.909> up<00:01:40.200> once<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.289> get<00:01:41.409> to

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
points that you roll up once you get to

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.510 
points that you roll up once you get to

you want to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.220 
you want to
so<00:02:23.090> one<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.360> new<00:02:23.480> modes<00:02:23.690> were<00:02:23.840> excited

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
so one of the new modes were excited

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.110 
so one of the new modes were excited
about<00:02:24.380> coming<00:02:24.590> back<00:02:24.860> his<00:02:25.130> drift<00:02:25.400> mode<00:02:25.610> really

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
about coming back his drift mode really

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.310 
about coming back his drift mode really
we<00:02:26.210> took<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.480> year<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:26.690> when<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:27.080> tried<00:02:27.290> to

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
we took a year off when we tried to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.040 
we took a year off when we tried to
reimagine<00:02:27.770> what<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.310> mode<00:02:28.550> was<00:02:29.480> lacking<00:02:29.750> and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
reimagine what that mode was lacking and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.260 
reimagine what that mode was lacking and
what<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.290> could<00:02:30.440> be<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.760> probably<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
what it could be and then probably the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.880 
what it could be and then probably the
feature<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.780> click<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.200> most<00:02:33.380> work<00:02:33.590> into

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
feature that we click the most work into

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.830 
feature that we click the most work into
the<00:02:34.070> bringing<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.360> building<00:02:35.630> on

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the bringing back is really building on

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.450 
the bringing back is really building on
the<00:02:35.930> cop<00:02:36.110> experience<00:02:36.680> from<00:02:36.860> most<00:02:37.070> wanted

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
the cop experience from most wanted

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.220 
the cop experience from most wanted
rather<00:02:38.120> than<00:02:38.270> just<00:02:38.480> kind<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.690> having<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.020> cop

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
rather than just kind of having a cop

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.170 
rather than just kind of having a cop
event<00:02:39.410> or<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:39.770> non<00:02:39.980> cop<00:02:40.250> event<00:02:40.400> we're<00:02:41.060> really

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
event or a non cop event we're really

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.850 
event or a non cop event we're really
trying<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.510> give<00:02:41.630> reason<00:02:41.990> for<00:02:42.200> why<00:02:42.320> cops<00:02:42.650> would

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
trying to give reason for why cops would

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.860 
trying to give reason for why cops would
show<00:02:43.040> up<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.340> specific<00:02:43.580> area<00:02:43.970> or<00:02:44.180> not<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.630> I

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
show up in a specific area or not so I

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.300 
show up in a specific area or not so I
think<00:02:45.260> you'll<00:02:45.380> see<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.620> integration<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
think you'll see the integration of the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.160 
think you'll see the integration of the
cops<00:02:46.580> into<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.030> story<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.510> into<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.870> career

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
cops into the story and into the career

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.780 
cops into the story and into the career
mode<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.530> little<00:02:48.920> bit<00:02:49.040> deeper<00:02:49.190> than<00:02:49.370> we<00:02:49.610> did

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
mode a little bit deeper than we did

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.880 
mode a little bit deeper than we did
back<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> most<00:02:50.930> wanted<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.770> our

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
back on the most wanted so that's our

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.470 
back on the most wanted so that's our
first<00:02:52.040> look<00:02:52.250> at<00:02:52.400> need<00:02:52.580> for<00:02:52.760> speed<00:02:52.940> carbon<00:02:52.970> I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
first look at need for speed carbon I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.510 
first look at need for speed carbon I
think<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.230> wanted<00:02:54.530> people<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:55.070> we're<00:02:55.340> really

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
think we wanted people that we're really

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.070 
think we wanted people that we're really
excited<00:02:55.790> about<00:02:56.120> getting<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> canyon<00:02:56.750> duel<00:02:56.960> out

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
excited about getting a canyon duel out
