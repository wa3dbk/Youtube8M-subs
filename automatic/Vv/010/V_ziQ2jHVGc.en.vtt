 third and the feasibility behind and all the 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.390
 belize anr 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.580

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.640
 super cool and I'm facing in a 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.899
 civil this comes to work I know when 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.060
 I'm studying a book 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.029
 commented so it's in my book all 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.430
 I need a little bit but I'm in it this is 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.670
 a book a download on the internet is 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.020
 very father and already a little advanced 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 advance project although escape 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.680
 little bit of my house and all the people 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.710
 because if I do not do nothing and I like it 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.920
 come to the street 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.290
 divergent know what reason either for 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 I know it's early morning people 5 33 of 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.390
 the afternoon is internally dark this 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.469
 I feel so cold and I'm a chimney 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 that was 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.679
 and because I am super happy after 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.359
 tell you about and practice the out 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.460
 because I'm reviewing all my notes 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.610
 and I realized that I had already 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 commented on another video that there are bases in 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.450
 As for beauty and the primordial is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 an attitude to have our attitude is 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 well I have everything all written but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 more or less try to agree to not 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.130
 know what to see that as it is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.020
 reading but the most important thing about this 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 is that what you project what you 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.429
 projections is what all the people are going to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.250
 create that you are this shows 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.830
 projected security in you I'm not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 saying that you believe 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.659
 it's very very very very but you see that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.450
 you are convinced that you are comfortable with 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.110
 what you are this for example give 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.560
 realize that what everyone is doing 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.510
 it is by your own conviction I always say 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.150
 the most important thing is an attitude and 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.820
 then comes a conomic attitude but 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.180
 that no longer attitude but that is how 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.250
 superb and that is not nice nor people 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 is going to believe something nice about stores and 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.920
 I always take away an attitude with 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.320
 humility my attitude but an attitude that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.200
 reflect that you are sure of yourself 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.730
 that he has is a conviction that what 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.360
 that you just decided to do is what 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.910
 right always without offending others 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.740
 without someone getting hurt I'll 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.340
 I suggest you have a positive attitude 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.520
 towards yourself that you want yourself to leave 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.459
 in the mirror and say good and this at 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.930
 better I 'm not perfect there are things that I 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.940
 they like me but there are things that 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.100
 they like me and then to take advantage and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.130
 is what I have, there is no other way 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.650
 what do you have and are you going to look for 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.670
 those what you have to feel good 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.190

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.210
 super super good attitude is that you already

 I said no from sangron so sacred 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.350
 and watching people follow below 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.870
 let's walk right 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.900
 for yourself to see you nice because it's 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.070
 an elegant pose because your clothes shine 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:51.360
 because you look taller because 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.360
 the neck looks cute 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.780
 well that's all about attitude 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.930
 but it was a tequila 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.360
 do not be rude, do not believe yourself, many are 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.530
 rather the ones that some but do not see 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.600
 nice and when someone has a 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.420
 air attitude that feels exceeds those 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.760
 other does not make you attest to serfaty removes 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.770
 everything nice and there are people who are not 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.890
 so beautiful physically but has a 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.740
 attitude so beautiful that the men the 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.190
 they see beautiful women have 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.730
 envy because there is light because there are calluses 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:36.960
 in their faces and that through your pretty 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.960
 an attitude of humility 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.169
 already touches many types of attitude but 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.479
 remember your attitude 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:49.029
 first of all to love yourself 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:52.729
 that this one is seen to gather me with humility 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:55.009
 this right assures you what you are 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.020
 doing and you will see many changes and 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.220
 now we are going to start to change 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:07.290
 our 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:09.150
 to decorate and there are many costs 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.790
 extras that will only help us to 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.040
 put us out but the most 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.050
 important to be beautiful inside because 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.510
 this so that it reflects good because I 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.500
 like a lot of people are already here 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:24.080
 next east 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.040
 I'm going to leave in this case the mica pile 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.570
 very few minutes that I hope that I 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.280
 have given understand and if you can not 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.760
 write what there is talk up 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.760
 then there is
