00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 mister what a lot it was 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.569
 first half balance in the second though 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.300
 the Verona changed pitch after the goal 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.010
 after the goal 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.820
 I think it changed a little after the goal 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.210
 the ten us race against one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 team that has great quality of its own 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 that big dangers 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 the verona has indeed created I was expecting 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 much more than the tree but the inertia of the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.910
 race has changed 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.260
 on this rigor revised much before 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 doubt because the ball has changed 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 trajectory towards the back and not towards the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.190
 door that was the direction of cacia a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 doubtful rigor for us the first half does not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.329
 conceded rightly canceled the goal of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 litter when these episodes change 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.289
 the match against Verona is hard 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.890
 we can tell them that it was not anymore 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:02.910
 more cynical, perhaps simplistic 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.270
 cynical and defined by the cynic perhaps 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
 reductive because I believe he did 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.810
 the only one of rim porta did it to 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.050
 ninety-fourth with with martino and the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 first time header with 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.830
 I remember the Verona striker in the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.740
 gomez first time of big gomez 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.140
 dangers or who has cc 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.970
 I have not seen any worries too 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.320
 because I've seen so many DVDs of the truth 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.930
 nor has every game created so much and has 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.890
 realized of act and I believe that today the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.119
 my team has done new and more 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.010
 I see a lot of good performances 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.630
 angry mister thought to do 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.880
 no for the episode not for the performance 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.930
 for the episode because after I have it 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.119
 revised if the net rigor then there 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.820
 puts a stone on it then says there is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.690
 the quality of the player is the shear 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.090
 of football damage when a penalty does not 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.110
 exists so he was angry it was doubtful 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.399
 nor for this was very doubtful doubt 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.270
 could stay there but I have not seen no cs 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.940
 of the assistant looks good 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 trajectory of the ball goes back 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.239
 it is evident that the ball makes it the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.340
 defender if you go forward the touched the 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.980
 because he kicked himself into throwing himself 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.900
 on the ground in front of the goalkeeper 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.230
 yes I believe but if the trajectory of the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.060
 ball travels behind and the race of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.080
 I go forward if I touch the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.459
 ball goes forward cacia 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.470
 so the ball is evident that it touches it 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.000
 the defender said this anyway 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.299
 the action was a great championship 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.799
 if, however, we have to face difficulties 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.260
 grit your teeth because we have to 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.209
 count another expulsion today in the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 difficulty in the emergency of the department 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.900
 defensive we have we go ahead and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.900
 prepare the next race
