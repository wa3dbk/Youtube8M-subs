00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.779 
just lends voice to all the things that
I've<00:00:22.599> thought<00:00:22.810> about<00:00:22.869> since<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:24.249> know<00:00:24.579> since

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
I've thought about since you know since

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.210 
I've thought about since you know since
I<00:00:24.909> was<00:00:25.029> very<00:00:25.060> young<00:00:25.300> and<00:00:25.779> this<00:00:26.560> is<00:00:26.740> my<00:00:26.859> fifth

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
I was very young and this is my fifth

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.060 
I was very young and this is my fifth
show<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:28.269> I'm<00:00:28.419> saying<00:00:28.720> letting<00:00:29.619> go<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.769> God

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
show that I'm saying letting go of God

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.330 
show that I'm saying letting go of God
and<00:00:30.960> she<00:00:31.960> just<00:00:32.140> speaks<00:00:32.290> volumes<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:33.270> signs<00:00:34.270> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
and she just speaks volumes to signs and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.910 
and she just speaks volumes to signs and
what<00:00:36.340> questioning<00:00:37.270> is<00:00:37.480> all<00:00:37.810> about<00:00:38.080> and<00:00:38.440> making

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
what questioning is all about and making

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.090 
what questioning is all about and making
that<00:00:39.250> commitment<00:00:39.760> to<00:00:40.240> search<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.920> think

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
that commitment to search and I think

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.800 
that commitment to search and I think
she's<00:00:42.220> done<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.490> hard<00:00:42.670> work<00:00:42.760> for<00:00:43.180> me<00:00:43.270> but<00:00:43.600> I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
she's done the hard work for me but I

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.080 
she's done the hard work for me but I
just<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.650> just<00:00:44.920> think<00:00:45.370> she's<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.550> great<00:00:45.700> example

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
just I just think she's a great example

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.840 
just I just think she's a great example
of<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.630> human<00:00:46.930> being<00:00:47.080> that's<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:48.520> really

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
of a human being that's really really

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.780 
of a human being that's really really
struggled<00:00:49.510> but<00:00:50.020> has<00:00:50.260> finally<00:00:50.680> found<00:00:50.950> the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
struggled but has finally found the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.730 
struggled but has finally found the
voice<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.360> she<00:00:52.600> gives<00:00:52.780> me<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.080> voice<00:00:53.230> at<00:00:53.620> a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
voice and she gives me the voice at a

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.890 
voice and she gives me the voice at a
much<00:00:53.920> younger<00:00:53.950> age<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.910> let<00:00:55.090> go<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.330> God<00:00:55.540> really

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900
