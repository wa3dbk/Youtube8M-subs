 yourself first on the floor and then 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:29.869
 he fucks the whole fuck on twitter 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 was your most embarrassing event that is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.960
 Although not an embarrassing event but it 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 is a sad and him as well 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.170
 really funny story only now 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.360
 just out 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.759
 So I was ten years old so one 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.470
 small tree could then stop wanted 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 absolutely so hamms I was so right 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.610
 in love with these animals i found them that way 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.200
 extremely cute and really cool or 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.520
 I really wanted to go to hamster 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.290
 then I got him still 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.330
 some time and then I have such a 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 I really enjoy the whole thing 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.680
 half day this this little house 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.360
 looked at in her cage we changed 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.820
 because there are nocturnal animals and 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.070
 honestly that we cried the minister 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.479
 that is naturally extinguished in the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.060
 active at night and have it around me during the day 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.780
 I really much of that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.819
 realize 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.260
 yes, after ten days, we'll do that 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.690
 go skiing but with the family and 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880
 so having it alone at home is honest 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.040
 no problem but we have such a 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.280
 cat under cage did not have that 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.560
 widest it goes on and then have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.700
 I go home one day one evening 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.599
 I came home and then there was not 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.970
 more in his cage inside 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.770
 I was just and easy I just got 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.349
 cried I cried I have to 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.060
 nothing understood and it was 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.510
 easy with one of the saddest 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 ninth in my life the ace im 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.560
 I hope, Crater, I have the name 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.390
 have properly explained expressed the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.060
 hashtag pumpkin you may be worth more 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.270
 if I make a profit yes the fruit times 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.270
 I'm pretty good, but that's history 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.450
 Diana Battles wears it like the pumpkin 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.959
 Did you feel like 2000 subscribers 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:19.420
 got 1000 arguments first 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:22.390
 as in the ad hoc emc greeting on the spot 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.160
 I'm the question whether Swiss the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 best Swiss in the 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.430
 afterwards there will be another one 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.019
 france and that is the question of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.269
 someone anonymous who wants to remain anonymous 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.610
 and that is the question what would I do 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.459
 If only I have one more day to live 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.900
 That would be a very good question 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.019
 and I have a really long in mind 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.830
 I think that would break it 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.950
 I would like to do it and I think so 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.090
 I do not know if only I still believe 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.200
 I could have a day to live 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
 not make up for it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.070
 I just could wait now 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.510
 I shit which still build it only 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.579
 but that's what I want everything for everyone 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.810
 not because the last day was when 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.150
 You know that you have one more day to live 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.220
 I thought so then 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.049
 Do not you want to go shit 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.610
 make him or her as a draufmachen 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.980
 or something I really want to go with 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.450
 my family with my friends the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.359
 Last day just spend so nice 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.650
 as possible spend this day and 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.269
 not necessarily the people 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.979
 say I'm dying I do not know 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.450
 because it's such a difficult thing 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.860
 because if people know what to do then 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.960
 Sharpening , they are different to you 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.910
 but me yes that is really one 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.930
 really hard question but i would go up 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.280
 In any case, I believe with my family 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.260
 want to spend this day or with 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.010
 family friends but with my change 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.919
 away most important in the main people 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.260
 In any case because yes, I think that is 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.120
 yes I think that would be for me that 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.770
 most important if I only have one day too 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.289
 but it would never have been alive , of course 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.789
 hopefully will happen naturally and in 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.020
 In that sense, I would say he is 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.210
 been for this video if you like that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.190
 is liked all 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.289
 tremendous impulses will be folk let's play 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.789
 should but do not worry, my dear 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.770
 friends and of course his car 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.770
 leave and it
