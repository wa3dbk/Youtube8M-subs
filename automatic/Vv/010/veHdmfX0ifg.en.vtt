00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
the board using the standard die rolling

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.530 
the board using the standard die rolling
method<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.769> whirlpool<00:04:10.310> will<00:04:10.549> move<00:04:10.820> any<00:04:11.209> time

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
method the whirlpool will move any time

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.440 
method the whirlpool will move any time
you<00:04:11.690> fail<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.260> roll<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.470> 6<00:04:12.890> 7<00:04:13.489> or<00:04:13.760> 8<00:04:13.880> when

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
you fail to roll a 6 7 or 8 when

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.210 
you fail to roll a 6 7 or 8 when
checking<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.989> see<00:04:15.170> if<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.380> die<00:04:15.500> kaiju<00:04:15.799> move

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
checking to see if the die kaiju move

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.240 
checking to see if the die kaiju move
then<00:04:16.850> roll<00:04:17.450> a<00:04:17.479> single<00:04:17.930> die<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.440> move<00:04:19.040> the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
then roll a single die and move the

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.610 
then roll a single die and move the
Whirlpool<00:04:19.729> based<00:04:20.209> on<00:04:20.419> its<00:04:20.540> arrows<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.440> you

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
Whirlpool based on its arrows if you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.770 
Whirlpool based on its arrows if you
roll<00:04:21.829> 5<00:04:22.100> or<00:04:22.280> 6<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:23.030> doesn't<00:04:23.390> move<00:04:23.479> at<00:04:23.660> all

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
roll 5 or 6 it doesn't move at all

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.800 
roll 5 or 6 it doesn't move at all
because<00:04:24.380> it<00:04:24.590> doesn't<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:24.979> those<00:04:25.160> values

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
because it doesn't have those values

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.000 
because it doesn't have those values
basically<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:27.169> whirlpool<00:04:27.560> destroys

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
basically the whirlpool destroys

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.730 
basically the whirlpool destroys
everything<00:04:28.400> so<00:04:29.360> when<00:04:29.630> it<00:04:29.720> moves<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.410> tile

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
everything so when it moves on to a tile

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.640 
everything so when it moves on to a tile
or<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.100> ship<00:04:31.729> they're<00:04:32.360> removed<00:04:32.690> from<00:04:32.750> play<00:04:32.990> if

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
or a ship they're removed from play if

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.680 
or a ship they're removed from play if
it<00:04:33.770> moves<00:04:33.979> on<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.280> die<00:04:34.430> kaiju<00:04:34.729> it's<00:04:35.330> removed

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
it moves on to a die kaiju it's removed

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.380 
it moves on to a die kaiju it's removed
from<00:04:35.810> play<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.440> if<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:36.950> died<00:04:37.070> kaiju<00:04:37.340> lands<00:04:38.270> on

from play and if it died kaiju lands on

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.089 
from play and if it died kaiju lands on
top<00:04:38.570> of<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.780> whirlpool<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.680> whirlpool

top of a whirlpool the whirlpool

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.350 
top of a whirlpool the whirlpool

there<00:04:41.539> goes<00:04:41.689> the<00:04:41.990> whirlpool<00:04:42.800> will<00:04:42.979> only<00:04:43.189> leave
