00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.170
 we continue and now with information 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.760
 technology on this science Wednesday 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.920
 and technology the equator joins the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.600
 list of countries in South America that already 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.970
 They have 4g technology in 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.340
 telecommunications for users at the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.320
 national this means more speed and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.880
 connection signal our team in 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.880
 take away the details 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.880
 the national corporation of 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.300
 telecommunications works in 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.790
 implementation of the mobile network lte is the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.840
 natural evolution of 3g networks towards 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 the 4g network with them can be reached 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.559
 speeds higher than those 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 currently provide operators 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.610
 will allow us to transform what they are 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.340
 the country 's telecommunications 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.060
 We are implementing a network of last 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.060
 lte generation 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.879
 a network that allows to have speeds of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.340
 10 to 15 times the speeds it has 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.619
 you currently the plan is 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.570
 in the first phase and aims to meet the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.830
 cities of Quito and Guayaquil up 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.149
 end of 2013 with 100 bases the pp 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 They will also be equipped with these devices 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.190
 that will help the user to connect to the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.820
 4g platform on this device is that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.040
 connects with the network lte the true but 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.490
 I transmit via wifi and I can 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.580
 connect with my devices to have 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.560
 the experience of lte through all 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.159
 the devices that I only have the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.619
 4g network is the long-term evolution and 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.570
 will be the platform that will sustain new 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.150
 services 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.370
 one of the applications that develops 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.520
 this team is the reality 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 increased for them to use 4g technology 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.500
 it would have favorable results for all 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.200
 users with the implementation from 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.090
 the 4g helps us to develop 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 new products to which our 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.330
 applications have greater capacity in 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.500
 for speed have better 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.510
 better graphics that have a better 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.490
 operation since it makes the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.270
 phones have more signal and are more 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.670
 rapid 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.130
 this technology is also focused 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.070
 to provide sectors with internet 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.920
 urban-marginal that was previously 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.840
 impossible came in recent years 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.170
 access to the internet both fixed and 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.580
 mobile in the country has a growth 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.970
