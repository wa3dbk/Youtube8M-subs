00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.250 
time I go but for someone like me it's
actually<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> pretty<00:03:50.300> practical<00:03:50.540> car<00:03:50.990> and<00:03:51.170> it

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
actually a pretty practical car and it

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.310 
actually a pretty practical car and it
gets<00:03:51.500> decent<00:03:51.950> gas<00:03:52.100> mileage<00:03:53.080> one<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.200> most

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
gets decent gas mileage one of the most

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.800 
gets decent gas mileage one of the most

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
surprising things about owning this car

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.290 
surprising things about owning this car
so<00:03:57.050> far<00:03:57.260> has<00:03:57.440> been<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:58.130> think<00:03:59.000> it's

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
so far has been that I think it's

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.780 
so far has been that I think it's
actually<00:03:59.660> quieter<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:00.980> highway<00:04:01.400> when<00:04:01.700> you

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
actually quieter on the highway when you

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.820 
actually quieter on the highway when you
have<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.060> roof<00:04:02.270> down<00:04:02.660> then<00:04:03.440> when<00:04:03.590> you<00:04:03.680> have

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
have the roof down then when you have

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.180 
have the roof down then when you have
the<00:04:03.980> roof<00:04:04.160> up<00:04:04.430> I've<00:04:05.390> driven<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.780> over<00:04:06.020> 60<00:04:06.470> or<00:04:06.500> 70

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
the roof up I've driven it over 60 or 70

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.130 
the roof up I've driven it over 60 or 70
miles<00:04:07.370> an<00:04:07.520> hour<00:04:07.640> with<00:04:08.210> the<00:04:08.330> roof<00:04:08.510> down<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
miles an hour with the roof down and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.700 
miles an hour with the roof down and
with<00:04:09.710> the<00:04:09.800> roof<00:04:09.950> up<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:11.510> really<00:04:12.140> think<00:04:12.350> it's

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
with the roof up and I really think it's

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.890 
with the roof up and I really think it's
quieter<00:04:13.370> when<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:13.970> have<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.150> roof<00:04:14.330> down<00:04:14.630> I

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
quieter when you have the roof down I

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.289 
quieter when you have the roof down I
don't<00:04:15.020> know<00:04:15.200> if<00:04:15.320> that's<00:04:15.700> because<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.090> the

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
don't know if that's because the the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.060 
don't know if that's because the the
roof<00:04:17.480> rattles<00:04:17.989> or<00:04:18.230> things<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.680> things<00:04:18.920> like

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
roof rattles or things and things like

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.240 
roof rattles or things and things like
that<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:19.970> of<00:04:20.780> course<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.080> get<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.229> lot<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.560> wind

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
that but of course you get a lot of wind

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.450 
that but of course you get a lot of wind
noise<00:04:22.370> when<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> roof<00:04:23.090> is<00:04:23.240> down<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:23.810> that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
noise when the roof is down but that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.570 
noise when the roof is down but that
is<00:04:24.520> not<00:04:25.150> as<00:04:25.300> bad<00:04:25.509> to<00:04:25.750> me<00:04:25.900> as<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.580> constant

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
is not as bad to me as the constant

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.909 
is not as bad to me as the constant
rattling<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.569> buzzing<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> get

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
rattling and and buzzing that you get

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.180 
rattling and and buzzing that you get
when<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.639> roof<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:31.000> up<00:04:31.710> what<00:04:32.710> advice<00:04:32.949> would<00:04:32.979> I

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
when the roof is up what advice would I

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.189 
when the roof is up what advice would I
give<00:04:33.280> somebody<00:04:33.729> that's<00:04:34.180> looking<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.569> buy<00:04:34.810> one

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
give somebody that's looking to buy one

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.249 
give somebody that's looking to buy one
of<00:04:35.380> these<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.949> would<00:04:36.880> say<00:04:37.060> if<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.990> find

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
of these I would say if you find

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.279 
of these I would say if you find
something<00:04:38.470> good<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.830> go<00:04:39.220> for<00:04:39.520> it

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
something good just go for it

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.450 
something good just go for it
it's<00:04:41.289> really<00:04:41.590> hard<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.889> find<00:04:42.039> something

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
it's really hard to find something

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.370 
it's really hard to find something
that's<00:04:42.580> this<00:04:43.060> much<00:04:43.330> fun<00:04:43.660> for<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.110> little

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.040 
that's this much fun for this little
amount<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.650> money<00:04:45.090> especially<00:04:46.090> when<00:04:46.599> when<00:04:46.960> you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
amount of money especially when when you

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.490 
amount of money especially when when you
count<00:04:47.880> maintenance<00:04:48.880> costs<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:50.259> fact

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
count maintenance costs and the fact

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.230
