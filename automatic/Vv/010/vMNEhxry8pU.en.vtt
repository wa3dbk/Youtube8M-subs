every page I read and that really dries

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.700 
every page I read and that really dries
out<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.179> glitter<00:02:05.539> grade<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.080> glitter<00:02:06.289> polish

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
out the glitter grade the glitter polish

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.660 
out the glitter grade the glitter polish
quite<00:02:07.069> nicely<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.200> prevents<00:02:09.200> dragging<00:02:09.709> which

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
quite nicely and prevents dragging which

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.210 
quite nicely and prevents dragging which
is<00:02:10.880> basically<00:02:11.720> what<00:02:11.870> happens<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.890> put<00:02:12.920> on

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.520 

that's<00:02:21.280> basically<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.420> glitter<00:02:23.349> nail
