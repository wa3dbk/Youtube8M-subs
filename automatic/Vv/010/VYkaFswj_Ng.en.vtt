00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.489
 why it's for you 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.559
 as usual 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.099
 with a precision therefore also 1% the gradient is tarnished 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.119
 dauphine first layer 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.419
 more 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.289
 waste 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.869
 so that's too young because too hot so 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.939
 deeper 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 so after ordering bae I was in primary 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.850
 I am happy the fate of domenech ever 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000
 gold this is very very old 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 copÃ© you could see it on the video 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.830
 neil peart size 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.560
 and that's the dtn michel sicard 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.410
 after I showed you on the video that I made myself somehow 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.050
 a small square of ports in giant and dish 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.230
 since why I had 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.000
 so I'm making small cubes 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.240
 and so I want to show how I do for myself 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 the first layer of long time 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.060
 so in fact I do not have the question 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.090
 all gone back to party I want me to just tap right there 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 it's happy because otherwise there is too much 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 I agree with you 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 here 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.970
 so you apply all this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.650
 the number of departures 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 small 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.520
 in the background we take over 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 if you want it to be concluded the most opaque cpe you apply a little 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 more 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.180
 if you want it to be just what m next 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.960
