00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.130
 motionless 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.669
 that's what a failure like a ghost 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.669
 which will go where 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.199
 our fighter 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.570
 Well, so 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.640

 all muscles tense for different tricks 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.080
 can be under the arms were relaxed or 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.500
 on the contrary tense 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.640
 later 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.720
 the camera rotates standard taking 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.430
 if a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.890
 tourism shift can still be omitted 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 rise at different angles 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.920
 in the kitchen we see such as 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.799
 on this joints when pressed which 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 fierce mouse button 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 changeable which way are they 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.820

 here's a fist 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.390
 when a cube is just a plag 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.230

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.000
 different is given 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.990
 here 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.000
 since we walk step by step 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 but you need to commit suicide 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.840
 that is, when you press 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.050
 and and the space move 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.120
 Berkutovts center time distresses 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.900
 in multiplayer a little lower 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 right but hopes 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.180
 but the move also leaves the clinic and points for 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730
 damage 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.570
 but in principle, give everything to try 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.450
 hit the enemy first here is the body 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.800

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.899
 Efremov was born a year 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.559

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.799
 right hand 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.799
 now let's 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.659
 more and more 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659

 space because there may be time 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.100
