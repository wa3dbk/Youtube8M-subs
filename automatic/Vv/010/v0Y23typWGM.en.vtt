00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.459
 and very personal 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.659
 the accused's jurors 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.750
 imagine a dozen equipped from the nautical clubs of the agglomeration 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.320
 dunkerquoise to fight friendly at the bottom of the pool 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.269
 Olympic 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.650

 the national society of rescue at sea makes a heterogeneous whole 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.520
 united by the passion for water and the desire to have fun the names of 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.290
 teams give away the spirit of the event 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.920
 the no worries the lifeboat the ch'tis petanque the rescuers of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 The great wall 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 or the palmer ninjas 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.700
 from the kick-off serious things started with relays 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.030
 if snorkeling a dragon can seem child's play 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.270
 in reality the legs are quickly put to the test and some swimmers 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.460
 encountered first difficulties 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.310
 so when it comes to playing the water carrier while walking deep in the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.980
 swimming pool 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.180
 it becomes a real ordeal 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 consequence the concession look 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 om 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.320
 this competition 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.890
 that looked like an intercity the pills for me drew a very 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 many public and underwater cameras broadcast on the screens 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 giants to permit nothing to miss the show 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.860
 it's not enough all look the important thing is to participate adaptation 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.960
 very free of the coubertin stone motto the club has therefore proposed to 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.190
 all audiences to test his abilities we learned by retaining his 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.730
 cheat was not possible because the finalists had to prove their 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.730
 performance the gold head in their fake a basin 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.339

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:30.449
 the red thread of the competition the two obstacle courses 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.519
 in each team had to cross 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.999
 quickly possible 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.879
 a series of obstacles 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 one over the other 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.070
 nothing less than my face and my legs 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.240
 the state use all their energy to reach the finish 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.349
 the tests will follow each other quickly if some lead to real 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.709
 puzzles 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.289
 like the pagoda game 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.389
 where competitors to decapitate a Chinese version of the principle 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.389
 archimedes 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.980
 the treasure hunt 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.739
 gave rise to a battle

 time to become olympic discipline in the future the techniques could vary 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.209
