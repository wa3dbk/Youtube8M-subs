feel comfortable with it and sometimes

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.890 
feel comfortable with it and sometimes

people<00:02:23.880> driving<00:02:24.690> for<00:02:24.870> them<00:02:24.930> definitely

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
people driving for them definitely

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.500 
people driving for them definitely
because<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:26.130> enhances<00:02:26.400> their<00:02:26.730> online<00:02:27.060> persona

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
because it enhances their online persona

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.910 
because it enhances their online persona
just<00:02:27.840> being<00:02:28.019> able<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> make<00:02:28.500> some<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.739> those

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
just being able to make some of those

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
just being able to make some of those
makes<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.850> cool<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.360> uncharted

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

territory<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.360> anything

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
territory and I think really anything

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.420 
territory and I think really anything
has<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.230> possibility<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.980> potential

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
has the possibility of the potential

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.800 
has the possibility of the potential
being<00:02:35.670> our<00:02:35.850> form<00:02:36.209> but<00:02:36.420> certainly<00:02:36.630> around

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
being our form but certainly around

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.270 
being our form but certainly around

making<00:03:15.410> still<00:03:16.010> pictures<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.760> would<00:03:16.880> make

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
making still pictures you would make

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.490 
making still pictures you would make
animated<00:03:17.420> pictures<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.110> they<00:03:18.170> would<00:03:18.290> just<00:03:18.410> go

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
animated pictures and they would just go

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.960 
animated pictures and they would just go

focus on we have a single graphic called

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.249 
focus on we have a single graphic called
Anna<00:04:59.430> sees<00:04:59.699> everything<00:04:59.909> she's<00:05:00.419> watching<00:05:00.990> the

and he doesn't even think about it so
like<00:05:14.610> we<00:05:14.879> get<00:05:15.029> to<00:05:15.150> learn<00:05:15.330> something<00:05:15.690> and

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
like we get to learn something and

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.350 
like we get to learn something and
watching<00:05:16.710> somebody<00:05:16.949> for<00:05:17.460> hours<00:05:17.879> on<00:05:17.969> end<00:05:18.029> while

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
watching somebody for hours on end while

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.779 
watching somebody for hours on end while
we<00:05:18.449> work<00:05:18.629> on<00:05:18.779> it<00:05:18.960> we<00:05:18.990> understand<00:05:19.949> them<00:05:20.219> it's<00:05:20.580> so

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
we work on it we understand them it's so

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.659 
we work on it we understand them it's so
voyeuristic<00:05:21.569> you<00:05:22.080> look<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.580> should

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
voyeuristic you look like you should

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.939 
voyeuristic you look like you should
look<00:05:23.909> away<00:05:24.210> but<00:05:24.270> then<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.199> watch<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:25.710> and

go the simplicity of it I feel is really
beautiful<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.199> we<00:05:32.039> see<00:05:32.250> it<00:05:32.400> as<00:05:32.580> an<00:05:32.940> evolution

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
beautiful and we see it as an evolution

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.269 
beautiful and we see it as an evolution
of<00:05:33.659> photography<00:05:34.469> if<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.800> think<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.069> all<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
of photography if you think of all the

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.399 
of photography if you think of all the
ways<00:05:35.430> that<00:05:35.460> photography<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.300> displayed<00:05:36.750> these

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
ways that photography is displayed these

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.899 
ways that photography is displayed these
are<00:05:37.589> areas<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:37.949> we<00:05:38.190> want<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.460> go<00:05:38.610> into

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
are areas that we want to go into

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.189 
are areas that we want to go into
there's<00:05:39.240> little<00:05:39.569> parts<00:05:39.839> of<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.050> are

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
there's little parts of it that are

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.499 
there's little parts of it that are
alive<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:40.949> can<00:05:41.099> choose<00:05:41.339> to<00:05:41.729> engage<00:05:42.089> in

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
alive and you can choose to engage in

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.899 
alive and you can choose to engage in
depth<00:05:42.810> into<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.500> art<00:05:43.680> or<00:05:44.069> you<00:05:44.159> can<00:05:44.339> choose<00:05:44.610> to

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
depth into the art or you can choose to

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.560 
depth into the art or you can choose to
just<00:05:45.060> glance<00:05:45.479> at<00:05:45.690> it<00:05:45.750> it's<00:05:45.990> the

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
just glance at it it's the

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.990 
just glance at it it's the
and<00:05:47.560> essentially<00:05:48.520> something<00:05:48.760> you'd<00:05:48.940> never

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
and essentially something you'd never

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000 
and essentially something you'd never
seen<00:05:49.270> before

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
seen before

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.200

in gifts I think once you get to that

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.550 
in gifts I think once you get to that
point<00:05:56.140> yeah

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
point yeah

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.830 
point yeah

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
changed and we've always seen moline get

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.180 
changed and we've always seen moline get
away<00:06:01.510> with<00:06:01.780> it's<00:06:02.170> fun<00:06:02.440> when<00:06:02.680> we<00:06:02.830> started

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
away with it's fun when we started

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.040

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
making these we were calling them and it

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.810 
making these we were calling them and it
may<00:06:05.140> adjust<00:06:05.290> but<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.220> was<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:06.430> much<00:06:06.550> more<00:06:06.760> than

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
may adjust but it was so much more than
