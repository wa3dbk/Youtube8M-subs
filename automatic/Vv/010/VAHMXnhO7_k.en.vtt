about this week's episode which is

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
about this week's episode which is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
probably one of the most minuscule

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
probably one of the most minuscule
things<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
things is I actually really like the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
blades of the birdcage I thought that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.540 
blades of the birdcage I thought that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
was really clever just to show how

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.970 
was really clever just to show how
absolutely<00:01:00.210> sharp<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.559> some<00:01:01.829> other

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
pretty decent episode of one piece

pretty decent episode of one piece
really<00:03:32.400> slow<00:03:32.700> in<00:03:32.730> some<00:03:33.150> parts<00:03:33.419> in<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
really slow in some parts in the

really slow in some parts in the
animation<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.200> artwork<00:03:34.500> was<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.130> little<00:03:35.579> wonky

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
animation in artwork was a little wonky

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.699 
animation in artwork was a little wonky
at<00:03:36.209> times<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.959> there<00:03:37.109> was<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.260> little<00:03:37.500> bit<00:03:37.620> of

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
at times and there was a little bit of

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.440 
at times and there was a little bit of
overuse<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.280> some<00:03:38.519> flashbacks<00:03:38.790> we<00:03:39.150> frankly

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
overuse of some flashbacks we frankly

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.509 
overuse of some flashbacks we frankly
just<00:03:39.630> didn't<00:03:39.959> need<00:03:40.049> to<00:03:40.169> see<00:03:40.349> but<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.310> still

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
just didn't need to see but this still

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.099

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
usually is and of course there's the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.759 
usually is and of course there's the
prospect<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.880> freaking<00:03:51.690> fujitora<00:03:52.200> showing<00:03:52.620> up
