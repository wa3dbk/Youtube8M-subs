this<00:01:01.710> account<00:01:02.070> sometime<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.489> doing<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this account sometime just doing it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.759 
this account sometime just doing it
naturally<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.570> think<00:01:04.170> that'd<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:04.530> sweet

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
naturally I think that'd be pretty sweet

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
naturally I think that'd be pretty sweet
but<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.400> continue<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> gemming<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.600> max

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
but we will continue this gemming to max

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.969 
but we will continue this gemming to max
base<00:01:07.650> series<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.119> seven<00:01:09.450> parts<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
base series I have it in seven parts of

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
base series I have it in seven parts of
240,000<00:01:10.979> gems<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.360> next<00:01:12.479> two<00:01:12.659> videos<00:01:12.780> are

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
240,000 gems so the next two videos are

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.060 
240,000 gems so the next two videos are
probably<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:13.799> bigger

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
probably going to be a little bit bigger

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.140 
probably going to be a little bit bigger
and<00:01:14.430> i<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:15.869> might<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.890> past<00:01:17.159> 140,000

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and i think i might go past 140,000

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
and i think i might go past 140,000
evans<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.170> honestly<00:01:19.560> thought<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
evans because I I honestly thought it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
evans because I I honestly thought it
would<00:01:19.979> only<00:01:20.100> take<00:01:20.420> 140,000<00:01:21.420> gems<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
would only take 140,000 gems to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
would only take 140,000 gems to
completely<00:01:22.140> max<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.560> base<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.369> guess

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
completely max on my base but I guess

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.130 
completely max on my base but I guess
it's<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.240> than<00:01:24.330> an<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.630> think<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
it's more than an you think about that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.160 
it's more than an you think about that
that's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> money<00:01:26.509> i'm<00:01:27.509> glad<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that's a lot of money i'm glad i got the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
that's a lot of money i'm glad i got the
sponsorship<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.070> i<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
sponsorship so i don't really have to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
sponsorship so i don't really have to
worry<00:01:30.420> anymore<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:32.220> we're<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.579> good<00:01:32.790> man

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.010 
towers I think they can wait guys people
say<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.789> makes<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:41.000> big<00:04:41.150> difference<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.660> doesn't

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
say it makes a big difference it doesn't

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.550 
say it makes a big difference it doesn't
damage<00:04:42.470> per<00:04:42.830> second<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.220> 250<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:45.260> builds

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
damage per second is 250 but that builds

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.140 
damage per second is 250 but that builds
up<00:04:45.710> over<00:04:45.889> time<00:04:46.070> it's<00:04:46.520> not<00:04:46.669> like<00:04:46.820> it's<00:04:47.000> right

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
up over time it's not like it's right

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.860 
up over time it's not like it's right
away<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:47.479> it's<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.800> damage<00:04:49.310> as<00:04:49.729> our<00:04:50.090> five

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
away so it's like to damage as our five

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870 
away so it's like to damage as our five
or<00:04:51.200> 10<00:04:51.440> damage<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.889> second<00:04:52.310> it's<00:04:52.430> not<00:04:52.550> like<00:04:52.729> it

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
think it's that important right now I

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.950 
think it's that important right now I
think<00:04:58.310> Tesla's<00:04:58.760> and<00:04:58.940> air<00:04:59.030> defenses<00:04:59.539> are<00:04:59.690> most

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
think Tesla's and air defenses are most

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.810 
think Tesla's and air defenses are most
important<00:05:00.380> maybe<00:05:00.500> my<00:05:00.710> archer<00:05:01.039> towers<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.520> and
