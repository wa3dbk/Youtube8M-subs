it up it uses XLR cables as an output
you<00:02:48.959> will<00:02:49.170> need<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> purchase<00:02:49.829> an<00:02:50.190> XLR<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.329> 3.5

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
you will need to purchase an XLR to 3.5

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.119 
you will need to purchase an XLR to 3.5
millimeter<00:02:53.269> wire<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.950> it

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
I will show you on the camcorder here

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.380 
I will show you on the camcorder here
what<00:03:07.890> happens<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> plug<00:03:08.790> in<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.030> receiver

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
what happens when I plug in the receiver

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.410 
what happens when I plug in the receiver
into<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.349> camcorder<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.099> start<00:03:11.909> using<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
into the camcorder and start using the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.599 
into the camcorder and start using the
wireless<00:03:12.659> mic<00:03:13.019> alright<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> little

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
wireless mic alright so this is a little

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.369 
wireless mic alright so this is a little
tricky<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> keep<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.329> frame<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> moment

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
tricky to keep in frame at the moment

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.289 
tricky to keep in frame at the moment
but<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.340> sitting<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.669> my<00:03:17.760> table<00:03:17.940> you<00:03:18.150> can

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
but it's sitting on my table you can

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.330 
but it's sitting on my table you can
kind<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.540> see<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.079> around<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:20.010> holiday

I turned on the receiver now I'm going

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.020 
I turned on the receiver now I'm going
to<00:04:07.590> put<00:04:07.829> on<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:08.250> transmitter

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
to put on the transmitter

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.390 
to put on the transmitter
and<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.079> see<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.349> mic<00:04:10.560> levels<00:04:10.980> have<00:04:11.220> come

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
and you can see the mic levels have come

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.689 
and you can see the mic levels have come
back<00:04:11.549> up<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:12.000> because<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:13.250> mic<00:04:14.250> which<00:04:14.519> I'm

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
back up that's because the mic which I'm

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.900 
back up that's because the mic which I'm
trying<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.060> float<00:04:15.720> there<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.519> is<00:04:17.699> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
trying to float there so that is the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.870 
trying to float there so that is the
lapel<00:04:18.329> mic<00:04:18.599> that<00:04:18.780> comes<00:04:19.019> with<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.530> mic<00:04:20.400> setup

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
lapel mic that comes with the mic setup

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.110 
lapel mic that comes with the mic setup
that<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.530> floating<00:04:22.530> around<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.820> as

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that I have floating around there and as
