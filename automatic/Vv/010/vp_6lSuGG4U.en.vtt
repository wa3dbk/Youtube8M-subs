00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.379 
people when they're first starting out
they'll<00:02:42.689> cut<00:02:42.870> their<00:02:43.049> dices<00:02:43.409> like<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:44.389> which

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
they'll cut their dices like this which

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.080 
they'll cut their dices like this which
is<00:02:45.540> absolutely<00:02:46.169> fine<00:02:46.439> but<00:02:47.189> as<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.669> see<00:02:47.879> it
