00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
this up to a boil now that this is up to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.440 
this up to a boil now that this is up to
a<00:02:37.840> boil<00:02:38.080> I'm<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.680> cook<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:40.300> about

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
a boil I'm going to cook this for about

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.250 
a boil I'm going to cook this for about
five<00:02:41.050> minutes<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.790> medium<00:02:43.090> high<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.750> I'm

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
five minutes on medium high and I'm

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.390 
five minutes on medium high and I'm
going<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.440> keep<00:02:44.560> stirring<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.070> because

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
going to keep stirring this because

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160 
going to keep stirring this because
there<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> butter<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.300> cream<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:46.990> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
there is butter and cream in this and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.630 
there is butter and cream in this and
you<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.410> not<00:02:47.560> want<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.130> burn

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you do not want it to burn

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.740 
you do not want it to burn
so<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.760> thought<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.180> by<00:02:52.300> freezing<00:02:52.570> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
so and I thought that by freezing the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.590 
so and I thought that by freezing the
kernels<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:54.640> it<00:02:54.880> would<00:02:55.000> have<00:02:55.120> an<00:02:55.209> effect<00:02:55.270> on

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
kernels that it would have an effect on

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.400 
kernels that it would have an effect on
this<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.080> really<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.530> doesn't<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.080> a

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
this but really it doesn't so and just a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.740 
this but really it doesn't so and just a
note<00:02:59.560> here<00:02:59.620> I<00:03:00.070> am<00:03:00.520> doing<00:03:00.730> half<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.180> recipe<00:03:01.510> I

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
note here I am doing half of a recipe I

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.320 
note here I am doing half of a recipe I
will<00:03:01.780> put<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.230> into<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.770> full<00:03:03.010> recipe<00:03:03.330> down

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
will put the into the full recipe down

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.260 
will put the into the full recipe down
below<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:04.989> description<00:03:05.110> box<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:07.030> while

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
below in the description box and while

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.479 
below in the description box and while
this<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.630> cooking<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.620> want<00:03:08.739> to<00:03:08.860> go<00:03:08.920> ahead<00:03:09.040> and

this and cooking it for at least a few
more<00:03:46.120> minutes<00:03:46.890> all<00:03:47.890> right<00:03:47.950> now<00:03:48.280> that<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.549> has

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
more minutes all right now that this has

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.699 
more minutes all right now that this has
been<00:03:48.790> going<00:03:48.850> for<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> few<00:03:49.540> minutes<00:03:49.810> I'm<00:03:50.590> going

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
been going for a few minutes I'm going

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.440 
been going for a few minutes I'm going
to<00:03:50.799> add<00:03:50.920> my<00:03:51.160> milk<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.700> cornstarch<00:03:52.540> mixture

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
to add my milk and cornstarch mixture

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.000 
to add my milk and cornstarch mixture
and<00:03:55.450> I'm<00:03:55.780> just<00:03:56.170> going<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.380> bring<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.650> up<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.860> a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
and I'm just going to bring this up to a

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.960 
and I'm just going to bring this up to a
boil<00:03:57.220> until<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:58.750> is<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.140> TEC<00:03:59.910> because<00:04:00.910> you

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
boil until it is the TEC because you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.920 
boil until it is the TEC because you
don't<00:04:01.120> really<00:04:01.209> need<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.540> cook<00:04:01.660> that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
don't really need to cook that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.930 
don't really need to cook that
cornstarch<00:04:02.230> if<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.799> are<00:04:02.920> using<00:04:03.130> flour<00:04:03.519> you

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
cornstarch if you are using flour you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.750 
cornstarch if you are using flour you
will<00:04:04.150> need<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.420> cook<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:06.190> another<00:04:06.280> minute

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
will need to cook it for another minute

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.920 
will need to cook it for another minute
or<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:08.350> get<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.590> flour<00:04:08.860> taste<00:04:09.190> out

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
or so just to get that flour taste out

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.600 
or so just to get that flour taste out
and<00:04:10.930> also<00:04:11.079> for<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.470> chance<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.980> flour<00:04:12.310> to

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
and also for a chance for the flour to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.759 
and also for a chance for the flour to
do<00:04:13.420> its<00:04:13.600> job<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:14.079> thicken<00:04:14.769> up<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:17.260> as<00:04:17.500> soon<00:04:17.650> as

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
do its job and thicken up so as soon as

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.640 
do its job and thicken up so as soon as
this<00:04:17.859> comes<00:04:18.010> up<00:04:18.220> to<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> boil<00:04:19.320> we<00:04:20.320> will<00:04:20.350> almost

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
this comes up to a boil we will almost

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.260 
this comes up to a boil we will almost
be<00:04:20.979> done

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.820 

all<00:04:24.270> right<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:24.810> back<00:04:25.080> up<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:26.540> boil

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
all right so that's back up to a boil

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.890 
all right so that's back up to a boil
pretty<00:04:28.830> dang<00:04:29.040> close<00:04:29.250> anyway<00:04:29.760> I'm<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.780> going
