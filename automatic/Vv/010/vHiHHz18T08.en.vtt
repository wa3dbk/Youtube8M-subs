00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello girls welcome back to my channel 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.620
 this is a video dedicated to mine 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.279
 hair routine 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 a little while ago I shot the make-up one 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:18.539
 daily and nothing we are here I see in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 some videos show how 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.669
 curl your hair with that technique 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.019
 of the elastic that video you like 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.269
 a lot and also many girls write to me 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.790
 that a very simple technique from volume 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.390
 to the hair without applying many 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.430
 products 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.430
 then I simply wish now 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 practically curl your hair 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.580
 together with you 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.340
 simply by creating waves 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.270
 So I collected to have taken the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.950
 first two strands now that I am 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.010
 growing your hair together a little 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.140
 to the mad joy with all these 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:01.920
 hairstyles etc. so I go to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.790
 take the first strand that I go aa 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 to form 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:21.030
 then release and this is formed 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:31.240
 kind of a da I don't go too far a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:36.730
 form it be careful not to burn yourself 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:42.820
 because these are sometimes awful 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:45.340
 plates I have the desire to buy the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.980
 just the one that makes the waves 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.050
 But I have to find a good one that 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.050
 obviously it has an affordable price 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 here with this other one 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.740
 in fact it really comes to form 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.780
 long then I show you how I do 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.200
 practically just the true effect e 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.200
 own 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.390
 ok this i follow with this technique 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.810
 then I head and then see you 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.630
 after that it is this technique I used it 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.500
 practically all over the hair 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:42.360
 then natively putting the arm 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.370
 from the liter and do not leave and there is not 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.340
 need to leave it so long 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:57.260
 the iron on the hair I make like one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:57.260
 tip of 20 first seconds 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 and here it is 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.230
 then I leave my subject 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.780
 out and go to work 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:48.150
 this last hair this was 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:51.450
 the last ok now this tuft here 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:56.530
 I still tend to leave it this way 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:59.170
 or even if you also want to create 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:04.330
 to him but also to create a wave we say 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:08.340
 on the tuft can also be done in 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.400
 this way here is practically 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.550
 making the iron spin a little 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.770
 this way then inside turn 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.350
 inside of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.880
 now what to do then then later 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:28.800
 having practically passed the plate 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:32.080
 and iron what I do I take this 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.020
 this is this brush 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.330
 practically of synthetic fibers with which 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.870
 I am finding myself very well and going to 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:45.150
 pass it to lower it on the hair 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.150
 softly this way 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.030
 to give more effect anyway 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.650
 natural as possible to create we are 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.540
 to remove the division that exists 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.020
 we also say this sweep also a 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:08.690
 effect a little more cotonato a ad 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:15.000
 apply downwards to www.co di lacquer 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:19.860
 so this way always creating here 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.130
 an effect like the other 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.970
 kind of a line technique a little more 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:28.770
 defined to the curl and I hope nothing 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.150
 this tutorial may have been 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.710
 useful and let's say lately they are a bit 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.720
 made for the waves i like them 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.850
 very much also because in any case having 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.130
 now a little longer hair can 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.330
 for a moment indulge a kiss to all of them 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.330
 how many bye bye
