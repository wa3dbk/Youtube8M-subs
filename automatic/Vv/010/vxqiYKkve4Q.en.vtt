00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
this is something that is set to be

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.230 
this is something that is set to be
fixed<00:04:54.949> on<00:04:55.039> the<00:04:55.159> newer<00:04:55.310> models<00:04:55.729> thanks<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.120> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
fixed on the newer models thanks to the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.390 
fixed on the newer models thanks to the
auto<00:04:56.780> shutoff<00:04:57.229> feature<00:04:57.349> that<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> Xbox<00:04:58.250> has

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
auto shutoff feature that the Xbox has

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.749 
auto shutoff feature that the Xbox has
basically<00:04:59.000> what<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.419> is<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.590> your<00:05:01.280> Xbox

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
basically what this is is that your Xbox

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.519 
basically what this is is that your Xbox
every<00:05:02.090> time<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.449> gets<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.659> that<00:05:02.870> point<00:05:02.930> where<00:05:03.500> I

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:03.529 
every time it gets to that point where I

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.519 
every time it gets to that point where I
can<00:05:03.770> where<00:05:04.099> it<00:05:04.310> can't<00:05:04.550> handle<00:05:04.849> too<00:05:05.389> much<00:05:05.569> heat

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
can where it can't handle too much heat

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.610 
can where it can't handle too much heat
I<00:05:06.710> guess<00:05:06.949> it<00:05:07.250> auto<00:05:08.180> shuts<00:05:08.479> off<00:05:08.689> so<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.439> shuts

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
I guess it auto shuts off so it shuts

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.980 
I guess it auto shuts off so it shuts
off<00:05:10.300> sometimes<00:05:11.300> you<00:05:11.419> won't<00:05:11.479> even<00:05:11.659> know<00:05:11.840> when

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
off sometimes you won't even know when

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.779 
off sometimes you won't even know when
it<00:05:12.050> shuts<00:05:12.229> off<00:05:12.439> but<00:05:12.919> if<00:05:13.129> it<00:05:13.310> does<00:05:13.460> shut<00:05:13.669> off

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
it shuts off but if it does shut off

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.999 
it shuts off but if it does shut off
it's<00:05:14.060> for<00:05:14.900> your<00:05:15.409> own<00:05:15.469> good

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009
