extension<00:02:18.820> at<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.540> shade<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.110> combination

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
extension at the shade the combination

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
extension at the shade the combination
of<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.830> shade<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.280> my<00:02:21.700> only<00:02:21.820> concern<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.330> is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
of the shade and my only concern is is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.470 
of the shade and my only concern is is
that<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:24.130> assume<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.240> not

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
that this I assume that this is not

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.790 
that this I assume that this is not
going<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.720> match<00:02:25.840> really<00:02:26.230> my<00:02:26.350> hair<00:02:26.560> length

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
going to match really my hair length

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.680 
going to match really my hair length
because<00:02:27.250> I've<00:02:27.520> compared<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> length<00:02:28.300> um<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
because I've compared the length um to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.530 
because I've compared the length um to
my<00:02:28.780> other<00:02:28.960> 24<00:02:29.500> inch<00:02:29.710> extensions<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:31.300> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
my other 24 inch extensions and this is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.820 
my other 24 inch extensions and this is
a<00:02:32.340> one<00:02:33.340> inch<00:02:33.610> shorter<00:02:34.300> than<00:02:34.330> my<00:02:34.720> other<00:02:34.990> 24<00:02:35.620> inch

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
a one inch shorter than my other 24 inch

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.030 
a one inch shorter than my other 24 inch
extension<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.700> also<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.750> ends<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.500> ends<00:02:38.890> are

extension and also the ends the ends are

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.520 
extension and also the ends the ends are
a<00:02:39.100> bit<00:02:39.580> wispy<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.600> thin<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.140> guys<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.470> see

a bit wispy and thin as you guys can see

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.400 
a bit wispy and thin as you guys can see
that<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.390> guys<00:02:43.510> know<00:02:43.570> my<00:02:44.050> hair<00:02:44.320> is
