pretty<00:02:17.340> decent<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.740> hold<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> here

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
pretty decent so you can hold it here

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.260 
pretty decent so you can hold it here
this<00:02:21.810> sharp<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.190> know<00:02:23.310> step<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> step

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
this sharp you know step like a step

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480 
this sharp you know step like a step
function<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> problem<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.430> is

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
function so this is not a problem it is

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.630 
function so this is not a problem it is
not<00:02:26.550> too<00:02:26.940> sharp<00:02:27.300> not<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.710> uncomfortable<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
not too sharp not like uncomfortable I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380 
not too sharp not like uncomfortable I
do<00:02:29.700> hold<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.180> here<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> problem<00:02:32.240> if<00:02:33.240> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
do hold it here so not a problem if you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.090 
do hold it here so not a problem if you
hold<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:33.900> also<00:02:34.080> there<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> problem

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
hold it here also there is not a problem

loaded it with a standard international

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.520 
loaded it with a standard international
converter<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.860> see<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:24.330> can't<00:03:24.570> see<00:03:24.660> maybe

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
converter so you see you can't see maybe

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.500 
converter so you see you can't see maybe
you<00:03:25.769> don't<00:03:25.950> yes<00:03:26.190> there's<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.580> feed<00:03:26.790> then<00:03:27.390> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
you don't yes there's the feed then it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.580 
you don't yes there's the feed then it
is<00:03:27.630> taking<00:03:27.930> out<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.640> okay<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.390> let's<00:03:30.630> try<00:03:30.780> some

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
is taking out so okay so let's try some

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.240 
is taking out so okay so let's try some
writing<00:03:33.680> first<00:03:34.680> focus<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.340> camera<00:03:35.780> yes<00:03:37.250> so

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
writing first focus the camera yes so

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.679 
writing first focus the camera yes so
the<00:03:38.450> pen<00:03:39.450> is

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:54.509 

because<00:03:44.689> still<00:03:47.500> ambition<00:03:50.049> black<00:03:53.170> precious

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
because still ambition black precious

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.250 
because still ambition black precious
raising<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.579> comes<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.150> number<00:03:56.719> of<00:03:56.750> finishes

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
raising it comes in a number of finishes

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.530 
raising it comes in a number of finishes
wouldn't<00:03:57.799> finish<00:03:57.950> bamboo<00:03:58.459> finish<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.450> is

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
wouldn't finish bamboo finish so this is

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.770 
wouldn't finish bamboo finish so this is
a<00:03:59.599> black<00:03:59.810> one<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.760> ink<00:04:02.030> is<00:04:04.150> Parker<00:04:05.920> clink

a black one and the ink is Parker clink
nib<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:09.519> broad<00:04:11.920> see<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.010> is<00:04:13.099> very<00:04:13.310> smooth<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:14.359> a

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
nib is broad see it is very smooth so a

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:34.650 
nib is broad see it is very smooth so a
little<00:04:14.689> fast<00:04:14.959> fading<00:04:15.200> let's<00:04:15.590> try

Scratchy very very smooth so yes it is a

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.320 
Scratchy very very smooth so yes it is a
very<00:04:47.140> nice<00:04:47.380> nib<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.550> pen<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.880> beautiful

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330
