00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.320
 I also wanted to dive in for you 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:15.219
 small mini christmas tutorial get 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.169
 ready to do some video and now 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.310
 I've just done something so spontaneously 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.119
 you for now and his son glitter 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.779
 found 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.880
 I do not know what that one 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.480
 i think dave is from mac 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.640
 I think that time with reflex gold 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.049
 or so I'm not sure but exactly 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.019
 where no name says it 

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:45.640
 I'll show you that will fall then 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.830
 not out there looks like that and yes 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.869
 I then spontaneously attacked 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.629
 because it fits very well, I think 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:57.070
 to my nail polish that's nkosi from s- 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.799
 e- and I wanted to finally think 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.460
 to face glitter try out the glamor 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.750
 I think I've never used and 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.399
 That's why I have it right now 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.159
 just quite brutally grabbed me something 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.570
 and make- up I hope you like it 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.259
 I sometimes ran it 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.679
 that's a little better 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.030
 I hope so you can see it 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:25.479
 it actually sparkles it's natural 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.920
 now that you probably 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.670
 not in the camera at all 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.409
 can see that 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.659
 but just when i was in the bathroom and 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.630
 how the hair was made and the light 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.689
 was a little different and is right 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.799
 sparkled, however , that is also true 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:44.380
 a bit down and I have one 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:47.409
 few leaves particles also in the face yes 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.670
 So if yours wants to know how I do that 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.670
 made or stays simple 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.110
 yes so then sees the finished variant 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.150
 airbus or variation japan a natural 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.400
 now I've tried myself too 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.190
 to do a few things as well 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.410
 sarah so red green 106 that in her 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.540
 Firstly, video had found is so pretty 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.180
 but with me that looks totally stupid 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:56.270
 So I have weapons again and 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:58.610
 Everything done as always on the lips 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:02.950
 I wear today there is on the eyes yes 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.240
 already so glittering, the lips now 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.520
 more discreet I had thought first 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.770
 also one of the owner of mac too 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.940
 also use such a mushroom but has 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.540
 I think it's a bit too much 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.580
 become 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.920
 that's why I have my well -tried 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.670
 who liked to be taken supreme 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:23.960
 lipstick from mac and just like that 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:27.380
 So I find the bit applied 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:33.800
 Simply the optimal lipstick colors 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:36.160
 for me it always goes and he feels 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.580
 So good on the lips 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.580
 I love that 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:48.360
 and I think that fits very well 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:50.600
 this color combination a miracle wonder 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.900
 from on and also nice Christmas party 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.570
 a lot of great things to eat and 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:00.230
 nice lot of rest and rest and that 

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:02.640
 she gets all the wonderful gifts 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:06.710
 and hope to see you next time 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.710
 video stays healthy and persisted
