alright<00:00:08.069> guys<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.610> just<00:00:08.820> did<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.150> test<00:00:09.510> with<00:00:09.690> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
alright guys I just did my test with the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.040 
alright guys I just did my test with the
corrosion<00:00:10.139> ex

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.980 

I<00:00:13.400> got<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.550> can<00:00:14.820> full<00:00:15.090> of<00:00:15.120> water

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.380 

the<00:00:18.990> speed<00:00:19.260> control<00:00:19.620> has<00:00:19.800> already<00:00:20.100> been<00:00:20.390> about

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the speed control has already been about

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.120 
the speed control has already been about
the<00:00:21.510> speed<00:00:21.720> control<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.320> receiver<00:00:22.800> has

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the speed control but the receiver has

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
the speed control but the receiver has
been<00:00:23.369> tested<00:00:23.850> as<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:24.750> there's<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
been tested as you can see there's a

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.940 
been tested as you can see there's a
little<00:00:25.140> shine<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.470> it

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.070 

Seaver<00:00:28.950> battery<00:00:29.279> plugged<00:00:29.520> in<00:00:30.080> batteries

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
Seaver battery plugged in batteries

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.880 
Seaver battery plugged in batteries
plugs<00:00:31.349> down<00:00:32.300> now<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.629> 27<00:00:34.170> AM<00:00:34.440> megahertz

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
plugs down now this is 27 AM megahertz

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.850 
plugs down now this is 27 AM megahertz
frequency<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.900> you<00:00:37.080> can<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.680> wheels

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
frequency and as you can see the wheels

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.420 
frequency and as you can see the wheels
will<00:00:38.070> move<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.430> bit<00:00:38.699> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> car

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.590 

trying<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.490> do<00:00:45.580> this<00:00:45.700> one-handed<00:00:46.030> fellows<00:00:46.480> to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
trying to do this one-handed fellows to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.940 
trying to do this one-handed fellows to
just<00:00:46.980> pardon<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.250> interruption<00:00:49.120> there<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
just pardon the interruption there and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.800 
just pardon the interruption there and
here<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.370> goes<00:00:51.400> now<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:55.060> car<00:00:55.330> may<00:00:55.480> tilts<00:00:55.780> a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
here it goes now the car may tilts a

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.770 
here it goes now the car may tilts a
little<00:00:56.050> bit<00:00:56.170> because<00:00:56.470> this<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.740> 27<00:00:57.280> am

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
little bit because this is a 27 am

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.260 
little bit because this is a 27 am
megahertz<00:00:58.780> frequency<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.520> in<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.820> water

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
megahertz frequency this is in the water

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.320 
megahertz frequency this is in the water
OOP<00:01:01.600> there<00:01:01.630> he<00:01:01.870> goes

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.490 

as<00:01:06.870> you<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.650> water<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:10.260> see

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
as you see it's in water and you see

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400 
as you see it's in water and you see
this<00:01:10.680> still<00:01:10.950> works<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.480> that's<00:01:12.480> 27<00:01:12.900> mega

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
this still works here that's 27 mega

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:24.289 
this still works here that's 27 mega
mega<00:01:13.680> Hertz<00:01:13.950> I've<00:01:14.220> taken<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.970> bit

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.999 

and<00:01:24.899> as<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:30.289> so<00:01:31.289> I'd<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.679> thank

like<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.399> come<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> server<00:01:38.850> wasn't<00:01:39.210> working

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
like how come the server wasn't working

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.260 
like how come the server wasn't working
while<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:40.020> receiver<00:01:40.979> was<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> water<00:01:41.729> like

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
while the receiver was on the water like

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.260 
while the receiver was on the water like
again<00:01:42.539> I<00:01:42.569> said<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.709> is<00:01:44.039> 27<00:01:44.670> megahertz<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.179> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
again I said this is 27 megahertz it is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.959 
again I said this is 27 megahertz it is
not<00:01:45.420> 2.4<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:46.799> been<00:01:46.920> 2.4<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.819> would

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
not 2.4 that there's been 2.4 it would

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
not 2.4 that there's been 2.4 it would
have<00:01:48.090> been<00:01:48.209> working<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.479> again<00:01:57.959> once<00:01:58.799> again

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
have been working and again once again

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.899 
have been working and again once again
erosion<00:01:59.610> eggs

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
erosion eggs

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.130 
erosion eggs
that's<00:02:00.179> product<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.720> there<00:02:00.929> for

that's product out there for

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:25.089 
that's product out there for
waterproofing<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.039> electronics

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099
