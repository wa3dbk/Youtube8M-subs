00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.340
 Hello everyone, welcome a new one 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.920
 video today let's see how he did it 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 mainly a quadricopter in 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.939
 this case we have a f450 that would be 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.140
 the name of the frame because it is 45 long 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:37.239
 centimeters this quadcopter the bone 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.649
 ungrateful mainly because I needed it 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.489
 let's say something to shoot 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.700
 from above 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.030
 then I thought a plane wasn't because it goes 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.260
 too fast and I thought with drone 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.690
 this throne and here it has cost me 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.429
 roughly 500 euros and the most thing 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
 expensive are the engines that are of the 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.699
 mister 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.519
 obviously this is the brand has less 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.180
 expensive fascist went louigi others 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.370
 most famous brands say these engines 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.540
 here are all four thousand kv 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.320
 paid 60 euros and are managed by the desks 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.150
 who take the load unload of 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.800
 engines as it is very heavy ever 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.260
 refused by these baits they take 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.830
 the current from the battery 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.700
 the battery that is here is a zip from 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:33.020
 4000 miles per and then 4 amps 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.680
 let's say the engines are nice 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.480
 they must be chosen based on the weight of the model 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 and the benefits you want to have 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.730
 in my case we want performance 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.159
 so quiet flight for it 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.619
 stabilizer 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 these engines were fine here 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:58.750
 the control unit now we see is a kk 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 2.1.5 it seems to me that he is of the aob king 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.990
 who is doing it has been realized 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.689
 I bought it from the king lobby 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.369
 on her it seems to me 40 euros 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.000
 then the batteries as I said before 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.260
 they are four ampere and 20 c dump 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.549
 I paid them around thirty euros each 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.500
 so I am two tired and here for the 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:28.180
 shipping for 10 euros and both I have 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:30.190
 you pay 60 euros or 70 I don't remember and then to 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.620
 nice central we said is about 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.190
 thirty the engines are all four 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.480
 out of 60 and ex that other 60 then i 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.310
 engines and desks all for 120 euros 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.930
 I got the stabilizer from China 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.090
 because here in Europe it really costs 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.790
 very much and paid him like 56 euros 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.900
 free shipping which among other things 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.810
 I did n't even pay the customs because 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.480
 customs are not always paid from China 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:07.150
 then we see which ones we have a buzzer 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.739
 which often sounds just the battery 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.419
 it is running down because I was there if 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.900
 they go down three times per cell 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:17.680
 they die so we play them from here 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.930
 we have the fair receiver on 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.819
 radio control which is four channels 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.340
 I can give you if I can direct you 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.250
 I highly recommend it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.290
 this control unit if you want 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.280
 but let's say good value for money 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.780
 price 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.200
 because this unit is completely 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.440
 programmable, suitable for 8 cooked esa 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.020
 Cotter the quadcopter tricoptera also 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.280
 I think airplanes and I said it's totally 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.660
 programmable because inside 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.360
 we can decide the configuration i 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.790
 sensor settings because this 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.680
 control unit to the accelerometer sensors 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.950
 gyroscope and magnetometer seem to me one 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.240
 net 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.800
 maybe not and by configuring we decide 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.970
 how you must respond to the various movements 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.890
 however on this matter there are 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.880
 lots of videos if you don't know what the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.520
 pid 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040
 I advise you to find out why it is 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.690
 fundamental for a quadricopter that it is 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.579
 stability 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.870
 then we have ten propellers 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.270
 for 4.5 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.100
 and ok, leli that are recommended 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.320
 together engines so follow what 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.880
 the seller says 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:37.840
 then we have the cart that served me 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:40.180
 to raise the stabilizer now vi 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.390
 I'll show you a video you made in 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.610
 mountain with this quadricopter and how 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.870
 filming came 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.680
 I tell you right away that I resume with one 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.840
 copro hero iii more silver that resumes at 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.450
 1080 and sixty frames 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.450
 so just it was not well enough 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.260
 now you have seen the difference between it 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.240
 stabilizer is always a recovery 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.410
 without stabilizer 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.690
 in short for 60 50 euros it is really worth the 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.930
 punishment 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:09.650
 then if you want a quadricopter there 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:13.340
 via more performance or with a gps a 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.580
 FPV system I recommend you to pass the 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.620
 nasa dj nasa control unit which is one 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.590
 control unit that has integrated GPS and 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.960
 so you can set it for yourself 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.780
 have him return home automatically 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.720
 just lose the signal or by pressing 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.850
 a key with regard to the 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.080
 system in effect v or the view in 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:39.680
 first person with glasses or one 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.810
 screen on what i'm still 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.120
 working and I would like as soon as possible 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.370
 to be able to do it 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.780
 let's say we need another 200 euros 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:53.200
 because the transmitting antennas of the 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.350
 video signal they take from the body 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.980
 it costs about 50 euros what 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.620
 It costs more 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.620
 the screen glasses the chiello also 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.840
 up to 300 euros i carl zeiss 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:09.520
 or factures that cost a little 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.150
 less but the video quality of the ftvs is not 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.650
 of the best 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.480
 however I advise you to inform yourself 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:19.940
 also on this and if you are interested to know 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.640
 other things on any quadcopter 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.790
 other how to program the pid qua also 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.260
 if there are many guides, English 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:31.160
 let me know in the comments it is served 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.990
 you liked leave a nice like 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.030
 so if you want to have others 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.640
 information write that I will do the most 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.440
 soon another video 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.510
 now I'll show you a picture that 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.980
 full quadcopter with the gopro 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:48.340
 attacked and the lights I put underneath 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:52.090
 which I momentarily detached because 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:53.750
 are these here is a led strip 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.430
 voluntarily or detached because 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.040
 in short, consumption 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.380
 the stabilizer is not excessive 

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.920
 but saving on the LED strip either 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.920
 a little more autonomy 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.840
 all right then see you in the next 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.410
 video 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.410
 Hi everyone
