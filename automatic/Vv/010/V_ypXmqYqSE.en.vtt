00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.090
 in the world looking alam bought one of these 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.200
 cars 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.060
 Chevrolet Camaro for 28 1969 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.359
 a little auto archeology allows 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.679
 find out what makes this camaro unique 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.980
 lot of tax I want to erase a little 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.810
 I hope to see the original in this place 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 Colour 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.419
 35 water intake paint visible primer about 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.169
 exchanging blue color outflow of deposits judging by 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.110
 everything this car was ever stronger 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.500
 with the difference that it seemed that I think 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.260
 what is this dark blue flag 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.540
 the original will bear what to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.570
 alcohol is why this car is unique 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.810
 Caracas 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 I am an honest shalayev 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.719
 you first need to clean the body 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.729
 so the head of the metal to find all 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.729
 rusted ground 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.270
 special tour under great pressure 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.620
 It is considered the body layers of paint and putty 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 exposing rusted areas 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 very quickly detected 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 unpleasant surprise 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.840
 during handicraft repairs in the seventies 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 years damaged body parts 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.980
 replaced by metal 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.500
 sheets 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
 in Samara, someone riveted court sheets 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.450
 metal and it was not worth doing 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 As a rule, I was hoping that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 will be better than Isaev’s expectations then now I’m 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.930
 try some whom I sure wheel arches 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 Russian historians lower meters 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.450
 Kovalenko all this all the time something new 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 were know how to go 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.280
 this decision is one 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.280
 homemade plot needs to be replaced 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.630
 understand and czech chisels in hands 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.220
 wizard easily copes with 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.220
 riveted sheet metal 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.710
 But this means that Alona will have to 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.330
 put new rear side panels 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.890
 unexpected and unpleasant 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.879
 additional expenses
