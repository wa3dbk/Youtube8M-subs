more<00:04:25.960> rock<00:04:26.110> shot<00:04:26.440> there<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.830> one<00:04:26.950> was<00:04:27.160> worthy

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
more rock shot there that one was worthy

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.330 
more rock shot there that one was worthy
of<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.240> week<00:04:28.480> in<00:04:28.720> world<00:04:28.960> attention<00:04:29.560> but<00:04:30.010> it's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
of this week in world attention but it's

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.250 
of this week in world attention but it's
made<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.790> Chaffee<00:04:31.000> brick<00:04:31.210> instead<00:04:31.600> so

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
made it to Chaffee brick instead so

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.930 
made it to Chaffee brick instead so
that's<00:04:32.830> really<00:04:33.010> how<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.250> think<00:04:33.460> use<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.700> jump

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
that's really how you think use the jump

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700 
that's really how you think use the jump
and<00:04:34.060> get<00:04:34.210> someone<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.510> tick<00:04:34.840> their<00:04:35.200> attention

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
and get someone to tick their attention

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.170 
and get someone to tick their attention
away<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.190> then<00:04:36.430> we<00:04:36.610> need<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:36.760> circle<00:04:37.150> around

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
away and then we need to circle around

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.210 
away and then we need to circle around
behind<00:04:37.690> them<00:04:37.870> after<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.290> plunge<00:04:38.530> attempt<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
behind them after the plunge attempt and

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.890 
behind them after the plunge attempt and
get<00:04:39.790> some<00:04:39.940> hits<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.240> them<00:04:40.390> so<00:04:40.510> while<00:04:40.690> he's

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
get some hits on them so while he's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.560 
get some hits on them so while he's
focusing<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.830> l-man<00:04:42.430> here<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.090> other<00:04:43.270> Chaffee

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
focusing on l-man here the other Chaffee

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.950 
focusing on l-man here the other Chaffee
comes<00:04:43.810> up<00:04:43.960> from<00:04:44.140> behind<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.770> mops<00:04:45.310> him

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
comes up from behind and mops him

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.750 
comes up from behind and mops him
Wow<00:04:47.960> amazing<00:04:48.770> shot<00:04:49.010> they're<00:04:49.190> able<00:04:49.340> to<00:04:49.490> take

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
Wow amazing shot they're able to take

Wow amazing shot they're able to take
him<00:04:49.940> out<00:04:50.120> on<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.690> move

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
him out on the move

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.830 
him out on the move
then<00:04:52.790> this<00:04:53.000> spot<00:04:53.180> out<00:04:53.210> the<00:04:53.390> enemy's<00:04:53.660> artillery

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
then this spot out the enemy's artillery

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.630 
then this spot out the enemy's artillery
so<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.470> isn't<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.770> good<00:04:54.920> position<00:04:55.250> for<00:04:55.580> the

finishes<00:05:51.150> off<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.630> the<00:05:51.780> hill<00:05:52.139> so<00:05:52.970> in<00:05:53.970> hindsight

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
finishes off of the hill so in hindsight

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.969 
finishes off of the hill so in hindsight
actually<00:05:54.690> thinking<00:05:54.960> about<00:05:55.080> it<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.560> enemy<00:05:55.680> has

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
actually thinking about it the enemy has

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.600 
actually thinking about it the enemy has
four<00:05:57.050> tanks<00:05:58.050> left<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.620> are<00:05:58.830> unaccounted<00:05:59.580> for

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
four tanks left that are unaccounted for

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.790 
four tanks left that are unaccounted for
the<00:06:00.240> were<00:06:00.449> an<00:06:00.660> account<00:06:00.900> before<00:06:01.199> at<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.560> time

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
the were an account before at the time

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.589 
the were an account before at the time
so<00:06:02.370> all<00:06:02.400> four<00:06:02.880> of<00:06:02.910> those<00:06:03.150> could<00:06:03.389> have<00:06:03.419> been

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
so all four of those could have been

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:05.060 
so all four of those could have been
gone<00:06:03.690> for<00:06:03.900> a<00:06:03.930> base<00:06:04.080> capture<00:06:04.440> so<00:06:04.590> if<00:06:04.650> I<00:06:04.770> were<00:06:04.889> to

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
gone for a base capture so if I were to

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.189 
gone for a base capture so if I were to
Chappy's<00:06:05.490> here<00:06:05.669> started<00:06:06.419> a<00:06:06.449> base<00:06:06.599> capture<00:06:07.020> and

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
Chappy's here started a base capture and

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.540 
Chappy's here started a base capture and
then<00:06:07.289> he<00:06:07.380> only<00:06:07.590> started<00:06:07.830> a<00:06:07.949> base<00:06:08.070> captured<00:06:08.430> not

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
then he only started a base captured not

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.900 
then he only started a base captured not
long<00:06:08.699> after<00:06:09.060> as<00:06:09.240> they<00:06:09.479> have<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:10.639> their<00:06:11.639> timer

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
long after as they have the their timer

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.990 
long after as they have the their timer
would<00:06:12.150> have<00:06:12.240> went<00:06:12.389> up<00:06:12.479> significantly<00:06:12.630> faster

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
would have went up significantly faster

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.600 
would have went up significantly faster
they<00:06:15.000> would<00:06:15.210> have<00:06:15.330> lost<00:06:15.509> again<00:06:16.460> yeah<00:06:17.460> they

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
they would have lost again yeah they

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.920 
they would have lost again yeah they
would<00:06:17.729> have<00:06:17.820> lost<00:06:17.940> as<00:06:18.180> much<00:06:18.330> as<00:06:18.570> the<00:06:18.780> two

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
would have lost as much as the two

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.839 
would have lost as much as the two
Chaffey's<00:06:19.320> would<00:06:19.500> have<00:06:19.740> been<00:06:19.979> out<00:06:20.220> capped<00:06:20.550> by

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.849 
Chaffey's would have been out capped by

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.900 
Chaffey's would have been out capped by
the<00:06:21.240> remaining<00:06:22.199> tanks<00:06:22.590> not<00:06:23.370> in<00:06:23.550> that<00:06:23.699> the<00:06:23.789> are

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910

the remaining tanks not in that the are
all<00:06:24.090> coming<00:06:24.479> but<00:06:24.690> they<00:06:24.870> could<00:06:25.169> have<00:06:25.380> been<00:06:25.530> so

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
all coming but they could have been so

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.640 
all coming but they could have been so
they're<00:06:26.940> Hummel<00:06:27.300> was<00:06:27.479> able<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:27.960> take<00:06:28.199> out<00:06:28.409> the

guy<00:06:28.889> that<00:06:29.099> was<00:06:29.220> facing<00:06:29.580> off<00:06:29.669> against<00:06:30.030> them

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
guy that was facing off against them

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.060 
guy that was facing off against them
since<00:06:30.240> you'll<00:06:30.510> see<00:06:30.690> who<00:06:30.900> is<00:06:31.169> in

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
since you'll see who is in

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.950 
since you'll see who is in
who<00:06:33.520> was<00:06:33.640> in<00:06:33.760> the<00:06:33.880> biz<00:06:34.000> capturing<00:06:34.660> and<00:06:34.870> it

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
who was in the biz capturing and it

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.230 
who was in the biz capturing and it
looks<00:06:35.140> like<00:06:35.200> it's<00:06:35.500> this<00:06:35.680> tiger<00:06:36.190> tank<00:06:36.430> here

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.730 

looks<00:06:40.240> like<00:06:40.300> he's<00:06:40.510> just<00:06:40.540> gonna<00:06:40.810> back<00:06:41.110> off<00:06:41.350> and

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
looks like he's just gonna back off and

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.430 
looks like he's just gonna back off and
try<00:06:42.040> and<00:06:42.430> angle<00:06:43.060> his<00:06:43.210> front<00:06:43.540> armor<00:06:43.870> towards

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
try and angle his front armor towards

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.340 
try and angle his front armor towards
where<00:06:45.220> was<00:06:45.400> getting<00:06:45.670> shot<00:06:45.970> through

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
where was getting shot through

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.400 
where was getting shot through
unfortunately<00:06:47.350> it<00:06:47.440> looks<00:06:47.560> like<00:06:48.480> able<00:06:49.480> to<00:06:50.170> land

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
unfortunately it looks like able to land

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.070 
unfortunately it looks like able to land
a<00:06:50.710> shot<00:06:51.130> and<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.580> other<00:06:51.610> Chaffee<00:06:52.060> comes<00:06:52.840> in

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
a shot and the other Chaffee comes in

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.800 
a shot and the other Chaffee comes in
from<00:06:53.320> the<00:06:53.350> side<00:06:53.620> to<00:06:53.830> take<00:06:53.980> his<00:06:54.220> attention<00:06:54.640> away

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
from the side to take his attention away

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.150 
from the side to take his attention away
probably<00:06:55.810> a<00:06:55.960> bit<00:06:56.080> of<00:06:56.140> a<00:06:56.200> mistake<00:06:56.380> running<00:06:57.010> in

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
probably a bit of a mistake running in

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.140 
probably a bit of a mistake running in
there<00:06:57.340> but<00:06:57.550> did<00:06:58.090> manage<00:06:58.360> to<00:06:58.800> draw<00:06:59.800> the<00:07:00.220> the<00:07:00.940> tag

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
there but did manage to draw the the tag

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.510 
there but did manage to draw the the tag
attacks<00:07:01.480> fire<00:07:01.810> while<00:07:02.200> the<00:07:02.620> other<00:07:02.920> Chaffee<00:07:03.370> is

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
attacks fire while the other Chaffee is

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.510 
attacks fire while the other Chaffee is
able<00:07:04.000> to<00:07:04.240> him<00:07:04.510> out<00:07:04.780> so<00:07:05.770> now<00:07:05.920> it's<00:07:06.100> just<00:07:06.280> the

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
able to him out so now it's just the

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.490 
able to him out so now it's just the
Hummel<00:07:06.880> and<00:07:07.030> this<00:07:07.360> very<00:07:07.690> beetle<00:07:08.110> Chaffee

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
Hummel and this very beetle Chaffee

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.490 
Hummel and this very beetle Chaffee
against<00:07:08.980> what<00:07:09.190> is<00:07:09.370> a<00:07:09.550> kv-3<00:07:10.300> which<00:07:10.900> was<00:07:11.170> last

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
against what is a kv-3 which was last

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.380 
against what is a kv-3 which was last
spotted<00:07:11.740> in<00:07:12.070> the<00:07:12.490> center<00:07:12.910> of<00:07:13.000> the<00:07:13.060> map<00:07:13.210> so<00:07:13.360> to

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
spotted in the center of the map so to

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.030 
spotted in the center of the map so to
speed<00:07:13.840> this<00:07:14.050> up<00:07:14.260> until<00:07:14.470> the<00:07:14.650> action<00:07:14.920> kicks

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.040 
speed this up until the action kicks

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.620 
speed this up until the action kicks
back<00:07:15.250> off<00:07:15.370> again<00:07:15.490> so<00:07:16.180> gonna<00:07:16.300> have<00:07:16.450> to<00:07:16.570> be

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
back off again so gonna have to be

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.060 
back off again so gonna have to be
pretty<00:07:16.780> careful<00:07:17.020> because<00:07:17.320> a<00:07:17.440> Chaffee<00:07:17.800> 1<00:07:17.980> on

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070 
pretty careful because a Chaffee 1 on

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.640 
pretty careful because a Chaffee 1 on
wall<00:07:18.280> you<00:07:18.310> might<00:07:18.610> be<00:07:18.880> a<00:07:18.910> match<00:07:19.180> for<00:07:19.210> a<00:07:19.720> kb3<00:07:20.440> of

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
wall you might be a match for a kb3 of

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.980 
wall you might be a match for a kb3 of
course<00:07:20.950> but<00:07:21.850> at<00:07:22.030> a<00:07:22.060> distance<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.660> here<00:07:22.810> being

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
course but at a distance to here being

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.810 
course but at a distance to here being
through<00:07:23.200> definitely<00:07:23.650> has<00:07:23.830> the<00:07:24.040> advantage<00:07:24.580> and

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:24.820 
through definitely has the advantage and

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.269 
through definitely has the advantage and
especially<00:07:25.240> with<00:07:25.360> only<00:07:25.920> 100

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:27.279 
especially with only 100

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:30.449 
especially with only 100
and<00:07:27.759> 70<00:07:28.449> hit<00:07:28.689> points<00:07:29.079> so<00:07:29.649> probably<00:07:30.069> good<00:07:30.219> idea

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:30.459 
and 70 hit points so probably good idea

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.159 
and 70 hit points so probably good idea
to<00:07:30.699> try<00:07:30.819> and<00:07:30.909> spot<00:07:31.149> this<00:07:31.299> guy<00:07:31.479> on<00:07:31.659> or<00:07:31.929> he's<00:07:32.049> only

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:32.169 
to try and spot this guy on or he's only
