00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.340
 to the Ministry of Health but then yes 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.200
 accommodates giandonato here which is one of the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.300
 players who have in commentary 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.100
 called sportube my own more 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.140
 favorably impressed because not 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.780
 it was possible you can't updated 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.710
 have forgotten how to play at 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.960
 football 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.340
 obviously when they occur 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.289
 a series of circumstances in a 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.260
 championship had been a heated yes 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.720
 also risks losing the moment a 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.000
 trust because maybe that's what a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.190
 this point serves no because in short, the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.409
 feet there are personality to head 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.050
 high so what is missing 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:40.929
 let's look at it in a positive way but me 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.239
 I'm an optimist by nature so I have it 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.739
 always looked at positively I always have 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.870
 thought it would come to mine 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.559
 chance and I would have exploited it and today I think 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.209
 that was the one I say that up to 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.109
 today 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:58.659
 maybe I missed the condition 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.619
 put it this way because optimal physical 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.720
 however, it has been three or four years since 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:07.420
 I don't do a pre-season retreat 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.150
 being 188 for 80 kg 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.360
 I come to have difficulties in the first 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.460
 part of the season maybe with the time 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.280
 with the continuity of starting a thing 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.500
 which may I could compensate in this way 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.360
 however at the beginning it was not like this e 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
 so I gave my best in all 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.080
 workouts and today has arrived 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.620
 the opportunity made me ready 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.820
 this we tried to unpack 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.650
 we tried to undo menichini but 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.330
 it cannot be expressed on the individual but me 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 I believe we said today giandonato 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.400
 with his yes that is with franc in short 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 among the important notes in key 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.970
 as a problem colombo we are not 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.320
 often seeing at work in the league 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.810
 pro among known important in key 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.350
 there is also a league for the series 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.090
 then this numbered giandonato can 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.680
 say why then one of the things that is you 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 been read of giandonato that is feet 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.799
 good good games but does not defend but 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.829
 many times the fact that a person 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.600
 he says maybe that player doesn't defend 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.369
 because maybe he doesn't slip and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.349
 because maybe it doesn't make the contrast because 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.420
 maybe he doesn't jump out of his mind but I believe 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.030
 that the defense of one's door is 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.920
 even I close the trajectories not to be done 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.720
 never skip one on one 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.340
 maybe not but regain a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.709
 ball one made an excellent match 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.599
 on defense and therefore if name is 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.629
 simplistic to say giandonato does not know 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.849
 I certainly say defending it 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.739
 surely there is definitely a gap 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.630
 already born must improve dynamism 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.880
 must improve the defensive phase 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.410
 day to improve many things though 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.160
 does not know how to defend it seems to me a little 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.280
 exaggerated 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.049
 and then I wanted to ask you why this one 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.629
 metamorphosis a footballer like you who is 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.000
 was really was and that in my opinion 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:49.030
 I think they really are a soccer player 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.340
 important for football fails to 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.660
 have continuity in the course of his 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.140
 seasons 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.250
 I have had an examination of mine for some years 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.079
 I think I don't play the role a little 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 favor me the most because anyway 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.370
 a coach is always hard to trust 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.069
 of a young boy in an area 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.000
 delicate of the field in fact if you see between 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.930
 series a and series b 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.019
 there are 12 players of 20 21 22 23 24 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 years that play with continuity in a 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.150
 so delicate role 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.240
 I think this is a bit for you with 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.070
 done that 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.060
 football is going further 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.090
 physical condition is thought to much 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.710
 dynamism to physical strength so yes 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.260
 tends to put more in front of the defense 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.790
 a player with more quantities 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.680
 maybe the quality player is 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 move half-exposed thus a half 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.500
 tip or aim to play with 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.130
 higher quality players on 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.310
 external 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.290
 I think I have demonstrated today 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 being able to play but I was convinced of it 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.100
 also very well with manolo pestrin 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 when one piece came in also 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.610
 maybe the game was already in the channel was 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.950
 already channeled for the better 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.360
 but I believe that 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.459
 go we are two players who have 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.040
 different features I didn't want to tell you 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.750
 what I think we were also 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.730
 bad in quotes because hardly 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.800
 we have seen but new these 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.260
 warm up we said giandonato sta 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.609
 never seen playing but new bad 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.320
 warm up you can see us that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.299
 the coach changes me and so you have 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.930
 played much better than when he had 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.660
 started as a giandonato today has us 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.180
 impressed because in short from the beginning 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.610
 of the head match was distributed 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.440
 balls with personality in short does not have 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.150
 afraid of making a mistake 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.280
 because usually these matches 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.169
 I said before the coach is of little use 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.180
 because they don't matter much though if 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.100
 you lose or hurt then it is criticized e 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.900
 Accept processes that is not 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.919
 then this happened to him Giandonato 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.139
 stream to warm up to get him out 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.760
 absolutely pestrin and tell the truth 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.410
 if I had seen pestrin I would have 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.930
 absolutely think of the coach but 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.120
 would have saved for Sunday then 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.590
 I am optimistic 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.889
 giandonato is a candidate for the championship 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.710
 I hope to be there even though I like it 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.639
 more when he is in the middle of the field and not from 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.229
 inside, however, it is clear that there then 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.550
 what he says then takes over 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.620
 learn to protect the defense too 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.990
 because then that is the limit maybe the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.539
 person and soul said i'm not that i can 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.810
 always to have a player who a head 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.550
 high for play like the pendulum not before 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.979
 on the right, then on the left, please 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.780
 having seen a recovered soccer player 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.370
 no no it is important to trust a 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.720
 giandonato this I wanted to know also 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.970
 fans in short I made a good one 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.680
 match thanks thanks to giandonato a 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.680
 next still we close here
