most favorite devices ever used ever in
fact<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> top<00:00:38.579> devices

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
of 2014 I'm expecting great things from

of 2014 I'm expecting great things from
the<00:00:41.610> next<00:00:41.850> version<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> HTC<00:00:42.660> One<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> I'm

the next version of the HTC One so I'm

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.410 
the next version of the HTC One so I'm
going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.730> giving<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> whole<00:00:45.149> bunch<00:00:45.270> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
going to giving you a whole bunch of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.760 
going to giving you a whole bunch of
reasons<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> why<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.110> plastic<00:00:46.649> is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
reasons as to why I think plastic is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
reasons as to why I think plastic is
better<00:00:46.980> than<00:00:47.160> metal<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.450> I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
better than metal not because I'm

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
better than metal not because I'm
dashing<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.200> metal<00:00:49.440> phones<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.950> said<00:00:50.160> but

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
dashing on metal phones like I said but

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
dashing on metal phones like I said but
I<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.460> find<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.059> plastic<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> better<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I just find that plastic is better I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.470 
I just find that plastic is better I
find<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> metal<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.460> impractical<00:00:54.090> for

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
find that metal is very impractical for

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.650 
find that metal is very impractical for
a<00:00:54.750> phone<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.590> better<00:00:55.770> plastic<00:00:56.399> but

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
a phone it's much better plastic but

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.029 
a phone it's much better plastic but
watch<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> video<00:00:58.079> judge<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.469> yourself<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
watch the video judge for yourself and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.810 
watch the video judge for yourself and
then<00:00:59.190> let<00:00:59.370> me<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.730> think

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
then let me know what you think

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.520 
then let me know what you think
afterwards<00:01:00.359> let's<00:01:00.840> start<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> strength

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
afterwards let's start with the strength

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
afterwards let's start with the strength
of<00:01:01.680> material<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.520> find<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> weird

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of material I actually find it weird

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.520 
of material I actually find it weird
that<00:01:03.329> people<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.719> think<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> buying<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that people actually think that buying a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219 
that people actually think that buying a
metal<00:01:04.799> device<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.790> make<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.450> more<00:01:06.750> resistant

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
metal device will make it more resistant

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
metal device will make it more resistant
to<00:01:07.320> damage<00:01:07.500> most<00:01:08.040> practically<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> course

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to damage most practically of course

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.300 
to damage most practically of course
dropping<00:01:09.630> our<00:01:09.720> device<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.680> screen<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> a

dropping our device the screen on a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
dropping our device the screen on a
smartphone<00:01:11.820> tends<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> take<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.689> almost<00:01:12.930> half

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
smartphone tends to take up almost half

smartphone tends to take up almost half
the<00:01:13.830> surface<00:01:14.100> space<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.180> once<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.479> drop<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
the surface space so once you drop in it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
the surface space so once you drop in it
lands<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> screen<00:01:16.860> your<00:01:17.130> device<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> gone

lands on the screen your device is gone
no<00:01:18.210> matter<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.810> plastic<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.380> metal<00:01:19.500> this

no matter if it's plastic or metal this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
no matter if it's plastic or metal this
is<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> reason<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> hate<00:01:21.330> drop<00:01:21.630> test

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
is actually the reason I hate drop test

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.499 
is actually the reason I hate drop test
videos<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.680> smartphones<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> why<00:01:24.210> people

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
videos for smartphones and why people

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
videos for smartphones and why people
ask<00:01:24.600> me<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> lot<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> times<00:01:25.320> hey<00:01:25.530> why<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
ask me a lot of times hey why don't you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
ask me a lot of times hey why don't you
do<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> drop<00:01:26.220> test<00:01:26.369> video<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:27.150> why<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.509> small

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
do a drop test video that's why it small

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.149 
do a drop test video that's why it small
most<00:01:28.020> impractical<00:01:28.350> things<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
most impractical things you can do

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
most impractical things you can do
because<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> screen<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.060> gone<00:01:30.240> it's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because once the screen is gone it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
because once the screen is gone it's
gone<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.619> topic<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.100> resistant<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> damage

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
gone on the topic of resistant to damage

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.670 
gone on the topic of resistant to damage
I<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.900> metal<00:01:34.229> phones<00:01:34.409> are

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
I have to say that metal phones are

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.370 
I have to say that metal phones are
prone<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.340> scratching<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.970> crazy<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:37.290> on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
prone to scratching like crazy now on

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.810 
prone to scratching like crazy now on
the<00:01:37.439> HTC<00:01:37.860> m8<00:01:38.159> which<00:01:38.340> I'm<00:01:38.460> showing<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> guys

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the HTC m8 which I'm showing you guys

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
the HTC m8 which I'm showing you guys
right<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> metal<00:01:39.659> phone<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.619> little

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
right now the metal phone it's a little

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
right now the metal phone it's a little
bit<00:01:40.920> difficult<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:41.640> own<00:01:41.820> eyes<00:01:42.000> it's

bit difficult to see if my own eyes it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
bit difficult to see if my own eyes it's
a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.479> easier<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.229> these<00:01:43.470> little

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
a lot easier to see all these little

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
a lot easier to see all these little
scratches<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.549> fine<00:01:44.850> scratches<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.540> and

scratches these fine scratches here and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.560 
scratches these fine scratches here and
there<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:46.770> plastic<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.939> self-healing

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
there now plastic it can be self-healing

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
there now plastic it can be self-healing
sometimes<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> scratch<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.860> little<00:01:50.040> bit

good<00:02:31.299> for<00:02:31.510> people<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.780> travel<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> lot<00:02:32.379> they

have to carry a spare battery or let's
say<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.560> get<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.799> faulty<00:02:36.189> battery<00:02:36.519> need<00:02:36.730> to

say you get a faulty battery need to

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.729 
say you get a faulty battery need to
repair<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.359> well<00:02:37.510> instead<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.319> going<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> a

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
repair it well instead of going to a

maybe you can just buy one on your own
and<00:02:42.669> just<00:02:42.849> switch<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.120> yourself<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.019> let's

and just switch it yourself and let's

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.659 
and just switch it yourself and let's
not<00:02:44.290> forget<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.560> metal<00:02:44.919> phones<00:02:45.099> tend<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.549> be

it's not as good to say a rubber foam
which<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.030> very<00:02:52.629> rare<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.230> they<00:02:53.409> do<00:02:53.470> exist<00:02:53.680> the
