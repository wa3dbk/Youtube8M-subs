what data type so is it going to be an

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.660 
what data type so is it going to be an
integer<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.710> extreme<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.550> we

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
integer is it can be extreme are we

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.450 
integer is it can be extreme are we
looking<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.210> off<00:00:45.539> etc<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
looking for on off etc all right so in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
looking for on off etc all right so in
this<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.910> quick<00:00:48.120> example<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.989> making<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this very quick example in making a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
this very quick example in making a
window<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.340> focus<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.090> going

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
window what I want to focus on is going

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
window what I want to focus on is going
to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.690> width<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.649> height<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.280> obviously<00:00:53.399> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
to be width and height now obviously we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.360 
to be width and height now obviously we
can<00:00:54.000> specify<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.570> width<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> height

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
can specify a width and a height

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.200 
can specify a width and a height
independently<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> tie<00:00:57.149> these

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
independently but I'm going to tie these

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.209 
independently but I'm going to tie these
two<00:00:57.570> together<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.350> feed<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.800> integer

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
two together then just feed two integer

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
two together then just feed two integer
values<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.030> specify<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> width<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
values to specify what the width and the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.619 
values to specify what the width and the
height<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.149> next<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.539> I'm

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
height is going to be the next thing I'm

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
height is going to be the next thing I'm
going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> look<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
going to look at is going to be the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
going to look at is going to be the
title<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> basically<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.080> going

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
title and basically this is just going

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
title and basically this is just going
to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> title<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.100> found<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to be the title that will be found in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
to be the title that will be found in
the<00:01:08.580> title<00:01:08.970> bar<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> window<00:01:10.020> itself<00:01:10.350> then

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the title bar of the window itself then

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380 
the title bar of the window itself then
we're<00:01:11.189> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> spend<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.850> second<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
talk about visible so let's go ahead and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
talk about visible so let's go ahead and
create<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> window<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.380> we're<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> start

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
create a window so we're going to start

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.030 
create a window so we're going to start
out<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.640> elf<00:01:17.850> command<00:01:18.240> window<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> then

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
out with the elf command window and then

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.270 
out with the elf command window and then
I'm<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.909> short<00:01:21.540> name<00:01:21.810> dash<00:01:22.590> WH

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
I'm going to use the short name dash WH

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.570 
I'm going to use the short name dash WH
for<00:01:23.610> width<00:01:23.820> height<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.030> let's<00:01:24.990> say<00:01:25.580> 300

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
for width height and let's say 300

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.319 
for width height and let's say 300
pixels<00:01:26.939> wide<00:01:27.180> by<00:01:28.310> 500<00:01:29.310> pixels<00:01:29.610> high<00:01:29.850> sounds

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
pixels wide by 500 pixels high sounds

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
pixels wide by 500 pixels high sounds
good<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.290> let's<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.619> ahead<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> give<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
good now let's go ahead and give this a

going to be using short names for all of
my<00:01:36.689> flags<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:37.950> completely<00:01:38.340> new<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
my flags but if you're completely new to

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.069 
my flags but if you're completely new to
starting<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.240> mil<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> highly<00:01:39.930> recommend

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
starting with mil I highly recommend

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
starting with mil I highly recommend
using<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> long<00:01:41.340> names<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.090> will

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
using the long names because it will

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
using the long names because it will
make<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.960> lot<00:01:43.079> easier<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.829> go<00:01:44.070> back

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
make it a lot easier for you to go back

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
make it a lot easier for you to go back
through<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:45.030> code<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> recognize

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
through look at your code and recognize

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.929 
through look at your code and recognize
what<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.220> were<00:01:47.430> trying<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> do

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
what it was that you were trying to do

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
what it was that you were trying to do
in<00:01:48.149> case<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.420> may<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.720> forgotten<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.740> right

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
in case you may have forgotten all right

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.139 
in case you may have forgotten all right

so the title title bar is going to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.889 
so the title title bar is going to
contain<00:01:51.360> something<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.380> cool<00:01:53.009> window<00:01:53.970> my

happen to be working with a video card
that's<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.860> little<00:03:13.070> bit<00:03:13.160> slower<00:03:13.520> for<00:03:13.880> whatever

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that's a little bit slower for whatever

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.530 
that's a little bit slower for whatever
reason<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.930> won't<00:03:15.080> see<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.710> UI<00:03:16.070> draw<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.940> so

let's go ahead and demonstrate how we

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.000 
let's go ahead and demonstrate how we
can<00:03:19.670> use<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.240> show<00:03:20.660> window<00:03:21.020> command<00:03:21.620> along

can use the show window command along
with<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.820> window<00:03:23.150> elf<00:03:23.390> command<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.290> let's<00:03:24.470> go

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
with the window elf command so let's go

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.620 
with the window elf command so let's go
ahead<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.860> remove<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.610> visible<00:03:26.060> flag<00:03:26.360> out

ahead and remove this visible flag out

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.430 
ahead and remove this visible flag out
like<00:03:27.110> such<00:03:27.410> now<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.490> I<00:03:28.670> execute<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.510> line<00:03:29.570> so

like such now if I execute this line so

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.570 
like such now if I execute this line so
let's<00:03:30.590> go<00:03:30.710> and<00:03:30.860> highlight<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.490> we

pain control enter the window is indeed
create<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.650> see<00:03:36.830> the<00:03:36.980> result<00:03:37.400> fed<00:03:37.670> back

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
create it we can see the result fed back

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.640 
create it we can see the result fed back
up<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.330> us<00:03:38.450> here<00:03:38.690> in<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.870> history<00:03:39.200> pain<00:03:39.410> is

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
up to us here in the history pain is

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.980 
up to us here in the history pain is
result<00:03:40.100> my<00:03:40.580> window<00:03:40.970> meaning<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.600> object

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
result my window meaning that the object

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.500 
result my window meaning that the object
now<00:03:42.140> exists<00:03:42.680> but<00:03:43.310> we<00:03:43.490> don't<00:03:43.730> see<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.360> object

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
now exists but we don't see the object

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.110 
now exists but we don't see the object
so<00:03:45.290> how<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.590> we<00:03:45.860> make<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.250> object<00:03:47.000> visible

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
so how can we make this object visible

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.680 
so how can we make this object visible
now<00:03:47.990> we<00:03:48.200> can<00:03:48.320> turn<00:03:48.530> around<00:03:48.650> after<00:03:49.070> we<00:03:49.910> create

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
now we can turn around after we create

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.540 
now we can turn around after we create
all<00:03:50.840> of<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.140> different<00:03:51.470> buttons<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.370> sliders
