started well you can always start with

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.960 
started well you can always start with
the<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.849> 10k<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.900> goes<00:03:58.079> down<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.970> Grand

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
the the 10k one it goes down the Grand

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.869 
the the 10k one it goes down the Grand
River<00:04:00.410> towards<00:04:01.410> Paris<00:04:01.829> just<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.370> flat<00:04:02.609> stretch

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
River towards Paris just a flat stretch

but<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.810> 25k<00:04:04.470> i<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.340> best<00:04:05.549> one

but the 25k i think is the the best one

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.140 
but the 25k i think is the the best one
is<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.299> heads<00:04:06.810> out<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.379> town<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.190> along<00:04:08.819> to

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150
