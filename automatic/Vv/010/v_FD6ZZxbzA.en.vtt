00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:11.099
 It's February 26, 2014 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.639
 we are here again on the site 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.779
 paradise in June just in the formed 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.090
 even making a new Maya making a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:26.869
 operation called 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.029
 recommended for our dear friend 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:37.190
 walder tanabi 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.190
 this operation has the objective of 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:49.129
 radically halt the growth of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:53.780
 of the branches of the branches making a pruning 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 right at the tip of the branch 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:04.619
 so it for growth and plant 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.330
 has more energy to fill the fruits 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.560
 instead of making the branches grow 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.470
 so you see the beauty that is here 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.030
 very fast in the operation it uses a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.140
 small fork she brings the branch in the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.930
 in an easy position with what with 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.600
 another hand she can get the point 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.960
 now we'll see on the other side here the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.540
 He is already taller and he does not use the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.290
 twig he uses both hands 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.390
 He does not use a fork. I mean he 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.790
 also does this very quickly and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.360
 while we are talking here 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.070
 people see that another 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.649
 tree in atemÃ³ia tree on lot c 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 we are there with the fruits in 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.390
 development let's get closer 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.800
 here for you to see the fruits 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.680
 still have a lot to grow 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.269
 probably still about three months 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.750
 these here and before going to the market 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.280
 and to the table full of housewives of the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.870
 Brazil, right? 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.889
 here you can see an overview of 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.269
 orchard where we see everything very well 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.329
 caution 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.709
 Thanks to this, it 's a very 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:45.109
 of this dynamic double that is the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.180
 joao batista generoso and adileuza fÃ©lix 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:52.370
 Very well, let's put this on YouTube. 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.919
 because a lot of producer of even molia 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.780
 Forget about this operation that is going 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.560
 talk that will make the fruit grow 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.700
 enough 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.700
 that's it
