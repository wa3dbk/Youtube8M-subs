00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
basically from what I noticed when I'm

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
basically from what I noticed when I'm
when<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.010> using<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> gun<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:09.090> kill<00:01:09.299> one

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
when I was using this gun gonna kill one

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.289 
when I was using this gun gonna kill one
guy<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.490> reload<00:01:11.760> after<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
guy and then you can reload after that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.320 
guy and then you can reload after that
cuz<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:13.409> whole<00:01:13.619> clips<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> done

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.510 

but<00:01:17.900> maybe<00:01:18.050> it's<00:01:18.440> just<00:01:18.500> me<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.010> know<00:01:19.040> maybe<00:01:19.460> I

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
but maybe it's just me you know maybe I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.760 
but maybe it's just me you know maybe I
just<00:01:19.730> slept<00:01:19.910> using<00:01:20.240> this<00:01:20.330> gun<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:24.380> don't

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
just slept using this gun and I don't

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.770 
just slept using this gun and I don't
think<00:01:24.980> it's<00:01:25.100> overpowered<00:01:25.690> not<00:01:26.690> at<00:01:26.810> all<00:01:26.960> I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
think it's overpowered not at all I

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.330 
think it's overpowered not at all I
guess<00:01:29.780> people<00:01:30.050> think<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.500> cuz<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:30.980> wasn't

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
guess people think it is cuz it wasn't

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.900 
guess people think it is cuz it wasn't
call<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.580> duty<00:01:34.390> but<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:37.130> not<00:01:37.310> overpowered<00:01:37.730> my

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
call of duty but it's not overpowered my

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.910 
call of duty but it's not overpowered my
