then you know you can like that do not
around<00:02:11.980> itself<00:02:12.460> I<00:02:12.730> kind<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:12.970> think<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.360> that

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
around itself I kind of think so that

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
around itself I kind of think so that
you<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.930> curled<00:02:14.320> at<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> end<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.160> then

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
you can have curled at the end and then

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.000 
you can have curled at the end and then
you<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:16.090> know<00:02:16.209> um<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:17.200> both<00:02:17.500> hands<00:02:17.800> secure

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
you you know um use both hands secure

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.640 
you you know um use both hands secure
and<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:18.550> come<00:02:19.270> back<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> ends

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
and then come back you not at the ends

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.320 
and then come back you not at the ends
and<00:02:20.830> then<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.370> know<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.760> know<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.030> rest<00:02:22.120> you
