00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.230 
OST so I mean that reason alone is not
enough<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:14.920> me<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.190> into<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.670> again<00:02:15.910> but

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
enough for me to get into it again but

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.990 
enough for me to get into it again but
the<00:02:16.870> sound<00:02:17.140> was<00:02:17.260> interesting<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.130> mean<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the sound was interesting I mean the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.270 
the sound was interesting I mean the
character<00:02:19.450> designs<00:02:19.810> kind<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.770> remind<00:02:21.100> me<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
character designs kind of remind me of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.480 
character designs kind of remind me of
one<00:02:21.580> piece<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:22.000> bit<00:02:22.210> but<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.380> mean<00:02:23.770> besides<00:02:24.010> that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
one piece of bit but I mean besides that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.430 
one piece of bit but I mean besides that
it<00:02:24.850> does<00:02:25.480> look<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.870> something<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.290> I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it does look like something that I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.470 
it does look like something that I
probably<00:02:26.740> could<00:02:27.130> get<00:02:27.400> back<00:02:27.580> into<00:02:27.790> but<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.270> don't

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480
