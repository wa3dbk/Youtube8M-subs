00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 in the championship a bitter defeat no 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.330
 walter with our milano morning 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.190
 please add up with sea view was one 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.150
 difficult game maybe even fin 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.790
 from the beginning 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.190
 dear learn from a point of view 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.170
 today he feels under miss abruzzo point 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 as it matured there were then 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 when things are not going well 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 first of all it competes if not there 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 they are the conditions of another 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.960
 man so here we had relocated the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.719
 game we were a little foolish today and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.030
 so the bad day comes I have 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.250
 already said reds colleagues one 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.550
 empowered to have it play 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.829
 too many people who have been players of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.710
 four sensitive steps I thought that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.920
 dinner automatic with possibly the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 players are going to lose the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 race 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.610
 Today we go we looked like the many 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.950
 individual duels lost this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.420
 means the square and this is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.710
 what he said earlier to do 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 football at these levels 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 all the components are needed 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.299
 physical and mental adrenaline and to hide 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.479
 name we did not arrive on the parma we were 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 awkwardly doll-like we looked 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.670
 be used if then level maybe one 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 more experienced brush IGT not educated the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.909
 hands ten stopped does not take four 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.360
 goal at least ability to speak 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.579
 do something in the strippers on 4 1 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.950
 the authors are crazy that ends 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.770
 we have but after months but it was too much 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.570
 the vastness of it is compromised 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 found a harakiri but none at all 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.470
 then that will be a como with the expulsion 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.049
 to give the definitive turning point because 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.540
 but you have already suffered from the beginning 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.729
 talked about this maybe missed 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.500
 turnover turn away very criticized a 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.740
 ganau free on the new real why 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 Valeri turnover seen too because 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.390
 rightly out because where a little while ago 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.610
 so much because that case marchetti does not 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 certainly 9 saw a colleague of mine yesterday 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.010
 good are stations with a reality of the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.739
 partner 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.120
 said many considerations this time 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.840
 of my considerations on states 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:35.370
 wrong 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:36.840
 these things the inter is something that you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.930
 allow this name because then 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.489
 end we invent a talent of the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.500
 girl day and maybe because in short 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.599
 how to say while others say but maybe 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.819
 it's better this no no I said it before 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.160
 I at first have a great shot 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.049
 but today some foreign new york 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.640
 sample condition remind us of 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.380
 look at the team automatisms 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.849
 three days ago they did very well 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.060
 talking to them 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.620
 not happy to train there I searched 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 of basins could still be 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.819
 when you talk to players of every type 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 the only thing the guys with friends 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.110
 we know well maybe all minors 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.170
 are fine I am careful to play 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.970
 and I underestimated Michigan anyway 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.319
 we will launch players if they prepare 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.829
 someone or suddenly changes 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.900
 does and Sunday morning in the area 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.440
 important row however is team that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.959
 they consider the menu to be silos they get points 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.850
 do not eat constant wind or china between them 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.739
 to give a little in my house intervals 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.389
 active mother from rita is a championship 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.700
 I think it is destined for this long 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.709
 duel between juve and roma no possible 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.310
 placement for you or others 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.109
 after three days ago 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.600
 meanwhile a count of the names from today 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.090
 we have today when then things on 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.549
 Cobain and I also intend to share the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.420
 redemption nendo no to joke mine 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.609
 first the game 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.090
 too bad to be less then 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.980
 in front of Gianni filed we do not have 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.660
 never noticed them clearly that those two 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.420
 teams lines to prove to 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.760
 four corners more protected 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.190
 but hide it for sure all the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.959
 others will try not to give up too 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.300
 because the games are so little 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.130
 championship the wolf happens to us all 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.560
 are the direct confrontations there are stacks 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.739
 beatable in my opinion too early to 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:26.060
 balance sheets dealt with but for the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.060
 coffin is very nice manzillo dated
