one<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.400> there<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:17.110> doesn't<00:02:17.410> fit<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.220> I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
one in there but it doesn't fit and I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.080 
one in there but it doesn't fit and I
didn't<00:02:18.850> want<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.030> chop<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:20.230> anyways

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
didn't want to chop it up but anyways

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.660 
didn't want to chop it up but anyways
the<00:02:22.090> p90<00:02:22.660> sounds<00:02:23.230> excellent<00:02:23.800> acoustically

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the p90 sounds excellent acoustically

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.590 
the p90 sounds excellent acoustically
electrically<00:02:25.600> acoustically<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.760> first

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
electrically acoustically and the first

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.960 
electrically acoustically and the first
vector3<00:02:28.930> sounded<00:02:29.860> wonderful

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
vector3 sounded wonderful

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.660 
vector3 sounded wonderful
as<00:02:31.300> soon<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.600> turned<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.080> distortion

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
as soon as you turned up the distortion

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.850 
as soon as you turned up the distortion
but<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.940> also<00:02:34.090> had<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> lot<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.660> hum<00:02:34.959> too<00:02:35.650> much

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
but it also had a lot of hum too much

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.740 
but it also had a lot of hum too much
hum<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.280> my<00:02:36.430> opinion<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.120> got<00:02:37.330> rid<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.690> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
hum in my opinion so I got rid of it and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.180 
hum in my opinion so I got rid of it and
replaced<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.470> tongue<00:02:38.650> zone<00:02:38.950> which

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
replaced it with the tongue zone which

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.949 
replaced it with the tongue zone which
takes<00:02:39.550> away<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.910> hum<00:02:40.060> takes<00:02:40.360> away<00:02:40.600> some<00:02:40.810> of

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
takes away the hum takes away some of

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.949 
takes away the hum takes away some of
its<00:02:41.080> intensity<00:02:41.680> but<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:43.060> definitely<00:02:43.330> gives<00:02:43.750> it

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
its intensity but it definitely gives it

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.590 
its intensity but it definitely gives it
some<00:02:44.110> more<00:02:44.260> tonal<00:02:44.680> qualities<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:46.090> lots

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
some more tonal qualities like a lots

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.490 
some more tonal qualities like a lots
more<00:02:46.750> sustain<00:02:47.260> lots<00:02:47.980> more<00:02:48.160> treble<00:02:48.550> lots<00:02:49.090> more

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
more sustain lots more treble lots more

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
more sustain lots more treble lots more
middle<00:02:50.500> range<00:02:50.880> stuff<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.239> really

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
middle range stuff and it's really

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.170 
middle range stuff and it's really
wonderful<00:02:53.280> together<00:02:54.280> they<00:02:54.790> don't<00:02:54.970> work<00:02:55.150> that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
wonderful together they don't work that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.930 
wonderful together they don't work that
well<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.950> them<00:02:57.070> kind<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.489> eats<00:02:57.670> away<00:02:57.820> at

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
well one of them kind of eats away at

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.940 
well one of them kind of eats away at
the<00:02:58.230> awesomeness<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> other<00:02:59.739> one

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
the awesomeness of the other one

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.740 
the awesomeness of the other one
whenever<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.370> put<00:03:00.519> them<00:03:00.610> together<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:00.940> with

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
whenever you put them together so with

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.810 
whenever you put them together so with
this<00:03:01.900> guitar<00:03:02.220> even<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.430> add<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.640> Brits

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
this guitar even when you add the Brits

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.030 
this guitar even when you add the Brits
vector3<00:03:04.180> when<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.410> standard<00:03:05.860> I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
vector3 when you get it standard I

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.509 
vector3 when you get it standard I
definitely<00:03:06.850> recommend<00:03:07.709> using<00:03:08.709> rather<00:03:09.100> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
definitely recommend using rather the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.610 
definitely recommend using rather the
fully<00:03:09.760> up<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.420> fully<00:03:10.630> down<00:03:10.810> position<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
fully up the fully down position on the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.150 
fully up the fully down position on the
toggle<00:03:11.800> switch<00:03:12.390> because<00:03:13.769> it'll<00:03:14.769> get<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.070> the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
toggle switch because it'll get you the

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.500 
toggle switch because it'll get you the
best<00:03:15.370> sound<00:03:15.579> out<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.820> both<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:16.150> pickups

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
best sound out of both your pickups

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.569 
best sound out of both your pickups
without<00:03:16.810> taking<00:03:17.260> away<00:03:17.350> from<00:03:17.530> them<00:03:17.950> which<00:03:18.459> is

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
without taking away from them which is

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.420 
without taking away from them which is
what<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> found<00:03:19.049> other<00:03:20.049> than<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:21.100> guitar

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
what I found other than that the guitar

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.500 
what I found other than that the guitar
is<00:03:21.760> cheaper<00:03:22.690> than<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.709> Les<00:03:23.890> Paul<00:03:23.920> by<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> third<00:03:25.060> or

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
is cheaper than a Les Paul by a third or

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.990 
is cheaper than a Les Paul by a third or
two<00:03:25.959> thirds<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.709> 1/3<00:03:26.980> as<00:03:27.160> extent<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.760> it

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
two thirds so it's 1/3 as extent of it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.050 
two thirds so it's 1/3 as extent of it
as<00:03:28.180> expensive<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:28.840> one<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:30.700> got

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
as expensive this one and it's got

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.490 
as expensive this one and it's got
pretty<00:03:31.480> much<00:03:31.630> all<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.930> options<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.320> need
