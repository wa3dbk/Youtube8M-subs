00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.690
 good to do this shirt first 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hi, do n't 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.490
 the battery has just finished but then it is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 when I'm counting the mold on it 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.650
 this one here but when you print in eu 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.650
 I'll put the link 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.910
 but when you print to try not 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.810
 spend all the ink on the computer as 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.489
 I did, my mom got a little dizzy. 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.690
 but then, despite tissue paint, the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 what you want 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 in case a t-shirt a light blue 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 I'll try to leave it after it's or 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.070
 that I'm going to use a base of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 wood or anything to support the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.640
 light snack to think of my 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.810
 this one then I go back to cut the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.390
 move in here while the cut I go 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.290
 put the camera to charge because I 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 I forgot to pay before so that's it 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.000
 then it is I cut the mold of time favor 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 of your county 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.320
 It's time, please do not do not destroy a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 today how I did 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.910
 It would be half my trolley no longer that the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.060
 piece here then you regard it all and 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:48.360
 then fasten with a tape learned 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:52.130
 here in the middle also not to let go and there 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.300
 He's going to paint, I'm going to leave his mother-in-law. 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:06.979
 that I can not was the camera will fall 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:06.979
 But you already start with such 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:26.550
 and be careful not to paint out because I 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.550
 I'm good of those 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.660
 and always holding there not to not 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.519
 drop 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.480
 I'll stop recording a little and when 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.480
 is ending 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.010
 I come back 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.489
 So 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:07.079
 so I did type a outline is not 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:12.170
 I did not count everything in and now I'm going to take it 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:17.549
 Ill get sick of it 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:21.290
 but then 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.290
 I heard you gave 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:29.400
 Good people stayed like this and now I'm going to paint 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.640
 it 's year too 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.480
 I did not think it was that much. 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:43.380
 bad but I'm surprised that it even stayed 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:51.440
 cool and still missing the polka dot issue 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:56.130
 I think only then is a little thing that 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:03.230
 I took too but she just did not think so. 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.230
 it got bad, it's cool and do it too
