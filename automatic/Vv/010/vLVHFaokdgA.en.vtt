first<00:00:27.810> let's<00:00:28.260> take<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.470> look<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> tools

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
first let's take a look at the tools

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
first let's take a look at the tools
you'll<00:00:29.580> need<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> job<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.869> first<00:00:31.080> you're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you'll need for the job so first you're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.540 
you'll need for the job so first you're
going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> flat<00:00:32.099> head<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.340> a

that's<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> get<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:34.860> your<00:00:34.980> case<00:00:35.219> you're

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that's just to get into your case you're

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
that's just to get into your case you're
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.329> new<00:00:36.450> CPU<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
going to want your new CPU this is a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.440 
going to want your new CPU this is a
retail<00:00:37.829> box<00:00:38.100> version<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> includes<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.300> heat

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

retail box version so it includes a heat
sink<00:00:39.719> fan<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.829> finally<00:00:41.250> you're<00:00:41.340> going

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
sink fan and then finally you're going

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.860 
sink fan and then finally you're going
to<00:00:41.520> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> worry<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.390> existing

the heatsink fan should pop right off
just<00:01:59.729> give<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.030> wiggle<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.680> your

thermal paste is loosened up it should
lift<00:02:03.689> off

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.980

unplug the power for the the fan and
you're<00:02:10.680> all<00:02:10.890> set<00:02:11.300> now<00:02:12.300> step<00:02:12.600> three<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you're all set now step three is to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560 
you're all set now step three is to
clean<00:02:13.710> your<00:02:13.860> thermal<00:02:14.280> paste<00:02:14.520> now<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.540> a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
clean your thermal paste now we have a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.050 
clean your thermal paste now we have a
brand<00:02:16.020> new<00:02:16.170> CPU<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.220> brand<00:02:17.460> new<00:02:17.580> heat<00:02:17.760> sink

brand new CPU and a brand new heat sink

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.490 
brand new CPU and a brand new heat sink
fan<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.630> don't<00:02:18.780> necessarily<00:02:18.870> need<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
fan so we don't necessarily need to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.960 
fan so we don't necessarily need to
clean<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.950> order<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.370> these<00:02:20.490> installed

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
that old thermal material removed so you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
that old thermal material removed so you
can<00:02:32.850> reuse<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.270> parts<00:02:39.050> now<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.170> we<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
can reuse the parts now that we got the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.900 
can reuse the parts now that we got the

just<00:04:21.449> like<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.840> old<00:04:22.019> one<00:04:22.289> removed<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.949> you

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
just like the old one removed so you

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.999 
just like the old one removed so you
hook<00:04:23.220> one<00:04:23.490> bracket<00:04:23.789> over<00:04:24.389> there<00:04:24.889> once<00:04:25.889> you

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 
hook one bracket over there once you

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.619 
hook one bracket over there once you
have<00:04:26.129> the<00:04:26.220> brackets<00:04:26.610> for<00:04:26.789> both<00:04:26.970> sides<00:04:27.270> clipped

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
have the brackets for both sides clipped

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.879 
have the brackets for both sides clipped
on<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.169> just<00:04:28.470> pop<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.099> into<00:04:29.310> place<00:04:29.639> and<00:04:30.889> it's

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
on you just pop this into place and it's

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.309 
on you just pop this into place and it's
latched<00:04:32.129> on<00:04:32.629> make<00:04:33.629> sure<00:04:33.690> it's<00:04:33.960> nice<00:04:34.110> and

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
latched on make sure it's nice and

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.580 
latched on make sure it's nice and
secure<00:04:34.409> and<00:04:34.830> your<00:04:35.520> new<00:04:35.639> CPU<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.090> installed<00:04:36.590> CPU

header<00:04:38.780> looks<00:04:39.780> back<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:48.169> so<00:04:49.169> now<00:04:49.289> that<00:04:49.349> your

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
CPU is installed you just need to worry

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.089 
CPU is installed you just need to worry
about<00:04:51.360> step<00:04:51.659> six<00:04:51.990> which<00:04:52.229> is<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.590> cure<00:04:52.919> your

about step six which is to cure your
thermal<00:04:53.520> paste<00:04:53.729> so<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.090> can<00:04:54.240> do<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.509> by
