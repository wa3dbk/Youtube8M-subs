00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.820
 welcome to this new show 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.789

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.740
 greet but hey that's okay 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.310
 trout fishing web it looks like the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.740
 potato she has resource 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 audrey is nutritionist dietician 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.559
 dietitians or nutritionists it's 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 exist versa that's it and the goal is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 well, it's going to be with us 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.440
 we the idea make sure that we 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 especially since we can eat healthy 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.399
 avoids traps 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 it is true we will try to present 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 recipes that will allow 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.700
 eat more balanced to eat more 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.410
 light but keeping the greedy side 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.879
 so we will try to thwart the pitfalls 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 of some alleyways then audrey that is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 what we have prepared today 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.430
 so today we start with the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.660
 salt pie theme 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.820
 so we will try to present a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.650
 Italian pie today you 'll be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.680
 the greens go to the Italian is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 really nice very well we need 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.590
 onions we need tomatoes 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 because we are going to say a fondue of onions 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 and we're going to make a fondue too 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.210
 tomatoes we will of course have a little bit of 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.119
 basil or for me this Italian 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.670
 we will of course have mozzarella 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.920
 possibly said boufhal if we want 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 well and then cured ham with sorry 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 so the recipe is going to be very tired I 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.659
 specifies that the dough for the moment there 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.579
 is still in the refrigerator is then 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.049
 to start it's going to be easy we have 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.060
 already prepared our onion fondue 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.220
 so that's why I propose to you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 make you cry from the start then 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 for tomatoes we will prepare them in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.340
 washers that will melt the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.280
 onions 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.540
 we will get our washer like 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.810
 tomatoes payet where there are nine fondue 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.790
 onions and we have our tomato puree 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.040
 so we'll be able to switch to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.799
 place our Italian pie then 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.479
 for that we will already put the dough 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.520
 salty pie usually we did it 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 with puff pastry sometimes seen 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.129
 some do it with a broken dough 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 me for example here are parties seem 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.910
 no sand and it's a lot rarer 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.220
 because it's earlier 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.990
 desserts so we rather have a dough 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.400
 puff or a broken dough on 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.720
 problem is that puff pastry it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.570
 do not break it's ingredients 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 who are sheets to make a pie 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 salty that will be light is that we will 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.300
 finally take a pizza dough 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.210
 even if we do not do it ourselves 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.550
 is about 5 grams of material 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.330
 fat for 100 g 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.090
 it's crazy it's completely 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.970
 hallucinating says now that's it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.500
 why are we going to apply it and so there 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.790
 on our pizza dough which is sum 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.290
 very slight 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.810
 is not it we will be able to put 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.030
 our ingredients the onion fondue and 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.500
 so it's a food that is very little 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.420
 caloric so limit the onions 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 no, but the quantity we want is 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.690
 not a problem for the aspect 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.370
 nutritional 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.170
 so that's good onion these good 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.800
 onion then there is the same in kind 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.200
 and tomatoes 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.540
 similarly it is a fruit 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.100
 botanically may so it's a food 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.190
 very low in calories 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.750
 you can consume at will then a little 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.640
 a little salt 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.660
 that's done and then we'll put a 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.630
 little basil then we will keep 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.459
 some basil leaves for the go 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.510
 for the final touch for decoration by 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.920
 against if we can put a little bit 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.660
 hungry if you can chisel a little bit of 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.910
 a little basil it would be great 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.270
 and then on it we will also add 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.420
 olives and of course our mozzarella 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.170
 and our ham mozza is ok 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.990
 not 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.280
 not too much quadrige brings a small 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.690
 little fat and it brings 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.819
 also a little calcium 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.880
 so here we put we chose a 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.530
 ten dozen olive ten dozen 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.510
 losses that would be great for beds 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.819
 our dish and then because in fact the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.230
 black olives are a fatter chouÃ¯a 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.000
 that green olives 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.140
 then we rebalance the rest around 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.510
 but first we have fun on 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.800
 chooses from one already ingredients that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.780
 we like it 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.690
 we will sprinkle a little basil 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.340
 to situate well ok no no it's very 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.090
 well that's fine then we complete 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.290
 then with our mozzarella ah yes there 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.680
 you're just the 4 slices like that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.530
 what 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.720
 and then of course we will add our 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.120
 same gengoux why ham because 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.709
 that raw ham is rich in protein 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.880
 so that will allow us with the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.620
 mozzarella to have our source of 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.240
 proteins and proteins what is it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.380
 serves in the diet I ask 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 questions it's used to do I'm less 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.030
 affable album affermi m ladies it was in 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.889
 done and very structured in your head and 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.669
 structured that's it's nutrition it's 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.130
 a question of structure 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.169
 in fact in the background we have our dough to 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.789
 pizza dough pie our pizza dough 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.470
 it's going to make up what that constituted 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.270
 a starchy food then in a meal 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.390
 balanced we need vegetables at that 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.070
 falls well here we onions and 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.010
 tomatoes that melted vegetables so we fit 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.390
 onion fondue and we have our sauce to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.919
 the tomato then in a balanced dish 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.620
 we need protein 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.630
 so there we have nothing to follow the 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.340
 mozzarella and ham fashion and there 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.930
 ham here we need a product 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.370
 milk also for calcium intake 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.260
 so man mozza she does both the 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.150
 protein and calcium 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.400
 well I'll put that in the oven when 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.710
 same time what temperature then that 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.260
 we're going on 180 so a little bit 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.380
 thermostat 6 and it's about 25 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.510
 30 minutes and would make it is not 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.360
