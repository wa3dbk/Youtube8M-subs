00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800
 Paper rabbit lope 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.733
 sea 

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.733
 Wowâ€¦ 

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:16.833
 so many 

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.733
 Yes 

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.633
 So much 

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.733
 Is quite a lot 

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.533
 I seem to have said it on TV. 

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.566
 what 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.700
 Come to the beach at the end of summer 

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:30.433
 Ok 

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.366
 Beware of a lot of sharks... 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
 That is to say Haitang. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.933
 is it 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.766
 Yes 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.966
 How to do? 

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:45.766
 Ok? 

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.166
 Still use it, there is no way to swim. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.100
 Wait, that's a shark. 

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:52.366
 correct 

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.033
 Sharks eat meat 

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:55.866
 Correct 

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.166
 What about us? 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.166
 Uh 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.033
 Made of paper 

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.733
 Good 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.700
 right? Right? 

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.100
 That's it 

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.200
 So we are fine. 

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.000
 but 

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.666
 What if it doesn't just eat meat? 

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:18.033
 As long as it is something that is moving, it is eaten. 

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.466
 That's it. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.166
 That's right 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.066
 Ok, go home. 

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:41.433
 go home 

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.800
 Go back and rent the "Great White Shark" disc. 

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.800
 Study it well. 

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.033
 Not talking about going to the movies? 

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:50.933
 right 

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.166
 "Great White Shark"... 

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.300
 I don't know if there is any place to put it. 

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:58.166
 No 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.566
 Certainly no 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.533
 that's true 

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:08.533
 To be continued
