 was under reconstruction from the end 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.879
 last year the flames broke out on high 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.250
 35 meters exactly that made it difficult to work 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.930
 firefighters so initially 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.850
 planned to attract a helicopter for 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.850
 extinguishing but in the end there were no aviation 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.150

 inside some 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.620

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.740
 the prior abbot 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.740
 not 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.080
 according to preliminary version 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.520
 law enforcement reason 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.010
 ignition has become careless handling 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.950

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.780
