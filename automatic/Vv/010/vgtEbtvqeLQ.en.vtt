00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
typing on the keyboard however it did

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
take some getting used to I had to do it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.920 
take some getting used to I had to do it
for<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> couple<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.250> tries<00:02:11.660> simply<00:02:12.660> because

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
for a couple of tries simply because

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.600 
for a couple of tries simply because
it's<00:02:13.110> smaller<00:02:13.410> than<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.739> keyboards<00:02:14.190> I'm<00:02:14.310> used

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
it's smaller than the keyboards I'm used

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.170 
it's smaller than the keyboards I'm used
to<00:02:14.730> using<00:02:14.970> like<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.200> computer<00:02:17.180> so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
to using like the one on my computer so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.820 
to using like the one on my computer so
then<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.510> decided<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:19.049> start<00:02:19.260> testing<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
then I decided to start testing the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.320 
then I decided to start testing the
backlight<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.549> keyboard<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> even

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
backlight on the keyboard and even

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.759 
backlight on the keyboard and even
though<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.630> very<00:02:21.780> bright<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.379> enough

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
though it is not very bright is enough

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.650 
though it is not very bright is enough
to<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> realized<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
to see and then I realized that the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.970 
to see and then I realized that the
keyboard<00:02:25.019> also<00:02:25.110> has<00:02:25.349> other<00:02:25.590> cool<00:02:25.950> features

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
such as brightness control and volume

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.589 
such as brightness control and volume
playback<00:02:28.980> another<00:02:29.730> thing<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.060> can<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.420> use
