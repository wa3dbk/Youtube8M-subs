 followed by listing the ingredients for 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.800
 make these cupcakes with mustaches 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.240
 first I go to put the butter 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.460
 inside the container 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.320
 planetary but could go 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.380
 safely to use even one 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.390
 electric mixer put the sugar and 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.980
 I go to work the mixture with the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.190
 whisk until creamy 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.190
 soft 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.140
 as soon as the butter with the sugar will be 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 became a soft cream began to 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.450
 add the eggs one at a time 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.500
 I add the other as soon as both eggs 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.000
 were absorbed and began to 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.240
 put the powders 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.050
 meanwhile the bitter cocoa began to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.050
 add the flour 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.370
 tight coffee 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:05.860
 more flour and I go to alternate with 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.600
 continuous milk until it runs out 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.490
 flour and milk 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.840
 I add a pinch of salt and a pinch 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.340
 of bicarbonate and as the last ingredient 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.120
 baking powder our compound 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.370
 and ready to be put in the cups 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.310
 I took a muffin pan a month 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.490
 I will fill the paper cups inside 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.790
 cupcake with the mixture up to two 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.560
 thirds I usually go to put in a 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.070
 container for liquids when the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.440
 compound is quite soft or 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.630
 you can put it in a porsche or bag 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.480
 you simply enter it with 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.480
 a spoon make it go down 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.220
 with the doses I gave you, they came to me 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.390
 12 marfin I'm going to put them in the oven already 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.370
 static heat at 180 degrees for about 20 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.190
 25 minutes the muffins are ready I leave them 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.470
 cool completely now go to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.750
 make the butter cream I go to 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.230
 put the icing sugar inside 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.460
 of the planetary container 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:33.730
 I add the butter and I go there to insert 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.950
 a vial of vanilla roma go 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.380
 to blend everything with the whisk 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.950
 when I have not gotten nice compound 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.950
 swollen and frothy 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.230
 the butter cream and we'll go 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 just to get a nice cream 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.140
 soft and soft like cream or 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.020
 made of sugar paste 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.760
 I put the link here available if 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.400

 box below the video I'm going to pick it up 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:19.030
 a little piece and I'm going to color it with a 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.030
 black gel dye 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.400
 I went to color peace 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.010
 sugar with black but as you can see it is 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.950
 came a very dark gray 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.560
 let's pretend it's a daddy a 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.770
 a little old with the dye I have 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.900
 I can get a shade of the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.750
 kind do not come the pasta of 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.300
 own black sugar however you can 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.380
 go and color it with a brown color 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:56.260
 wanting now I am going to form a small one 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:05:00.060
 cylinder the length must be from 3 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.060
 at 4 cm 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.040
 I go to make an incision in the center 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:21.460
 after that I go to stretch 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:24.600
 slightly to tighten to close ad 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:31.410
 notes and a little pincers ea 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.410
 turn them upwards in this way 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:46.990
 then vague slightly to flatten 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:48.640
 just slightly fetching 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.820
 this tool or one 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:06:02.050
 toothpick and go to track 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:06:04.470
 small veins on one side and 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.470
 on the other 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.410
 here is the mustache ready 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.200
 I put the butter cream inside 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:24.280
 of a porsche bag with the spout 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:28.850
 starry I try to decorate the muffin 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:36.260
 I'm going to put the butter cream on 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:42.140
 upper part in a circular way so 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:46.400
 simply after that I will go to 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:51.700
 lay over the mustache you can go 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:56.110
 to put with a toothpick inserted 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:04.280
