know mr. Cana came up for the first
cartridge<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.810> did<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.829> utilize<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
cartridge that did not utilize a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.340 
cartridge that did not utilize a
cantilever<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.570> gave<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.740> immediate<00:01:53.009> sound

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
cantilever I gave a more immediate sound

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.710 
cantilever I gave a more immediate sound
less<00:01:55.350> chance<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.829> phase<00:01:56.159> Distortion

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
less chance for phase Distortion

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.580 
less chance for phase Distortion
and<00:01:58.100> just<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.460> live<00:02:00.180> Sam<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.260> of<00:02:01.440> the

and just a more live Sam all of the
setting<00:02:02.370> up<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> cartridges<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.510> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
setting up of cartridges out of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.570 
setting up of cartridges out of
cantilever<00:02:04.110> requires<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.980> little<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.370> more

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
cantilever requires a little bit more

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.620 
cantilever requires a little bit more
more<00:02:05.970> care

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
more care

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.630

you'll<00:04:21.459> flip<00:04:21.669> over<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:22.030> like<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.450> like<00:04:22.720> that

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
you'll flip over I like I like that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.500 
you'll flip over I like I like that
feature<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.669> then<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:24.760> lift<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.090> up<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.390> you

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
feature and then you lift it up and you

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.900 
feature and then you lift it up and you
queue<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.440> over<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:26.860> feels<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.520> bearings

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
queue it over but it feels the bearings

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.990 
queue it over but it feels the bearings
feel<00:04:28.090> nice<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.480> tight<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:30.490> feels<00:04:30.760> as<00:04:30.970> if

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
feel nice and tight and it feels as if

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.350 
feel nice and tight and it feels as if
it's<00:04:31.419> all<00:04:31.960> of<00:04:32.290> one<00:04:32.530> piece<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:33.430> then<00:04:34.150> we'll

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
it's all of one piece and then we'll

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.840 
it's all of one piece and then we'll
just<00:04:34.570> simply<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:36.010> cueing<00:04:36.340> has<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> little

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
just simply a the cueing has a little

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.080 
just simply a the cueing has a little
round<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.800> spherical<00:04:38.800> knob<00:04:39.220> at<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.580> end<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
round a spherical knob at the end of the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.630 
round a spherical knob at the end of the
shaft<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.690> that's<00:04:40.840> it's<00:04:41.680> nice<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.220> nice

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
shaft and that's it's nice and nice

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.820 
shaft and that's it's nice and nice
touch<00:04:42.970> point<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:43.840> then<00:04:43.990> down<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.650> goes

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
touch point to it and then down it goes

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.950 
touch point to it and then down it goes
you'll<00:04:45.730> see<00:04:45.910> it<00:04:46.030> lowers<00:04:46.330> itself<00:04:46.600> into<00:04:46.900> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
you'll see it lowers itself into the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.210 
you'll see it lowers itself into the
groove<00:04:47.290> slowly<00:04:48.250> because<00:04:48.640> it's<00:04:48.790> fluid<00:04:49.000> damned

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
groove slowly because it's fluid damned

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.860 
groove slowly because it's fluid damned
yeah<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.490> the<00:04:51.640> way<00:04:51.760> it's<00:04:51.940> damp<00:04:52.180> even<00:04:52.600> it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
yeah I like the way it's damp even it

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.480 
yeah I like the way it's damp even it
drops<00:04:53.200> right<00:04:53.320> down<00:04:53.440> on<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.919> record<00:04:54.280> very

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
drops right down on the record very

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.540 
drops right down on the record very
slowly<00:04:54.880> yeah<00:04:55.510> with<00:04:55.930> security<00:04:56.530> yeah<00:04:57.220> I'd<00:04:57.370> say

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
slowly yeah with security yeah I'd say

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.630 
slowly yeah with security yeah I'd say
it's<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.850> it's<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.600> bearings<00:04:59.110> are<00:04:59.260> made<00:04:59.470> of

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
it's a it's a the bearings are made of

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.690 
it's a it's a the bearings are made of
the<00:05:00.640> most<00:05:00.850> zero<00:05:01.180> clearance<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.430> in<00:05:03.430> those

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
the most zero clearance and in those

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.850 
the most zero clearance and in those
bearings<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.510> are<00:05:05.200> actually<00:05:05.560> made<00:05:05.740> of

bearings that are actually made of
stainless<00:05:06.100> steel<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:07.360> you<00:05:08.169> know<00:05:08.740> the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.490 
arms that were bearings only on one side
of<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.950> shaft<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.940> now<00:05:22.180> they're<00:05:22.870> bearings<00:05:23.380> on

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
of the shaft and now they're bearings on

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.969 
of the shaft and now they're bearings on
both<00:05:23.740> sides<00:05:24.070> of<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> shaft<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.940> that

both sides of the shaft and that

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.310 
both sides of the shaft and that
increases<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.520> know<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.820> overall

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
increases the you know the overall

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.370 
increases the you know the overall
stability<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.950> tonearm<00:05:30.190> mm-hmm<00:05:31.380> now

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
stability of the tonearm mm-hmm now

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.020 
stability of the tonearm mm-hmm now
looking<00:05:32.770> at<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.010> tonearm<00:05:33.400> you'll<00:05:33.700> see<00:05:33.880> that

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
looking at the tonearm you'll see that

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.820 
looking at the tonearm you'll see that
the<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:35.620> counterweight<00:05:36.190> is<00:05:36.430> got<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.840> semi<00:05:37.840> or<00:05:38.800> a

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
the the counterweight is got a semi or a

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.040 
the the counterweight is got a semi or a
half<00:05:39.400> spherical<00:05:40.060> shape<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.510> it<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.750> what<00:05:40.900> was

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
half spherical shape to it of what was

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.050 
half spherical shape to it of what was
that<00:05:41.500> part<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:42.010> the<00:05:42.100> design<00:05:42.430> parameter<00:05:42.940> it

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
that part of the design parameter it

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.750 
that part of the design parameter it
surely<00:05:43.330> looks<00:05:43.360> beautiful<00:05:44.080> it's<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.979> yeah<00:05:45.310> yep

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
surely looks beautiful it's a yeah yep

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.940 
surely looks beautiful it's a yeah yep
yeah<00:05:46.120> you'll<00:05:46.390> see<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.840> there<00:05:47.410> really<00:05:47.440> are<00:05:47.800> no

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
yeah you'll see that there really are no

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.219 
yeah you'll see that there really are no
hard<00:05:48.280> edges<00:05:48.490> on<00:05:48.850> that<00:05:48.880> arm<00:05:49.360> mm-hmm<00:05:50.110> and

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
hard edges on that arm mm-hmm and

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.400 
hard edges on that arm mm-hmm and
everything<00:05:51.220> is<00:05:51.400> is<00:05:51.610> rounded<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.140> idea

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
everything is is rounded and the idea

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.370 
everything is is rounded and the idea
behind<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.890> is<00:05:54.010> is<00:05:54.490> to<00:05:55.440> it<00:05:56.440> is<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:56.860> lessen<00:05:57.070> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
behind that is is to it is to lessen the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.159 
behind that is is to it is to lessen the
chances<00:05:59.380> for<00:05:59.440> for<00:05:59.919> resonances<00:06:00.490> okay<00:06:01.450> in<00:06:01.900> that

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
chances for for resonances okay in that

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.100 
chances for for resonances okay in that
tone<00:06:02.470> arm<00:06:02.710> so<00:06:02.979> so<00:06:03.310> being<00:06:03.640> rounded<00:06:04.150> I<00:06:04.660> think

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
tone arm so so being rounded I think

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.310 
tone arm so so being rounded I think
this<00:06:05.260> just<00:06:05.710> provides<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:06.250> quieter<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.930> less

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
this just provides a quieter and less

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.070 
this just provides a quieter and less
less<00:06:08.650> of<00:06:08.830> a<00:06:08.890> chance<00:06:09.160> to<00:06:09.340> hear<00:06:09.729> any<00:06:10.660> unwanted

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
less of a chance to hear any unwanted

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.879 
less of a chance to hear any unwanted
resonances<00:06:11.890> in<00:06:12.100> the<00:06:12.520> arm<00:06:12.669> itself

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889 
resonances in the arm itself

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.040 
resonances in the arm itself
now<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.430> arm<00:06:14.729> comes<00:06:15.030> in<00:06:15.210> two<00:06:15.419> lengths<00:06:15.870> we<00:06:16.020> have

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
now the arm comes in two lengths we have

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.600
