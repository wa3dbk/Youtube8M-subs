piece that I got damaged the most he's a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.100 
piece that I got damaged the most he's a
little<00:01:28.820> bit<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.030> abrasions<00:01:29.570> need<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.780> repaint

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
little bit of abrasions need to repaint

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.770 
little bit of abrasions need to repaint
it<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.580> foot<00:01:32.240> peg<00:01:32.450> got<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.690> little

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it really and the foot peg got a little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.600 
it really and the foot peg got a little
squished<00:01:33.259> by<00:01:33.470> probably<00:01:33.770> replacing<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.400> foot

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
squished by probably replacing that foot

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.719 
squished by probably replacing that foot
peg<00:01:34.850> here<00:01:35.600> directly<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.890> bars<00:01:37.100> actually<00:01:37.369> got

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
peg here directly the bars actually got

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.010 
peg here directly the bars actually got
twisted<00:01:38.180> just<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.770> little<00:01:39.800> bit<00:01:41.020> hardly

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
twisted just it just a little bit hardly

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.620 
twisted just it just a little bit hardly
really<00:01:42.229> even<00:01:42.440> noticeable<00:01:42.800> but<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.330> good<00:01:44.330> reason

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
really even noticeable but a good reason

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
really even noticeable but a good reason
to<00:01:44.690> go<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.960> replace<00:01:45.140> them<00:01:45.350> just<00:01:45.590> because<00:01:45.740> get

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
to go and replace them just because get

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.139 
to go and replace them just because get
something<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:46.940> little<00:01:47.030> better<00:01:49.149> definitely

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
something a little better definitely

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.300 
something a little better definitely
it's<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.299> time<00:01:50.479> for<00:01:50.509> some<00:01:50.810> new<00:01:50.840> tires<00:01:51.220> which<00:01:52.220> I

cracked one of the frame sliders
actually<00:02:07.670> during<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.880> tree<00:02:08.090> crossing<00:02:08.539> that

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
actually during a tree crossing that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.910 
actually during a tree crossing that
same<00:02:08.869> trip<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> dragon<00:02:09.649> we<00:02:09.800> actually

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920

same trip to the dragon we actually
started<00:02:10.519> lesson<00:02:10.700> on<00:02:10.789> some<00:02:11.560> national<00:02:12.560> forest

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
started lesson on some national forest

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.979 
started lesson on some national forest
roads<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.150> when<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:14.630> went<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.930> over

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
roads and and when we went up and over

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.770 
roads and and when we went up and over
the<00:02:15.200> tree<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.500> clip<00:02:15.739> clip<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:17.330> broke

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780

the tree we clip clip it and it broke
the<00:02:17.930> slider<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.410> got<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> replace<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.980> one

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
the slider so I got to replace that one

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.220 
the slider so I got to replace that one
too<00:02:22.239> but<00:02:23.239> this<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> should<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.959> cool<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.200> see

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
too but this is it should be cool to see

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.690 
too but this is it should be cool to see
the<00:02:24.380> transformation<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.340> start<00:02:25.549> adding

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
the transformation as we start adding

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.799 
the transformation as we start adding
parts<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.360> look<00:02:27.200> forward<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.620> it
