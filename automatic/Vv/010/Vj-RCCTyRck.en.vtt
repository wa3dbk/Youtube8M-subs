his heart rabbids on human liver and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.520 
his heart rabbids on human liver and
like

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
like

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.020 
like
I was<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:13.860> finding<00:02:14.130> weird<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.790> he

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
I was just finding weird that like he

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.640 
I was just finding weird that like he
would<00:02:15.180> still<00:02:15.510> be<00:02:15.720> able<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.959> stand<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.470> I

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
would still be able to stand because I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.910 
would still be able to stand because I
thought<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:17.630> would<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.990> know<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.500> it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
thought you would you know be like it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.760 
thought you would you know be like it
I'm<00:02:20.069> dead<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.390> then<00:02:21.540> again<00:02:21.569> he's<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.020> yokai<00:02:22.440> so

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
I'm dead but then again he's a yokai so

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.220 
I'm dead but then again he's a yokai so
I<00:02:23.100> guess<00:02:23.700> he<00:02:23.850> doesn't<00:02:24.150> need<00:02:24.300> human<00:02:24.750> liver<00:02:24.930> to

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
I guess he doesn't need human liver to

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.410 
I guess he doesn't need human liver to
live<00:02:25.440> but<00:02:25.740> yeah<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.880> found<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.150> kind<00:02:27.360> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
liver getting tooken out which to meet

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.150 
liver getting tooken out which to meet
to<00:02:42.090> me<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.930> seemed<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.830> didn't

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
to me like it seemed like it just didn't

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.930 
to me like it seemed like it just didn't
I<00:02:44.390> guess<00:02:45.390> faze<00:02:45.840> them<00:02:46.050> at<00:02:46.200> all<00:02:46.350> because

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I guess faze them at all because

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.310 
I guess faze them at all because
apparently<00:02:47.940> yokai<00:02:48.480> don't<00:02:48.690> need<00:02:48.870> their<00:02:49.019> liver

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
apparently yokai don't need their liver

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.100 
apparently yokai don't need their liver
so<00:02:50.150> um<00:02:51.650> yeah<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.610> guess<00:02:53.820> that's<00:02:54.540> pretty

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
so um yeah and I guess that's pretty

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.979 
so um yeah and I guess that's pretty
much<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.620> um<00:02:56.450> wondering<00:02:57.450> what's<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.900> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
