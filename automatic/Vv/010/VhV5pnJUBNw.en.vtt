00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
in batch two should so right there she

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
in batch two should so right there she
confirmed<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.180> there<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.360> not<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.780> be

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
confirmed that there is not going to be

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.540 
confirmed that there is not going to be
two<00:03:04.050> separate<00:03:04.380> challenges<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.190> only<00:03:05.340> going

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
two separate challenges it's only going

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.280 
two separate challenges it's only going
to<00:03:05.610> be<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.300> will<00:03:06.390> remain<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.810> same<00:03:07.020> or

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
to be one and it will remain the same or

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.690 
to be one and it will remain the same or
racks<00:03:07.680> or<00:03:07.800> is<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.100> there<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
racks or is in there and it is a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.090 
racks or is in there and it is a
completion<00:03:09.239> escape<00:03:09.510> requirement<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.860> this

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
completion escape requirement so this

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250 
completion escape requirement so this
brings<00:03:11.250> me<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.730> my<00:03:12.030> opinion<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.570> this<00:03:12.690> now

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
brings me to my opinion of this now

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.630 
brings me to my opinion of this now
first<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.709> all<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.830> believe<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.489> there<00:03:14.610> should

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
first of all I believe that there should

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.190 
first of all I believe that there should
be<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> completion<00:03:15.420> escape<00:03:15.660> requirement

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
be a completion escape requirement

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.780 
be a completion escape requirement
because<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.830> completion<00:03:17.250> escape<00:03:17.520> should<00:03:17.700> be

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
because the completion escape should be

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.850 
because the completion escape should be
hard<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.150> get<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.080> slayer<00:03:19.380> challenge

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
hard to get this is a slayer challenge

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.229 
hard to get this is a slayer challenge
which<00:03:20.070> lists<00:03:20.400> all<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.760> solo<00:03:21.030> will<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
which lists all of the solo will be

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.150 
which lists all of the solo will be
losses<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.750> runescape<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.590> racks<00:03:22.830> or<00:03:22.980> is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
losses on runescape and a racks or is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.770 
losses on runescape and a racks or is
one<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> should<00:03:24.120> not<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.330> removed

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
one of them so it should not be removed

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.240 
one of them so it should not be removed
off<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.110> list<00:03:25.260> just<00:03:25.680> because<00:03:25.860> people

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
off of the list just because people

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.979 
off of the list just because people
think<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.549> difficult<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.480> solo<00:03:27.780> vos

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.509 
think it's difficult if it's a solo vos
you<00:03:28.200> should<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.590> able<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.950> do<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.370> own<00:03:29.489> a

you should be able to do it if you own a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.160 
you should be able to do it if you own a
completion<00:03:29.970> escape<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.780> can't<00:03:30.989> do<00:03:31.140> it

completion escape and if you can't do it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.990 
completion escape and if you can't do it
for<00:03:31.290> whatever<00:03:31.530> reason<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:31.980> maybe<00:03:32.430> then<00:03:32.880> you

for whatever reason that maybe then you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.370 
for whatever reason that maybe then you

don't mean to be mean but I'm just
bringing<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.610> point<00:04:02.790> if<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.330> don't<00:04:03.570> do<00:04:03.810> PDM

bringing up a point if you don't do PDM
in<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.320> first<00:04:04.500> place<00:04:04.620> there's<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.190> no

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
in the first place there's really no

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.430 
in the first place there's really no
point<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.940> having<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.269> completion<00:04:06.660> escape<00:04:06.959> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
point to having a completion escape the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.750 
point to having a completion escape the
only<00:04:07.709> reason<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.040> completion<00:04:08.370> escape<00:04:08.610> is

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
only reason the completion escape is

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.490 
only reason the completion escape is
good<00:04:08.970> is<00:04:09.150> because<00:04:09.330> it<00:04:09.540> has<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.870> best<00:04:10.049> stats<00:04:10.290> in

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
good is because it has the best stats in

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.319 
good is because it has the best stats in
the<00:04:10.590> Cape<00:04:10.769> slaw<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> mainly<00:04:12.180> used

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
the Cape slaw and that is mainly used

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.270 
the Cape slaw and that is mainly used
for<00:04:12.570> PVM<00:04:12.959> which<00:04:13.260> reflects<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.799> your<00:04:13.980> damage

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
for PVM which reflects on your damage

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
for PVM which reflects on your damage
bonus<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.760> your<00:04:14.880> armor<00:04:15.180> bonus<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.900> helps

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
bonus and your armor bonus and it helps

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.530 
bonus and your armor bonus and it helps
you<00:04:16.260> during<00:04:16.620> PBM<00:04:17.040> situations<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.419> why

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
you during PBM situations so that is why

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.569 
you during PBM situations so that is why
the<00:04:18.600> completion<00:04:19.019> escape<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.380> good<00:04:19.620> also<00:04:20.430> it

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the completion escape is good also it

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.949 
the completion escape is good also it
means<00:04:20.729> completionist<00:04:21.479> which<00:04:21.630> means<00:04:21.810> you've

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
means completionist which means you've

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.390 
means completionist which means you've
completed<00:04:22.380> pretty<00:04:22.680> much<00:04:22.830> everything<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
completed pretty much everything in the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.550 
completed pretty much everything in the
game<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.390> can't<00:04:24.599> do<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> rack<00:04:25.080> sore<00:04:25.320> or

if you think it's too difficult then I
don't<00:04:27.390> know<00:04:27.539> if<00:04:27.690> you

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
do we have to do this again when we just

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.629 
do we have to do this again when we just
did<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.530> for<00:04:49.560> Soul<00:04:49.860> Reaper<00:04:50.160> we<00:04:50.280> had<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.490> kill

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
did it for Soul Reaper we had to kill

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.070 
did it for Soul Reaper we had to kill
one<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.820> each<00:04:51.000> boss<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.450> Reaper<00:04:51.750> title

one of each boss for the Reaper title

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.480 
one of each boss for the Reaper title
why<00:04:52.410> do<00:04:52.470> we<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:52.740> any<00:04:52.800> other<00:04:53.070> completion

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
why do we have any other completion

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.620 
why do we have any other completion
escape<00:04:53.730> requirement<00:04:54.210> of<00:04:54.270> killing<00:04:54.510> these

bosses<00:04:54.870> which<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.830> definitely<00:04:56.340> agree<00:04:56.580> with

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
bosses which I definitely agree with

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.700 
bosses which I definitely agree with
it's<00:04:57.330> pretty<00:04:57.570> bad<00:04:57.780> timing<00:04:58.080> that<00:04:58.320> we<00:04:58.410> got<00:04:58.530> this

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
it's pretty bad timing that we got this

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.379 
it's pretty bad timing that we got this
Slayer<00:04:58.980> challenge<00:04:59.430> right<00:04:59.639> after<00:04:59.970> we<00:05:00.090> just<00:05:00.300> had

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
Slayer challenge right after we just had

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.270 
Slayer challenge right after we just had
Soul<00:05:00.630> Reaper<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.620> is<00:05:01.770> kind<00:05:02.070> of<00:05:02.250> just

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
Soul Reaper and it is kind of just

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.580 
Soul Reaper and it is kind of just
repetitive<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.540> kill<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> same<00:05:04.050> bosses<00:05:04.410> over

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
repetitive to kill the same bosses over

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.230 
repetitive to kill the same bosses over
and<00:05:04.680> over<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:05.010> mean<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.580> is<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.880> challenge

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
and over I mean this is a challenge

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.430 
and over I mean this is a challenge
where<00:05:06.389> you<00:05:06.419> get<00:05:06.630> d<00:05:06.810> buffs<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.229> have<00:05:07.350> to

to get it now it does suck because it

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.080 
to get it now it does suck because it
wasn't<00:05:58.320> my<00:05:58.470> fault<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.039> lost<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.550> but

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.760 
wasn't my fault that I lost it but
anyways<00:06:00.539> that's<00:06:00.960> pretty<00:06:01.139> much<00:06:01.320> what<00:06:01.500> applies

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
anyways that's pretty much what applies

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.320 
anyways that's pretty much what applies
here<00:06:02.100> if<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.370> did<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.610> once<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:02.880> can<00:06:02.970> do<00:06:03.210> it

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
here if you did it once you can do it

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.000 
here if you did it once you can do it
again<00:06:03.600> iraq's<00:06:04.200> or<00:06:04.380> isn't<00:06:04.650> that<00:06:04.770> hard

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
again iraq's or isn't that hard

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.920 
again iraq's or isn't that hard
especially<00:06:05.340> because<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.240> can<00:06:06.419> do<00:06:06.539> it<00:06:06.660> first

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
especially because you can do it first

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.629 
especially because you can do it first
which<00:06:07.200> means<00:06:07.440> you<00:06:07.560> have<00:06:07.710> no<00:06:07.950> d<00:06:08.190> buffs<00:06:08.430> it's

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.010 
which means you have no d buffs it's
just<00:06:08.850> like<00:06:08.910> doing<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.389> straight<00:06:09.630> out<00:06:09.660> the<00:06:09.870> gate

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
just like doing it straight out the gate

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.990 
just like doing it straight out the gate
just<00:06:10.260> going<00:06:10.830> there<00:06:10.919> normally<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.520> completing

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
just going there normally and completing

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.670 
just going there normally and completing
it<00:06:12.120> you<00:06:12.389> can<00:06:12.539> watch<00:06:12.690> guide<00:06:12.960> there's<00:06:13.289> tons<00:06:13.560> of

my perspective because it's easy for me
but<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.669> may<00:06:20.760> be<00:06:20.789> hard<00:06:21.300> for<00:06:21.479> someone<00:06:21.660> else<00:06:21.870> but

of a challenge it only takes about an

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.900 
of a challenge it only takes about an
hour<00:06:54.780> and<00:06:55.050> 30<00:06:55.350> minutes<00:06:55.560> max<00:06:55.920> it's<00:06:56.250> not<00:06:56.670> worth

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
hour and 30 minutes max it's not worth

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.300 
hour and 30 minutes max it's not worth
doing<00:06:57.120> for<00:06:57.480> Slayer<00:06:57.660> points<00:06:58.050> or<00:06:58.170> XP<00:06:58.620> you<00:06:59.160> can
