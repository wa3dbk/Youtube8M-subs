00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.419
 Did you know that scientists are already 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.059
 looking when we are going to be able to go to 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.059
 live the case that this planet 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.810
 my name is august from aviles 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.410
 this is interesting things 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.410
 ours 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.609
 these five extrasensory planets 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.009
 they have very living conditions 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.730
 similar to that of the earth according to 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.360
 scientists 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.670
 each of these planets could 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.510
 become a new homeland for the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.480
 humanity 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.430
 suggests trending is a note that I 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.409
 I find on the portal the news rt 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 under this video in the destruction 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:52.790
 I'm going to leave the link to the note so that 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.559
 you can spend what do you think you think 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.530
 the finally humans go to 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 destroy 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.840
 planet I'm going to make some asteroid 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 who tell us that he destroyed the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.430
 dinosaurs something is going to happen 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.200
 catastrophic as some flood 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.960
 the erupting volcanoes 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.570
 the inversion of the poles of a system 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.939
 electromagnetic what do you think of the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.530
 respect you want to tell us 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.750
 under this video I invite you to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.870
 comment on it I'm not 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.090
 affirming I supposed 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.820
 neither refuting anything just I'm 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.800
 expressing the happy to the note and I'm 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.980
 looking for your well-being 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.680
 let's go with the first of the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.320
 five or so-called planets that tell us 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.900
 the scientists that could be 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.510
 habitable in case the earth 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.040
 it ended up collapsing says 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:53.130
 the first is the kepler 186 efe is a 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 planet a little older than the earth with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.350
 ocean surface and mountains if 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
 become a new land for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.140
 humanity we would live to go years that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.150
 it would last 130 days 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.250
 that is the first of the planets the 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.990
 second of the planets that put 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.350
 name of the scientists class 6 67 cc 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.230
 it's about another planet similar to the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.900
 land that also has oceans and 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.260
 mountains 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.319
 besides years of 28 days the planet 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 will warm the lovers of the heat since 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:34.849
 according to astronomers the temperature of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.180
 16 67 cc is 40 degrees 40 degrees 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:42.049
 sunk kepler on the next planet 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 of the third escape 62 efe another kepler 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.099
 that is probably totally 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.769
 covered by water and have years of 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.299
 267 10 although it is fit for life the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.420
 fact that it does not have a 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.640
 land surface could complicate the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.980
 drawn 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.150
 the next planet we have in the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.120
 number 4 here that 8 32 c probably 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.760
 It is also completely filled with water 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.400
 although the temperature is identical to the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.930
 of the earth 36 days of ours 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.330
 are equivalent to a year in which 832 c and 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.180
 finally 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.440
 in the number 5 place is here 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.000
 go 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.400
 Scientists believe that this planet 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.310
 which is the closest to the earth and the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.480
 double of large is completely covered 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.450
 for mountains a year in captain equals 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.700
 48 days from ours this planet 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.970
 is first on the list 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.690
 among those who support the idea of 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.510
 move to live on another planet 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.140
 well then here is the subject of these 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.320
 planets of madryn to live elsewhere and 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.900
 Well I would like to mention about 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.380
 that's what the fuck we're looking for 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.080
 another fucking planet if we could not 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.000
 take care of what 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.010
 I say we have been able to take care of it because the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.950
 truth is that we humans 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.410
 Well, if we depend on chame too but 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.110
 the bed 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.510
 I've come across the milestones that they want 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.910
 destroy other species 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.100
 I've also come across rock and toxo 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.470
 has found with those who want 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.949
 destroy as so stimulating and all 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.129
 the resources we have to use them not 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:33.080
 we have found ourselves a kind of 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.319
 and my god of balance between the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.749
 nature the other species and we 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.119
 human beings living beings 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:43.069
 homo sapiens we call ourselves by 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:46.159
 intelligent beings we call ourselves 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.919
 when the truth we act like beasts 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:52.189
 worse than the beasts that we 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.559
 we name of the other species then 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:58.540
 says here that scientists are in 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:01.510
 search of other planets as for what 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.180
 as to destroy them the same as we have 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.889
 made with this we beings 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.650
 We act human cancer 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.819
 water more with a court that we are mushrooms 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.939
 predators 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.039
 we destroy other species we destroy 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.560
 our own express and we're going 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.129
 writing everything we found at 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.139
 reverse 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.659
 we do not build we believe that 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.429
 we build buildings portfolios the 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.399
 science advances to education advances not 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:31.619
 it is 111 recoil we gave him in the mother 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:35.249
 click planet we do not end up bailing 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:38.249
 his mother we destroyed him each 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.169
 with the shura with stupidity killing 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.899
 other humans killing other beings 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.700
 alive beating animals we do not know 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:47.390
 live in harmony 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.710
 the nature with what nature 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.510
 but 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.880
 because we are stupid we are 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.660
 adjusting other planets to encourage you 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.380
 my august name the thanks I hope 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.450

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.000
 let's make more goods we can be more 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.590
 professional also if I liked in 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.020
 twitter on twitter you find me more 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.330
 gÃ¡lvez newsletters on facebook gusto de 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.000
 les garrigues and here on youtube as a 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:24.980
 branch the note or interesting things we 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.980
 we see in the next see you later thank you
