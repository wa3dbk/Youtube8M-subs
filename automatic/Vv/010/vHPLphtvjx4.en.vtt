don't<00:03:34.160> know<00:03:34.310> who<00:03:34.550> was<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:34.970> craft<00:03:35.480> but

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
don't know who was in that craft but

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.470 
don't know who was in that craft but
this<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.440> case<00:03:36.680> is<00:03:36.920> strong<00:03:37.130> enough<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:38.240> at

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
this the case is strong enough to at

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.510 
this the case is strong enough to at
least<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:39.260> can<00:03:39.380> draw<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.680> conclusion<00:03:40.370> that

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
least we can draw the conclusion that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.610 
least we can draw the conclusion that
there<00:03:40.880> was<00:03:41.000> an<00:03:41.090> extremely<00:03:41.870> advanced

technology involved here and the obvious

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.840 
technology involved here and the obvious
question<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.890> who<00:03:46.310> owns<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.030> technology<00:03:48.850> I

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
question is who owns that technology I

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.290 
question is who owns that technology I
