00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.040
 finally I propose to decide on more 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.939
 one very important issue which 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.199
 of course care about the party 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:10.479
 people who follow politics 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:12.259
 but i mean 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.070
 decide on a candidate for 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.529
 position of president 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.109
 subject to the proposal will lead the list 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.119
 party 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210
 do party work 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.759
 and at tpu holiday performance on 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.579
 election 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.259
 my willingness to do 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.589
 practical work in government 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.220
 I think it would be right 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.750
 for the congress to support the candidacy 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.749
 party chairman Vladimir Putin 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.749
 as president of the country 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.300
 but these applause 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 gives me the right not to explain how 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.700
 experience and authority possesses Vladimir 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 Vladimir Putin 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.940
 decision he said on this topic 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.600
 I was asked all the time when you 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.710
 decide 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.010
 what are you children to people and sometimes me and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.180
 stroked them what they asked and you didn't 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.610
 quarreled with each other 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.100
 I want to fully confirm what 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 just been connected 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.910
 what we offer to the congress 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.240
 this is a deep decision 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.760
 and even more 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.560
 we really discussed this 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.309
 scenario 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.699
 still in the period when making haylage 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.879
 friendly union 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 and naturally the years proved 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.729
 and I really hope and most of our 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:20.949
 citizens 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.149
 the correctness of our strategy and 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:25.139
 the effectiveness of the current model 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:25.499
 of management
