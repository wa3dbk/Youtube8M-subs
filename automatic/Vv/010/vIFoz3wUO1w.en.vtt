00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.329
 good morning for you to take out the city of Miami again 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.689
 the beautiful coral live 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:19.039
 let's go to our second part of the pirate portan we talk about blow of 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 right we talk about the knicks 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.359
 in the first article we're going to talk phoenix 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.130
 of the practical part we are going to show what album in camos in the previous day 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.670
 he thinks we're going to start with the basic project that is no longer used 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.800
 the old cadet containing the professors 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.260
 of the clubs 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.860
 percent this scream I repeat it is not advisable to teach 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.440
 the future contract 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 remember that I speak 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.359
 pique the grip affect the 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.290
 moments later on point 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.700
 the distance with the body will affect the position of all 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 and the angle of the racket in this case the dgt is open 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.550
 therefore this is a bit complicated 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.890
 the most delayed contact point 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.650
 and the dynastic endings I repeat this scream 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.700
 practically is no longer used since it came from good we keep the limbo the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 existing expense this fact 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.110
 without dismissing the hand 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 famous shout 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.450
 and the classic that is recommendable for beginning students 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.229
 hence the point of contact explicitly in front of the body the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.229
 The role of the owner is already a little more mentioned than in the previous 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 we can not give the recipe remains perpendicular 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.370
 from the start of the back 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.340
 nor the termination can be 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.020
 over the shoulder 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.360
 file after you will visit for using this number one cry 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.790
 afterwards he indicated that if it is necessary to open again the de roger federer the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.900
 First article 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.140
 is a combination between this fact shown here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 and that in excellent or for me the best team the future 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.189
 of the foal with arzones 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.540
 normally it was announced that soon the terminations may vary 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.020
 and you can stick with all kinds of tapas 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.200
 defects 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.470
 then we have 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.660
 the cen and yours in that it is very common between eight years 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.040
 nor the youth players 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.409
 maiden lara that we know is more closed 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.949
 the end of the patient the preparation 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.129
 and the point of contact later swim the termination 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.509
 it's more around him 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.429
 It is an excellent and for all 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.909
 and then the most complicated crit and in question very extreme where the hand goes 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:24.769
 under 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.560
 and there everything continues as a-rod had selected the point of contact much 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.829
 later with the previous ones and it is practically impossible to hit the 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:32.769
 ball 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.469
 the position of the police station racket closed 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.149
 p and the point of contact 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.329
 onwards and a much lower completion 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.329
 in the previous product of the position of the doll 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.879
 so he terms the use so if we have a termination here the 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.829
 students are fine with this scream 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.309
 we visit to end up here very 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:55.309
 unnatural and will not favor acceleration 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 I want to emphasize the preparation for the initial position 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.399
 when we teach the professors hector larrea that you in front of the body the 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.119
 relaxed elbows 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.769
 note theme reketa perpendicular to the ground with tiger and intermediate point 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.170
 but we believe that the boys united many people extreme tepeyac olÃ­vica what 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:14.659
 what 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.909
 naturally you will place the racket in this fusion with the closed box 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.609
 from his hermitage well 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.979
 these players are not going to feel comfortable 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:26.829
 in this position holds is ok this avoided colleagues if not to the position 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.639
 initial is that way careful with the directive is well this is correct 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.919
 i will favor 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.639
 proper start 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.469
 this was all for six by the right-wing the next encounter we will 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.219
 of the club in very many fields
