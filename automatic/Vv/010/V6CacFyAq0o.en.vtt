00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
little towards the corners a bit but

00:03:58.790 --> 00:05:11.419 
little towards the corners a bit but
they're<00:03:59.260> way<00:04:00.260> back<00:04:00.950> in<00:04:01.280> there

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:11.429

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
and a half foot so what I found caught

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.049

good fish I got blowing off the lake
yesterday<00:05:27.159> but<00:05:28.089> I<00:05:28.149> decided<00:05:28.479> to<00:05:28.629> come<00:05:28.809> down

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
yesterday but I decided to come down

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.299 
yesterday but I decided to come down
south<00:05:29.609> and<00:05:30.609> it's<00:05:31.119> funny<00:05:31.509> how<00:05:31.949> shallow<00:05:32.949> water

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:33.309 
south and it's funny how shallow water

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.359 
south and it's funny how shallow water
can<00:05:33.579> be<00:05:33.669> such<00:05:33.879> a<00:05:33.909> nuance<00:05:34.419> because<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.409> find

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:36.369 
can be such a nuance because I find

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.729 
can be such a nuance because I find
isolated<00:05:37.360> patches<00:05:37.569> of<00:05:37.869> bull<00:05:38.049> rushes<00:05:38.319> hold
