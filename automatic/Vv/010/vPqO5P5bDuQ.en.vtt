 He much even that I above all that now is really that progress was meeting cormorants like this 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.110
 But 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.500
 I'm also a little surprised how are you entrust all where On'ni speaks 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.560
 It's like I'm talking a lot about it and it sounds like it sounds so bad 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:54.520

 That's right if you say yes, you 're right , but it's said that it's true . 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:26.110
 But it is my own to myself I just sing as a skater I just sing 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:30.039
 I thought that something so I think that we Stars wanted everyone to do so without permission that it does not suits 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.180
 It seems to say power of blood donation I thought helped a portion say word 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.729
 Seems to be 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.240

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:44.350
 Though the temporary voice which was aloud is a small voice 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.880
 Is not out things that if just that lip-synching also its sense of reality 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:51.310
 Hatari 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:54.460
 But whether this is I say I say I was a little hard to remember the lyrics that skating 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:58.270
 Everyone is frozen and flies when there is some motivation when doing 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:03.560
 The sound is loud Water or do you go down while listening to such music 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.490
 Sometimes I think I might say it, but I think it's really very annoying, though 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:11.910

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:19.289
