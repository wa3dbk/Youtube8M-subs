00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.310
 he is predestined for the car 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.820
 listening to the events in the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.439
 automobiles are extremely cheap it is the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.710
 small interior 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.350
 it's close to the speakers it 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.000
 There are no disturbing reflections because 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.510
 the distance is so small 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 all of which is very conducive to good 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.839
 sounded then we take the 1000 watts 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.600
 the power you have for something 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.860
 i know four cubic meters of enclosed space 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.260
 one has 16 channels team what 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.789
 to transfer fundamentals as you can in the 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 barely managed 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 in the car, we know exactly where the ears 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.570
 are and can sound like that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.060
 align that we are always the same 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.220
 have sound that you also understand 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.659
 if you can hear very soft music 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.750
 base still there 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.360
 that it is something very many people 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.610
 the first time listening to porsche music 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.979
 to perceive with our system 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.229
 this is not mouse music where you are 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 the high frequencies hears but it is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.020
 the entire bass foundation always 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020
 available 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.569
 porsche was very much in the foreground 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.149
 the weight but as you already handy 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.810
 finished with the soundsystem and that 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.479
 sound experience beyond doubt 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.609
 was you had to go again and ran to 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.130
 Every job was questioned whether 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.890
 you save a few grams of weight 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.039
 Any car can be tuned 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.689
 in a very lengthy process though 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.739
 the technology is perfect 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.549
 then we get positive emotions 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.959
 the driving experience is when the car is like that 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.239
 works as you wish 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.310
 you do not think about what is 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.379
 with the steering or with the with the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.150
 landing gear or whatever else is the same 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.920
 it's the music, even if it's not 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.220
 think more about what it means 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.290
 best thing it does with anything 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.530
 compressed or so they come to 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.660
 the content and then there are positive ones 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.609
 emotions 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.680
 we know of wives 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.530
 have noticed that the husbands 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 home came in the evening with the porsche 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.739
 and then sit in the car in front of the garage 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.750
 have stayed and does not work here 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.599
 have dropped out or have come up 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.859
 yes and the reason for that was just that 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.859
 piece of music was not over yet 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.400
 a big wish of mine is that the 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.819
 kiddies today only with too 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.830
 walk around the base and listen to mp3 music 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.409
 that you can sit in the car 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.099
 panamera or cayenne or macao and 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:21.099
 listen to your pieces in the car with a 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.099
 quality that they tear out the plugs 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.549
 b 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.830
