00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.030
 rings with beads 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.780
 these rings are extremely super 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 easy to do you do nothing 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.700
 but nothing at all and you have some rings 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.820
 as you want to do so 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.240
 to your liking and easy what else 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.160
 you can ask them to go to need bases 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.560
 to make rings this that comes with the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.949
 little circle where you put your finger 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.860
 I understand the ring and a little circle on top 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:42.300
 beaded metal 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.130
 and round those that you want white tail and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.860
 something that serves as support for 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.420
 hold the rings that are straight 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.360
 since we are going to the sides 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 you put what is going to be the ring the base 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 of the ring on the stand and now you 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.490
 we put white glue for all this 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.490
 metal circuit that covers it 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.940
 cover with the beads that you want me 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.720
 I have chosen these elongated of different 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.720
 colors all mixed 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 when I had discovered you put another 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.000
 white glue layer and then another layer 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.000
 of beads 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.420
 I do this because I like that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 get loaded with the beads if not 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 you want to put more than a layer of 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.750
 Beads simply pass to 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.120
 step assistant that is to put a layer 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.080
 last layer of white glue 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.080
 Y 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.150
 and now it's just waiting to wait 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.550
 which is since the white tail 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.920
 disappear and everything is well stuck and 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.670
 you will be so good with the beads 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.670
 that you have decided 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.810
 ah 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.730
 Here I show you this other ring that I have 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.119
 made using circle beads 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.920
 blue and white 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.770
 for this you can let our 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.380
 imagination and make them as you want 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.250
 the simplest thing simple and 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 customized 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.610
 and if you want to see another video how 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.640
 make rings this this ring is midi 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.860
 I leave this if you want to see it alone 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.820
