taking<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:48.030> proof<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:49.460> there's<00:00:50.460> one

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
taking this as proof now there's one

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.000 
taking this as proof now there's one
little<00:00:50.940> spot<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.680> just

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
little spot like right here that just

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
little spot like right here that just
barely<00:00:53.370> started<00:00:54.530> to<00:00:55.530> make<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> melt<00:00:56.070> spot<00:00:56.840> but<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
barely started to make a melt spot but I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.569 
barely started to make a melt spot but I
painted<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.649> whole<00:00:58.890> layout<00:00:59.719> with

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
painted this whole layout with

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.050 
painted this whole layout with
rust-oleum<00:01:02.690> Brown<00:01:03.690> camouflage<00:01:04.470> paint<00:01:05.060> only

rust-oleum Brown camouflage paint only
that's<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> can

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that's all it's on this and as you can

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
that's all it's on this and as you can
see<00:01:09.770> there's<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:10.979> no<00:01:11.610> melted<00:01:12.180> foam

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
see there's really no melted foam

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
see there's really no melted foam
anywhere<00:01:14.720> now<00:01:15.720> I'm<00:01:15.930> sure<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.369> decided<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
anywhere now I'm sure if you decided to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.280 
anywhere now I'm sure if you decided to
take<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.150> put<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> heavy<00:01:21.450> dose<00:01:21.810> across

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
take the can and put a heavy dose across

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920 
take the can and put a heavy dose across
your<00:01:22.590> foam<00:01:22.860> board<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.430> course<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.780> will

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
your foam board of course it will

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
your foam board of course it will
probably<00:01:25.259> melt<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.659> but<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:29.060> -

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
probably melt it but as you can see -

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
probably melt it but as you can see -
the<00:01:30.299> crap<00:01:31.079> laying<00:01:31.439> everywhere<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:34.490> would<00:01:35.490> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the crap laying everywhere I would not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
the crap laying everywhere I would not
worry<00:01:35.880> too<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.479> melting<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.259> foam

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
worry too much about melting your foam

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
worry too much about melting your foam
board<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.950> long<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.729> crazy<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
board as long as you don't get crazy if

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.069 
board as long as you don't get crazy if
