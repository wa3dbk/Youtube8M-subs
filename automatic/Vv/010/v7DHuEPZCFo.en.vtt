00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello here from cologne martin Graf von 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.099
 krolock first again and in this 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.330
 It should be an unusual 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.990
 important topic is often totally 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.429
 ignored and somehow in the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.179
 background is pushed by many 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.660
 photographers 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.160
 it is about the tiresome theme of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 screen the monitor calibration and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 there are already two in this topic 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 elements in it are very important 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 once it's the monitor's device 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.880
 itself and then it's the calibration 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.260
 I do not know why that is, but me 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.610
 know a lot of photographers and the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 Most care more about the new one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
 objectively in the new camera the three 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 or dissolve four megapixels more 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 as to the actual monitor on the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 mostly as a photographer more time 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 is spent as the actual 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 Of course, good camera is important with what 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.879
 You run around and what you do the photos 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 and there should be no blurring 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 photos come out but yes if you then 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.789
 pictures are developed and then if you can 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 lightroom capture one or photoshop 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.199
 whatever you use then you can 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.149
 actually make right patzer 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 I would say bigger patches than if 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.960
 a smaller camera or something 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 is buying worse lens nowadays 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 yes, but somehow not so sexy that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.049
 topic monitor calibration stuck yes 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.700
 also a lot of ominous dubious stuff 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.020
 Something you can do as a photographer somehow 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.740
 so try a little bit always 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.369
 repress 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.250
 I have the suffering one, the one that is suffering 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.420
 that I am not that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
 I unfortunately have the habit 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.500
 pulled black peter namely the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.240
 market until it print technicians and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.159
 has so much idea of ​​print and color 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 that I always somehow when he starts 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.079
 to talk to everything after five minutes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 neck sticks out with the theme though 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.950
 dearest saying always so easy 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.009
 is it all not explainable 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:47.579
 the theme color with profiles with color 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.460
 systems with systems with rgb total 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.960
 blatant but the important thing is for us 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.579
 photographers we have to at least one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320
 have understood a bit and we have to 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.479
 pay attention and value that it 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 is done right and b we have to do so 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.890
 let a little bit the church in the village 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 on some topics about color 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.250
 otherwise we always have the problem that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.960
 we do not even tackle it and not at all 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.640
 tackling is more difficult and worse 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.890
 at least try to tackle that 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.620
 we go and I want to go once 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.000
 word about why you lose 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.380
 color calibration color profile as 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.600
 photographer needs 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.190
 I have just opened the bridge 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
 adobe bridge and i have mine here 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.970
 Pictures the wedding shots and like me 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 look at such a picture here and said oh 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 là là that's a great bride short 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450
 here the buildings are centered with the whole 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 panorama framed but beautiful blue 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.670
 sky 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.860
 But who's to say because for the hangman 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.050
 actually that the blue is really so in 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.630
 the file is like I am here right now 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.340
 I see it while we have the year 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.110
 2015 I also believe that today 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.459
 device is not so wrong about that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.270
 it's a green and me in blue 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.310
 is shown 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.180
 but we as a photographer come with us 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 sometimes a bit on the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.320
 details on than just green or blue 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480
 but who says that's so easy 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.280
 matt to blue and not 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.320
 somehow such a stronger blue that the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.010
 Saturation and the color values ​​really 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.459
 that's right 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.800
 that is an extremely important thing and 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.450
 there comes just the color calibration the 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.800
 Monitor calibration with the game 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 in the end, it's about that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.550
 interplay if I have the file now 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.200
 finished and I send you to 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.760
 Drucker and I print them out ourselves 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.310
 and i will send you on to the customer 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.400
 or the colleague then provides the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.590
 color calibration for this or that 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600
 that we all see the same thing he does 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.489
 open the file and says drill looks on 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.620
 me as good as the krolop 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.150
 if I do not do that then send 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.980
 I have any question marks by the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.780
 this can end badly 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.090
 even if you assume that 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.410
 somehow a end customer the whole on the web 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.709
 look at any browser that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.120
 Profile can not represent 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.950
 it does not protect at least with itself 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.860
 to be neutral on his computer 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.010
 until it just leaves the system and 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.590
 This system of computer and monitor 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.299
 that is just the first and most important 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.450
 system because it comes from the camera 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.760
 directly into the computer and will then just 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.410
 processed is then finished and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.030
 then it should be ready someday and 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.680
 really agree and then leave 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.880
 the house and what happens each 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.320
 I can not do more than 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.770
 Photographers influence only until 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.620
 I have to do my job right there 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.130
 what must we value in the topic 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.690
 Monitor calibration first point and 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.150
 which is sometimes a little bit the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 I am in need of a device 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.040
 a dispenser in the case one 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.890
 monitor that is capable of anything 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.070
 the colors and the brightness the 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.890
 represent tonal values ​​as they are in the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.990
 that means the device is an element what 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.390
 is very important and then it comes 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.390
 second element added that this device 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.490
 no matter how well it is calibrated again 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.160
 and needs to be adjusted so that 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.300
 this color monitor values ​​if you are 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.070
 there can be asked and that 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.670
 they should really be that way 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.410
 become 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.670
 I can already anticipate you one thing 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.020
 we will follow in the route 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.240
 videos on a bit too 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.800
 a product recommendation come back it 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.590
 There are really only two possibilities 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.290
 you can choose with monitors 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.690
 once it is the company etc and then it is 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.570
 it's the company so that's the products 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.770
 if you would say yes if you are 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.300
 not want to buy the cheapest 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.580
 but really what clever buy 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.860
 would like to be international then only 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.170
 These two products brands 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.080
 there you can just make sure that you 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.940
 what gets decent and we have 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.670
 since eternity already so here in the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.980
 house and will be there one more time on it 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.540
 back that is also a something 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.800
 beginner emphasized solution and then there is 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.510
 of course, the ultra profi 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.910
 solution I you both again in 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.770
 Show this route if that 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.630
 that shows then I have to 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.520
 make sure that's it too 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.630
 indicating there are the calibrations 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.820
 then there is no software hardware 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.010
 bremen and we just do it now 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.320
 in the following these whole steps 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.760
 you should get out of this video 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.740
 first have taken out the 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.290
 importance at all the right one 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.169
 to have calibrated the engine correctly 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.450
 this is your job as a photographer of things 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.100
 to edit so that you see what 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.110
 in the file and that's her 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.750
 you can also give what you see 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:14.030
 if that is not the case, then do it 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.030
 her russian roulette with photoshop
