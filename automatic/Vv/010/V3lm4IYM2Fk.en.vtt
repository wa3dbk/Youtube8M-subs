Tesla<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> tesla<00:00:27.060> model<00:00:27.090> x<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> would

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
Tesla the tesla model x and you would

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.330 
Tesla the tesla model x and you would
think<00:00:28.019> being<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> tesla<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
think being a tesla it's all gonna be

about<00:00:29.580> electrification<00:00:30.119> how<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> car<00:00:31.260> moves

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
about electrification how the car moves

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
about electrification how the car moves
under<00:00:31.859> battery<00:00:32.070> power<00:00:32.460> only<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.090> how<00:00:33.149> fast<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
under battery power only and how fast it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630 
under battery power only and how fast it
is<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.140> surprisingly<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> tesla<00:00:35.250> message

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is but surprisingly the tesla message

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
is but surprisingly the tesla message
here<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.300> much<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.510> practicality<00:00:37.380> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
here is as much about practicality and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
here is as much about practicality and
usability<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.570> drives

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
usability as it is about what drives

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.069 
usability as it is about what drives
this<00:00:40.079> vehicle<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.879> fact<00:00:41.879> founder<00:00:42.390> Elon<00:00:42.540> Musk

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
this vehicle in fact founder Elon Musk

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.290 
this vehicle in fact founder Elon Musk
goes<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.680> far<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> say<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.730> car<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.120> be

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
goes so far as to say this car will be

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
goes so far as to say this car will be
mini<00:00:45.629> vans<00:00:45.899> SUVs<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:47.370> even<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> current<00:00:48.270> 911

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

mini vans SUVs and even the current 911
all<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.440> their<00:00:49.620> own<00:00:49.770> games<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
all at their own games I think it is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.299 
all at their own games I think it is
just<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.899> provides<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> whole<00:00:52.920> new<00:00:53.039> level<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
just it provides a whole new level of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.779 
just it provides a whole new level of
functionality<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.030> no<00:00:54.239> minivan<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.649> no<00:00:56.070> SUV

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
functionality that no minivan and no SUV

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.760 
functionality that no minivan and no SUV
have<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.809> most<00:00:57.989> distinctive<00:00:58.440> thing<00:00:58.500> you'll

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
have the most distinctive thing you'll

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
have the most distinctive thing you'll
