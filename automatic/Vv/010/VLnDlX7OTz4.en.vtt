00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.110
 a negotiation committee of the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.089
 also with representatives from the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.010
 was received yesterday by the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.770
 Governor which was not delivered to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.529
 proposal for readjustment 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.410
 our tables and today we meet 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.240
 in an assembly to really evaluate 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.400
 The board's proposal was even 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 take to the regional assemblies to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 that the category could evaluate more 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.239
 caution but there was a referral in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 which today the category already feels 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 conditions for evaluating this proposal 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 this proposal is clear how we have a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 quite variable career structure 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.340
 so we can not define which is 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 the percentage each teacher will 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.570
 find within this proposal that we 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.469
 we will present these tables in our 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.899
 site 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.180
 but roughly we have as 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.640
 proposal that was approved at the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.869
 by the category that you have a variation 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 from 23 point 23.8 percent to 24.11 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.650
 who just have a te class regency 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.020
 give to there in Enio and half of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.549
 has a variation ranging from 25 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.080
 points 98 to 33 with 82 and it is clear that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.630
 The cases also have those 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 teachers who are about 3000 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.890
 teachers who have not had dengue 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.979
 if you suffer 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.720
 readjust the much greater effect on some 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.310
 cases reaching a higher percentage 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.520
 to 60% 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.979
 but it is a framework that is a minority with 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.830
 so many people should focus on the percentage 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.160
 which corresponds to the majority of the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.619
 category for 2013 with the exception of 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.780
 teachers who do not have en enem 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.960
 no teacher will have an adjustment with 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.110
 index below the functional visa 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.930
 therefore the approved proposal was the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 incorporation of ideas plus the 15% 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.360
 there is an effect of around 25% but 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.479
 three years the tedency being incorporated 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.239
 at the end of a year and in March 2014 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.940
 await the completion of the merger of 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.209
 100% until you think the built-in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.250
 therefore it is the initial proposal that in 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.320
 four years we were able to reverse 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.300
 for two years and now for one year and 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.239
 this category is to be congratulated plus one 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.220
 time for your determination 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.019
 attending the meetings to understand 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.329
 a process that the club's board of directors 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.299
 established prioritizing the process 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.280
 negotiation seeking progress but not 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.140
 we can not register that the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.299
 result of this negotiation 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.640
 of course it is the result of our strike 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.239
 of this category in the year 2012 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.640
 with 52 days of struggle that were 52 days 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.040
 exhaustive but wants today we can 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.200
 understand that it was worth it that he is gone 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.420
 of sacrifice and it is clear that the struggle 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.990
 We continue our list is open 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.570
 many other points to be overcome 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.820
 it's just another step an isonomy 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.440
 so we still have a lot to fight and the 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.360
 category is to be congratulated and now it is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.770
 accompany the legislative chamber to 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.110
 vote on the bill to ensure 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.650
 our rights with the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.650
 our fight
