00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
running out or a couple years ago we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.240 
running out or a couple years ago we
just<00:02:25.450> walked<00:02:25.690> right<00:02:25.780> up<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.290> got<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.650> now

just walked right up and just got it now
I<00:02:27.280> guess<00:02:27.550> if<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> word<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.630> spreading<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.590 
I guess if the word is spreading and
everyone<00:02:29.440> wants<00:02:29.620> their<00:02:29.740> free<00:02:29.950> Lego<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:31.420> this
