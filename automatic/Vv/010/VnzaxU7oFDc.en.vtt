00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.690
 in this tutorial in this video os 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.240
 I will teach how to make two cuts steps 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.440
 fixed perez taveras chopping the first 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.440
 cut would cut it 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.090
 he has seen that we have cut 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.060
 You need here, look here because it's still 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.200
 being head of the polytechnics 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.200
 this would be the first and the second would be 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.200
 A) Yes 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:44.180
 first and the are two pretty cuts 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.970
 simple signifiers now that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 we are starting and good for the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.890
 first that is this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.879
 would take it with the thumb the heart and 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 on the moon it would be all these three 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.930
 same 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.930
 yes 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.160
 you put it in your left hand the good 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.970
 the right and then place well more or 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.240
 less 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:20.410
 here you put it with your thumb and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.260
 with the heart and the thumb of the hand 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.880
 right you are going to take a taquito 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:32.310
 while it's right on the face down 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.600
 hit and lower the ground 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.350
 how is he dead 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.350
 place 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.210
 once 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.750
 we take it 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:52.880
 to the heart 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.180
 we put the phalanges in half towards 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.180
 down 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:10.060
 and that's it, it's getting faster and the 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.060
 another the other is also very simple 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.930
 efe 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.990
 with the thumb below the index of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.950
 heart and the place above you make a 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.950
 taquito with the limit 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:34.640
 lopez 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.640
 below the index 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.930
 in the middle 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.880
 with that the one above 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.200
 and finally below 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.200
 and we will do 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.610
 others 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.700
 another is with him and we place him 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 we already have the tacos in each one 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.930
 we look for in the middle that is the medium 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.610
 will always have 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.300
 I walk 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.300
 this 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.840
 OK 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.170
 the best advice would be to do these 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.170
 cuts 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.620
 and now we cut again 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.469
 and the cuts 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.710
 it's a machine 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.390
 and simply the cuts come 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.630
 pretty good at the time of video we're going to 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.630
 cut 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.110
 knowing that it is down 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.979
 but good only
