black and blue one and a white and black

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.749 
black and blue one and a white and black
one<00:00:10.050> which<00:00:10.620> kind<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.889> made<00:00:11.070> me<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.639> it

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
one which kind of made me think that it

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.390 
one which kind of made me think that it
was<00:00:12.030> actually<00:00:12.179> white<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.719> black<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.950> have

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
was actually white and black but I have

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
was actually white and black but I have
proof<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.000> black<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.570> blue<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.719> I'll

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
proof that it is black and blue and I'll

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.140 
proof that it is black and blue and I'll
show<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.350> right<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:16.650> basically<00:00:17.520> the

to go ahead and increase the color

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.369 
to go ahead and increase the color
balance<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:47.190> off<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.260> right<00:00:49.260> now

as<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:51.059> looks<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
as you can see it looks just like the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
as you can see it looks just like the
picture<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.680> question<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.370> what's<00:00:53.850> happening

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
picture in question and what's happening

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.619 
picture in question and what's happening
is<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.770> dress<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.070> black<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.879> blue<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
is that dress is black and blue and the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
is that dress is black and blue and the
black<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.199> overexposed<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.430> kind<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
black is overexposed so it's kind of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
black is overexposed so it's kind of
making<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.149> less<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> shot<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.350> more<00:01:01.559> like

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
making it less of a shot of a more like

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
making it less of a shot of a more like
a<00:01:01.770> mid-tone<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.699> fact<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> color

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
a mid-tone the fact that the color

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.149 
a mid-tone the fact that the color
balance<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.350> really<00:01:04.559> tungsten

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
balance is off it's really tungsten

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.520 
balance is off it's really tungsten
really<00:01:05.339> warm<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.479> making<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> black<00:01:07.170> kind

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
really warm it's making the black kind

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.859 
really warm it's making the black kind
of<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.860> look<00:01:08.100> brownish<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.939> goldish<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
of like look brownish or goldish for the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
of like look brownish or goldish for the
blue<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.470> fact<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.010> overexposed<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
blue the fact that it's overexposed is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.429 
blue the fact that it's overexposed is
kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> washing<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.930> making<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
kind of washing it out making it a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
kind of washing it out making it a
little<00:01:13.560> lighter<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.430> fact<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
little lighter and the fact that the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
little lighter and the fact that the
color<00:01:15.540> balance<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.229> warm<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.920> opposed

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
color balance is really warm as opposed

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.210 
color balance is really warm as opposed
to<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.880> normal<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.799> cancels

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to really like normal it kind of cancels

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.990 
to really like normal it kind of cancels
out<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> blue<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.119> bit<00:01:21.360> since<00:01:21.600> blue<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
out the blue a little bit since blue and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
out the blue a little bit since blue and
yellow<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> opposites<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> what

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
yellow are sort of opposites and what

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
yellow are sort of opposites and what
that<00:01:26.310> does<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.630> makes<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> look<00:01:28.200> like

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that does is it just makes it look like

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.800 
that does is it just makes it look like
a<00:01:28.439> lighter<00:01:28.799> blue<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> some<00:01:30.000> people<00:01:30.450> they

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
a lighter blue so to some people they

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
a lighter blue so to some people they
kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> see<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.040> color<00:01:32.250> balance<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
kind of see it as the color balance is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.600 
kind of see it as the color balance is
too<00:01:33.509> cool<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.590> white<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.979> gold<00:01:35.220> image

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
too cool and it's a white and gold image

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
too cool and it's a white and gold image
and<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.140> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> coming<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> like

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and it's just kind of coming out to like

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
and it's just kind of coming out to like
have<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> blue<00:01:38.820> hue<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.570> is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
have like a blue hue but it actually is
white<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> opposite<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> image

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
white really it's the opposite the image

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.120 
white really it's the opposite the image
is<00:01:41.820> too<00:01:42.030> warm<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.680> black<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
is too warm it actually is black and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
is too warm it actually is black and
blue<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.000> causing<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.390> look<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
blue and it's just causing to look like

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.760 
blue and it's just causing to look like
that<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.930> could<00:01:46.079> prove<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> even

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
that and I could prove that to you even

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
that and I could prove that to you even
more<00:01:46.799> by<00:01:47.340> looking<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> background<00:01:48.030> which

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
more by looking at the background which

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
more by looking at the background which
you<00:01:49.170> can't<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.470> tell<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you can't really tell because of that

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.260 
you can't really tell because of that
color<00:01:50.220> balance<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.729> cameras<00:01:51.090> off<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
color balance on this cameras off a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
color balance on this cameras off a
little<00:01:51.509> bit<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> background<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
little bit but the background is kind of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.999 
little bit but the background is kind of
warm<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.850> well<00:01:54.210> does<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> suggest

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
warm as well does that kind of suggest

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
warm as well does that kind of suggest
that<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> color<00:01:56.490> balance<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.240> too<00:01:57.299> warm

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
that the color balance is way too warm

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.530 
that the color balance is way too warm
oh<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.460> that's<00:01:59.880> why<00:02:00.060> everything

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
oh and it is and that's why everything

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.980 
oh and it is and that's why everything
looks<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:02.130> fucking<00:02:02.430> blue<00:02:02.549> so

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
looks like that and it's fucking blue so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.399 
looks like that and it's fucking blue so
there<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.960> no<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.110> black<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
