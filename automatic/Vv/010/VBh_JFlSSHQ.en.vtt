00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.419
 unlike other mobile platforms 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:11.419
 android allows you to ping yourself along 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.129
 across but of such magnitude with which it 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.829
 pumped the company lg 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.730
 I have not met a crying company 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.590
 optimus g 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.720
 it seems the whole consists of only 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.060
 chips despite the swift 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.280
 increasing display sizes output to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.860
 one screen of two programs at the same time 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.930
 a rare phenomenon but sometimes it happens 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.210
 useful for example when during 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.920
 watching a football game you want 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.170
 share your opinion on orbit in 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.670
 social network in a lie elegantly decided 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.739
 issue of simultaneous output of two 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 applications one of them can be done 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.739
 transparent this function kyu slide and 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.230
 through it see the second by the way will same 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.180
 There are such cute headphones with 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.020
 premium sound great for 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.280
 asset g 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.290
 and if there is a TV by chance 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.809
 the picture can be transferred to it from 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.220
 smartphone and directly without wires from 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.080
 using the function with the poetic name 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.080
 dual screen dead 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.960
 watch football on the big screen and 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.360
 from smartphone 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.020
 and at the same time you use on 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.450
 optimus g 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 any applications and services can this 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.090
 I write about the judge about the involvement of photos 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.400
 two fingers in smartphones everything is already 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.340
 of course they heard and saw a little the same 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.229
 the most to do with the video of others 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.979
 I have not seen such a smartphone 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.840
 optimus g 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.470
 this can be done in the same way 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.450
 move to increase fragment 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.580
 five times and you can choose and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.910
 move the window around the screen 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.300
 without loss of quality and while you look at 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.820
 screen 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.680
 he is not extinguished like some optimus g 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.750
 recognizes when face or eyes 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 is opposite the screen so you can 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.450
 don't worry about locking every two 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:13.190
 minutes well here i turn aside 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:15.320
 and the screen goes off automatically well and 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.070
 Of course there is an old kind function 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.560
 quick memo 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.900
 branded and already familiar to smartphones 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.300
 lg with it you can take a screenshot 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.560
 screen sign them and send where 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.130
 anywhere here is optimus g 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.650
 powerful fast elegant concise but 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.709
 having a lot of lotion program which 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.150
 make life with android easier and more fun 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.989
 By the way, optimize already except black 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.590
 there is still in the white case 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.060
 I almost forgot covers for everyone 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.220
 colors have their case 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.470
 each one is so cute close up 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.470
 now everything is ok
