what<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.319> want<00:02:51.530> for<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.830> winter<00:02:52.250> boot<00:02:52.489> there<00:02:52.790> is

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
what you want for a winter boot there is

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.300 
what you want for a winter boot there is
I<00:02:53.209> think<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.750> about<00:02:53.930> 200<00:02:54.380> grams<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.830> insulation

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
I think is about 200 grams of insulation

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.550 
I think is about 200 grams of insulation
right<00:02:55.760> through<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.150> boot<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:57.140> is<00:02:57.170> quite

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
right through the boot which is quite

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.290 
right through the boot which is quite
nice<00:02:57.800> for<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.190> winter<00:02:58.610> boot<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.090> quite

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
nice for a winter boot and quite

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.690 
nice for a winter boot and quite
important<00:02:59.959> however<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.650> boot<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.040> breathable

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
important however the boot is breathable

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.160 
important however the boot is breathable
so<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> reckon<00:03:02.450> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.690> summer<00:03:02.959> you're

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
so I reckon in the summer you're

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.360 
so I reckon in the summer you're
probably<00:03:03.410> going<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.739> get<00:03:03.860> away<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.280> this

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
probably going to get away with this

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.080 
probably going to get away with this
boot<00:03:04.610> as<00:03:04.790> well<00:03:06.190> we'll<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.459> try<00:03:07.670> that<00:03:07.880> in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
boot as well we'll have to try that in

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.759 
boot as well we'll have to try that in
the<00:03:08.209> summer<00:03:08.480> we'll<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.230> kind<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.739> a

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
the summer we'll have to kind of do a

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.920 
the summer we'll have to kind of do a
come<00:03:10.250> back<00:03:10.489> video<00:03:13.090> like<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:14.269> say<00:03:14.480> B<00:03:14.750> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
come back video like I say B and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.740 
come back video like I say B and
breathable<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.069> summer<00:03:16.310> should<00:03:17.090> get<00:03:17.630> away

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
breathable in the summer should get away

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.170 
breathable in the summer should get away
with<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.230> hopefully<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:19.430> do<00:03:19.640> because<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.150> is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
with it hopefully we do because it is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.120
