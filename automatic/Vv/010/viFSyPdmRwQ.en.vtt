night

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.780 
night
to<00:00:15.890> make<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> running<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> little<00:00:17.400> richer<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
to make it running a little richer and

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.630 
to make it running a little richer and
it<00:00:17.910> definitely<00:00:18.480> runs<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.780> ton<00:00:19.080> better<00:00:19.640> throttle

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
it definitely runs a ton better throttle

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.460 
it definitely runs a ton better throttle
response<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.410> so<00:00:22.410> much<00:00:22.590> better<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.190> just

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
response is so much better and just

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
response is so much better and just
overall<00:00:25.470> runs<00:00:25.830> better<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.400> doesn't<00:00:26.730> pop<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
overall runs better and doesn't pop and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.189 
overall runs better and doesn't pop and
sputter<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.170> anything<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.770> revs<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
sputter or anything it just revs up and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.369 
sputter or anything it just revs up and
sounds<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.350> it<00:00:31.619> should<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.929> think<00:00:33.929> it's<00:00:34.079> maybe

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
sounds like it should I think it's maybe

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.340 
sounds like it should I think it's maybe
on<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.769> tad<00:00:35.609> rich<00:00:35.879> side<00:00:36.179> yet<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on this tad rich side yet because of the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.919 
on this tad rich side yet because of the
pipes<00:00:37.859> are<00:00:38.069> just<00:00:39.050> basically<00:00:40.050> drilled<00:00:40.499> out<00:00:41.929> but

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
pipes are just basically drilled out but

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.910 
pipes are just basically drilled out but
for<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.530> most<00:00:43.679> part<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.069> pretty<00:00:44.429> well<00:00:45.359> done

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
for the most part it's pretty well done

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.200 
for the most part it's pretty well done
how<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.949> want<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.519> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.940> paint<00:00:48.089> the

same<00:00:55.859> as<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> exhaust<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.639> took<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> exhaust

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
same as the exhaust it took the exhaust

my bike and the tank is also from that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:02:13.820 
my bike and the tank is also from that
bike

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.940 

so<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:16.300> cold<00:02:16.540> yet<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.890> that's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so it's a little cold yet but so that's

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.490 
so it's a little cold yet but so that's
why<00:02:18.160> it's<00:02:18.310> tumbled<00:02:18.730> I'm<00:02:19.690> getting<00:02:20.020> I<00:02:20.230> just

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
why it's tumbled I'm getting I just

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.780 
why it's tumbled I'm getting I just
wrote<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.770> around<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.010> little<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> backyard

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
wrote it around a little in the backyard

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.699 
wrote it around a little in the backyard
and<00:02:21.970> almost<00:02:22.630> all<00:02:22.840> over<00:02:23.130> 14,000<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.709> that's

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
