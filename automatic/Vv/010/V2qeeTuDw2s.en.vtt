00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.840 
little mac book sitting there and it's
plugged<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:18.390> outlet<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.990> there<00:02:19.850> but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
plugged up to that outlet up there but

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.420 
plugged up to that outlet up there but
our<00:02:21.030> wiring<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.470> yours<00:02:22.800> every<00:02:23.070> bit

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
our wiring is just like yours every bit

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.360 
our wiring is just like yours every bit
of<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.820> comes<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.959> from<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.680> inverter<00:02:26.070> up

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
of it comes in from that inverter up

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.660 
of it comes in from that inverter up
there<00:02:26.580> which<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.850> can't<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.920> he<00:02:28.920> goes<00:02:29.160> from

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
there which you can't see he goes from

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
there which you can't see he goes from
the<00:02:29.850> batteries<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.480> inverter<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> gives

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the batteries to that inverter and gives

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.120 
the batteries to that inverter and gives
us<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.370> same<00:02:32.580> power<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:34.950> your

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
us the same power that you have in your

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.900 
us the same power that you have in your
house<00:02:36.020> everything's<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.200> same<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.910> that's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
house everything's the same so that's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.360 
house everything's the same so that's
the<00:02:39.150> way<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.570> go<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.650> feel<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:41.190> more

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the way we go because I feel it's more

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
the way we go because I feel it's more
efficient<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.840> cheaper<00:02:43.320> cuz

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
efficient to go that way in cheaper cuz

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.400 
efficient to go that way in cheaper cuz
if<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.459> were<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.700> be<00:02:44.820> running<00:02:45.030> 12<00:02:45.450> volt<00:02:45.840> power

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
if I were to be running 12 volt power

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.970 
if I were to be running 12 volt power
through<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> whole<00:02:47.100> house<00:02:47.420> these<00:02:48.420> lines

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
through the whole house these lines

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.680 
through the whole house these lines
would<00:02:49.980> all<00:02:50.160> be<00:02:50.370> huge

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
would all be huge

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.980 
would all be huge
every<00:02:52.470> bit<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:54.660> ground

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
every bit of it you see that we ground

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.630 
every bit of it you see that we ground
hours<00:02:55.320> with<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> big<00:02:55.770> old<00:02:55.920> piece<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.130> copper

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
hours with a big old piece of copper

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.610 
hours with a big old piece of copper
just<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.360> yours<00:02:57.390> down<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.170> copper

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
just like you do yours down to a copper

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.930 
just like you do yours down to a copper
rod<00:02:59.150> but<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.240> wirings<00:03:00.660> simple<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.190> 110

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
rod but the wirings simple it's a 110

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.640 
rod but the wirings simple it's a 110
wired<00:03:03.420> home<00:03:04.520> every<00:03:05.520> bit<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:06.650> nothing

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
wired home every bit of it nothing

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 
wired home every bit of it nothing
different<00:03:07.890> than<00:03:08.070> your<00:03:08.340> house<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:09.150> only<00:03:09.630> major

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
different than your house the only major

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.490 
different than your house the only major
difference<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.860> we<00:03:11.490> get<00:03:11.670> our<00:03:11.820> power<00:03:12.380> from<00:03:13.380> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
difference is we get our power from the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.650 
difference is we get our power from the
Sun<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.100> wind<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:18.300> people

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
Sun and the wind that's it so the people

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.510 
Sun and the wind that's it so the people
who<00:03:18.780> were<00:03:18.900> wondering<00:03:19.410> how<00:03:19.770> much<00:03:20.010> difference

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
who were wondering how much difference

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.960 
who were wondering how much difference
it<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:21.030> live<00:03:21.180> off<00:03:21.420> grid<00:03:22.550> you've<00:03:23.550> got<00:03:23.790> to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it is to live off grid you've got to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.960 
it is to live off grid you've got to
watch<00:03:24.180> what<00:03:24.950> items<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.040> have<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> power

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
watch what items you have in the power

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.350 
watch what items you have in the power
consumption<00:03:27.540> they<00:03:28.080> have
