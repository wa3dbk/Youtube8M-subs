00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 a few days ago I showed you up 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:12.389
 instagram these christmas balls made at 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.759
 home as the bowls the kindergarten balls of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.150
 christmas snowballs snowballs 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.800
 and since this year I am 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.060
 giving a lot as I told you too 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 in the other video al al view it yourself 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 found this nice site where he explained 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.520
 how to make these snowballs is certain 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.899
 I was wrong because I'll show you later 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 unfortunately I haven't found one 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.090
 but a suitable solution is a nice thing 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 in short, to be used as a decoration 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 since this year the money for 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.770
 consumed there was no I am not that is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 all Italians don't have much 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 lyre and then we can do it by not e 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.329
 thus things concur serve of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.789
 empty parents or someone there 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.840
 jam this one another thing 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.070
 I don't remember this coop lady o 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.880
 optional is an option 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.860
 ie snow spray then by the Chinese o 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 find the poor euro on stage 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 this is not hicks fathers birthplace of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.720
 polystyrene and then no underpasses of 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.900
 snow, however, today there is no mother who me 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 corrects certain pa and you are puppets 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.790
 in polystyrene produced these little things 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 so Christmas just like native Esmon 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.090
 I don't know why I had a malformation 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.700
 mourinho the Christmas package the sapling 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.240
 zucchini is essential to her a 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 what I don't understand because here but discolored 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.770
 oh well veils to count the abbatterne 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.920
 you really need liquid glycerine 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.290
 very little can be found in health food stores 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.689
 then shine these white ones 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.370
 or argentario I prefer whites 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.280
 because they make an effect a little more 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.890
 this very well and this one was a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.460
 error in quotes I did 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.620
 because that is all the parts 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 because the classic fake snow though 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.590
 being polystyrene I didn't arrive 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.540
 to the reasoning that then floats 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.630
 practically the hard snow effect 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:24.560
 very little and you can see what they do 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.120
 right away, however, that we are his ha 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 a brillant effect lasts a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.080
 in short, a little more 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.480
 and then of course we'll need the gun 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.940
 in the hot glue then first 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.490
 what of course we have to find the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.530
 various each label from the jar 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.110
 obviously more doubles are bigger and more 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.710
 you can insert more things because in fact 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.160
 our things must be attached to the base 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.480
 of the cap which is then inserted and turned over 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.790
 obviously also do the test for 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.610
 see if for example the light mentions it 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.570
 once this cross is attached 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.550
 statello velo then we will risk 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.770
 so now I am free to create 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.530
 a composition to then stick on 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.720
 important cap that you calculate well a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.820
 also calculate the size well 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.290
 because without good giving I can 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.530
 put it here because then watched from 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.050
 closes the jar one minute closes 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.770
 so a snowman is fine 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.660
 maybe two I don't know how to start a 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.660
 snowman before putting the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.390
 hot gun I prepare everything for you 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.660
 the composition for example mother who 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.840
 was giving the idea of ​​putting it going 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.959
 looking for all my little ones 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.489
 vineyards and woods and parks so-so 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.190
 families we can safely 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.170
 even attack almost 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.450
 to buy something that does the 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.650
 in short, we were talking about the tree 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.650
 pine cone is made only downwards 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.560
 so now that I've attacked them all 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.840
 how many parts do I recompose more or 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.239
 less the idea what I want to do 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.450
 now on the hill I see everything on 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.690
 base of the lid we are from the tree 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.690
 here 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:41.090
 now from a poorly made Santa Claus 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:52.560
 and here it is done here it dries 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.530
 immediately, however, we leave it a little in 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.850
 a part because now we move on to 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.240
 part under 15 net a nice amount 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.000
 of glitter because first mistake not 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.630
 ce do it again emits a ramente 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.170
 very little of this 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.430
 polystyrene because I had not said no 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:20.130
 does not float float wheel 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:24.960
 in short, in the water, now net 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:27.660
 fateful water obviously I don't fill it 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.390
 all of you expect already as it flutters 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.590
 some small pieces of clothing fly on others 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.160
 no 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.690
 however, do not fill to the brim 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.510
 because first we have to put a 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:44.660
 little of vigilant na but really a 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.660
 cap will see though 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:57.500
 because as far as I understand the glycerin 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:06:00.990
 makes the water consistency or more 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.210
 dense so it flutters better I don't know 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:09.540
 I know now it's drowning time and 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:14.330
 is that when I told him he had to stay 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.330
 attentive to size 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:27.190
 tighten goes well well well and you 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:31.150
 flips the no snow is that if 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.970
 you may want to not show this 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.450
 here even if it is as beautiful as the bottom of the 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.170
 jar you can sprinkle a little 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.130
 snow then to our snowball 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.530
 made them home showed 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.180
 Here is already done half a mast in Kansas well 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.670
 a piece has already come off because 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.010
 indeed this is the protocol 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.400
 I imagined detached twigs and you no more 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:01.120
 with the criminal one occurred 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.070
 divinely I had to do it having put the 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.620
 photo exist you have 2000 requested 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.660
 in many and I wanted to do some but 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.880
 now how the pine cone has come off here 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.500
 dialogue water that floats though does 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.450
 effect also effect 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.520
 floats the missing pieces of the DVD 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:20.200
 or let me know if you do it and you 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.800
 I send a kiss and see you next 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.800
 video
