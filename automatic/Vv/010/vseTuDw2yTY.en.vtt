00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.889
 Hello everyone today I want to talk about 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.609
 zero resistance filters 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.800
 who often calls nulevik so the first 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.609
 what I want to say for anything at all 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.039
 I put the filter my own 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 the filter which is in the frame here it is 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.560
 presented as known to shoot or 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.710
 many problems it is very convenient to clean it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.140
 in this native filters I travel 3000 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 kilometers and began to notice that the moped 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.020
 started to work worse, less pull 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.940
 not advised to see if I have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 filter 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.320
 for a very long time I tried to take it off 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.910
 It turned out not very convenient 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 disassemble the floor of the moped to him 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 get it I look like not only 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.210
 cut this rubber thing off when i 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 finally pulled this filter discovered 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.400
 very unpleasant picture the whole filter in 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 the middle was full of dust 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.710
 if you see the sample now 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.710
 to show 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.390
 so well, the filter element itself I already 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.640
 threw away since he was away away killed so 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.290
 let after which it was decided to take the most 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.220
 Cheap nulevik here it is in the price for sure 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.470
 I do not remember but one of the cheapest that I 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.310
 I want to say about him his pros and cons 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.460
 well what is the plus of this filter 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.820
 he is very easy maintenance easy him 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.740
 take off the minus brush as I would 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.810
 that the moped started louder 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.050
 work his sound became like a sound 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.600
 tractor basically nothing more 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.300
 did not notice since he was shooting in the middle 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.660
 and did not lubricate just well, I really 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.500
 I like him very comfortably often 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.670
 saw pictures of that knee 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.400
 rearrange 180 degrees and carburetor 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.930
 as if looking in the wing filter is also not 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.900
 did not like it so took 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.310
 by itself a small filter to the forest 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.160
 that's the distance what else do I want to say 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.140
 often seen such information that quickly 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.269
 piston deteriorates if used 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.560
 this filter 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.980
 I personally have not found any confirmation 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.650
 these words are purely pure with 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.239
 words i have nothing yet atwood taste everything 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.840
 ok i don't think everything will be 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.690
 ok thank you all for your attention 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.370
