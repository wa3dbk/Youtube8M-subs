00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.279
 from 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.080
 it was amazing it is really fun on 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.060
 the beginning gives you panic is right 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.280
 and then decelerate the entire turn 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.950
 You are always in the way of getting involved 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.950
 so also wants to slow down as well 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 actually I was a bit scared 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.460
 because I have a bit of problems 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 we were already in eighth but that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.420
 is no comparison and if you are 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.180
 so four wheels and then behind the lot 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 better yes that was so fast 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.630
 quickly my life is dangerous 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.979
 that has always been my coach 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
 drive fast but here it was 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.360
 completely new experiences just this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 speed that has already experienced and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.220
 also in the curves of this tourist that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 was simply the only doctor confirm 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.730
 questionable fun was the first 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.070
 really scary here is right for 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.820
 Camberg is against such a 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.430
 roller coaster 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.490
 but then I was really fun 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.430
 does not have all the time been a 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 Nice car would not say no 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.780
 so alone the sound and the car 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.910
 lets in that critical time 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.360
 a little goose bumps and when he does this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.400
 dynamism and power simply bursting with joy 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.150
 in front of energy and are still through the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.540
 so good to control road conditions so 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.540
 I am porsche
