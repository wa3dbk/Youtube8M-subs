main<00:01:59.709> setup<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:01.149> I'm<00:02:01.240> set<00:02:01.450> up<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.720> fly<00:02:02.110> for

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
main setup what I'm set up to fly for

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
spectrum servos you know from horizon

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.490 
spectrum servos you know from horizon
and<00:02:08.819> yeah<00:02:09.819> it<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.090> awesome<00:02:10.360> flying<00:02:10.780> helicopter

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
so that's what I'm taking the urge of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.280 
so that's what I'm taking the urge of
this<00:02:32.500> year<00:02:33.120> feels<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.239> every<00:02:34.540> year<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
this year feels like every year the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.400 
this year feels like every year the
light<00:02:35.500> gets<00:02:35.850> lessen<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.450> load<00:02:37.630> gets<00:02:37.810> lighter

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
light gets lessen the load gets lighter

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.009 
light gets lessen the load gets lighter
and<00:02:38.709> less<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.190> less<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.930> definitely<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
and less and less but definitely the

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.460 
and less and less but definitely the
quality<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.530> helicopters<00:02:42.310> go<00:02:42.459> up<00:02:43.200> our<00:02:44.200> last

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
quality of helicopters go up our last
