00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
which is called the four gravity boots

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
which is called the four gravity boots
and<00:00:10.380> your<00:00:10.800> wear<00:00:11.040> them<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.400> all<00:00:11.460> look<00:00:11.580> like

this is activated you will jump and
depending<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.769> where<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.189> block<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> facing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
depending on where the block is facing

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.959 
depending on where the block is facing
you<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.080> hover<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.579> will<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.700> start

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you can hover so you will just start

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.600 
you can hover so you will just start
hovering<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.110> hold<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:35.309> boots

here or are wearing them you were will

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.220 
here or are wearing them you were will
go<00:00:38.340> back<00:00:38.520> down<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.930> hold<00:00:40.050> in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
go back down so if we if we just hold in
your<00:00:40.260> blog<00:00:40.559> we'll<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:41.010> start<00:00:41.219> floating

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
your blog we'll just start floating

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.540 
your blog we'll just start floating
upwards<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> vangie<00:00:43.980> holder<00:00:44.219> boots<00:00:44.370> you'll

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
upwards and vangie holder boots you'll

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.510 
upwards and vangie holder boots you'll
go<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:44.760> down<00:00:45.260> next<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.129> same<00:00:47.280> block

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
go back down next this is the same block

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.569 
go back down next this is the same block
but<00:00:47.730> it'll<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.270> directions<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.829> let's

one does which is the gas this will be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.490 
one does which is the gas this will be
the<00:02:07.619> directional<00:02:08.810> repulsor<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:10.050> where<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the directional repulsor know where a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.300 
the directional repulsor know where a
tractor<00:02:11.009> pull<00:02:12.000> yeah<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> tractor<00:02:12.690> so

let go over boots and will push you
towards<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.310> let's<00:02:20.150> say<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.390> cross<00:02:20.840> into<00:02:20.989> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
towards it so let's say we cross into it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.839 
towards it so let's say we cross into it
line<00:02:21.380> he'll<00:02:21.650> start<00:02:21.920> dragging<00:02:22.370> me<00:02:22.430> towards<00:02:22.550> it

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
line he'll start dragging me towards it

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.520 
line he'll start dragging me towards it
we're<00:02:23.270> closer<00:02:23.480> we<00:02:23.660> get<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.840> faster<00:02:24.349> you'll

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
is just basic visa the same blocks the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.400 
is just basic visa the same blocks the
same<00:02:34.130> as<00:02:34.849> these<00:02:35.060> only<00:02:35.630> builder<00:02:36.140> every

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
same as these only builder every

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.770 
same as these only builder every
direction<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.190> with<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> ripples<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:38.150> mean<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
direction so with the ripples I mean the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.509 
direction so with the ripples I mean the
attractor<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.680> will<00:02:39.800> attract<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.400> no

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
attractor you will attract to it no

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.360 
attractor you will attract to it no
matter<00:02:40.640> where<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:40.940> are<00:02:41.410> oops<00:02:42.410> kind<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.220> hard

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
matter where you are oops kind of hard

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.729 
matter where you are oops kind of hard
to<00:02:43.430> boot<00:02:43.610> again<00:02:43.940> yep<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.080> we're<00:02:45.350> all<00:02:45.500> tracked

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
to boot again yep so we're all tracked

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.550 
to boot again yep so we're all tracked
any<00:02:45.890> mob<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.910> then<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.209> balsa<00:02:47.630> go<00:02:48.170> push<00:02:48.380> them

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
any mob and then we balsa go push them

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.410 
any mob and then we balsa go push them
away<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:49.220> will<00:02:49.310> keep<00:02:49.430> those<00:02:49.580> spiders<00:02:50.330> or

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
away that will keep those spiders or

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.479 
away that will keep those spiders or
white<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.319> see<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.620> pushing<00:02:51.950> me<00:02:52.040> away<00:02:52.130> I

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
it will be online ingots in separate

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160 
it will be online ingots in separate
corners<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.019> compass<00:03:45.019> in<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
corners just like that compass in the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.050 
corners just like that compass in the
middle<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.530> there's<00:03:45.799> some<00:03:46.040> redstone<00:03:46.310> just

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
middle and there's some redstone just

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.000 
middle and there's some redstone just
underneath<00:03:47.420> ax<00:03:47.690> okay<00:03:48.500> cool<00:03:48.680> you've<00:03:48.859> got<00:03:48.980> a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
underneath ax okay cool you've got a

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.580 
underneath ax okay cool you've got a
gravitas<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:50.870> course<00:03:51.109> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.319> activate

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
gravitas and of course you can activate

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.539 
gravitas and of course you can activate
this<00:03:51.739> it<00:03:52.220> will<00:03:52.370> kind<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.180> push<00:03:54.280> Santa<00:03:55.280> make<00:03:55.400> you

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
this it will kind of push Santa make you

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.340 
this it will kind of push Santa make you
float<00:03:55.790> away<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.329> stuff<00:03:56.480> which<00:03:57.019> is<00:03:57.170> really

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
float away and stuff which is really

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.479 
float away and stuff which is really
cool<00:03:58.120> next<00:03:59.120> would<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.489> directional

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
cool next would be the directional

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.970 
cool next would be the directional
gravitate<00:04:02.030> or<00:04:02.380> think<00:04:03.380> I'm<00:04:03.470> saying<00:04:03.680> upright

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
gravitate or think I'm saying upright

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.830 
gravitate or think I'm saying upright
and<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.940> one's<00:04:05.120> really<00:04:05.299> simple<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.720> just

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
and this one's really simple you just

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.440 
and this one's really simple you just
need<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.290> Nick<00:04:06.560> notes<00:04:07.030> right<00:04:08.030> there<00:04:08.239> you

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
need to I Nick notes right there you

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.970 
need to I Nick notes right there you
need<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> redstone<00:04:09.079> in<00:04:09.350> between<00:04:09.620> that<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:09.889> you

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
need a redstone in between that and you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.210 
need a redstone in between that and you
need<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.160> compass<00:04:10.760> above<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.170> Sehwa<00:04:12.170> so<00:04:13.130> you

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
need a compass above that Sehwa so you

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.700 
need a compass above that Sehwa so you
can<00:04:13.340> kind<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.639> aim<00:04:14.030> where<00:04:14.299> you're<00:04:14.420> going<00:04:14.600> to

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
can kind of aim where you're going to

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.310 
can kind of aim where you're going to
kind<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.130> shift<00:04:16.400> gravity<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:16.880> suppose<00:04:17.240> so<00:04:18.020> where

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
kind of shift gravity I suppose so where

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.990 
kind of shift gravity I suppose so where
if<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.650> put<00:04:18.800> it<00:04:18.890> there<00:04:19.040> I'll<00:04:19.280> start<00:04:19.640> kind<00:04:19.910> of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
if you put it there I'll start kind of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.660 
if you put it there I'll start kind of
floating<00:04:20.450> this<00:04:20.660> way<00:04:21.070> so<00:04:22.070> that's<00:04:22.190> on<00:04:22.400> down<00:04:22.640> a

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
floating this way so that's on down a

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.100 
floating this way so that's on down a
bit<00:04:23.200> okay<00:04:24.280> next<00:04:25.280> would<00:04:25.640> be<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:26.270> attractor<00:04:26.900> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
bit okay next would be the attractor and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.260 
bit okay next would be the attractor and
it's<00:04:27.980> kind<00:04:28.460> of<00:04:28.490> like<00:04:28.610> League<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.820> one<00:04:28.970> so<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
it's kind of like League of one so you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.870 
it's kind of like League of one so you
need<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.810> nig<00:04:30.050> notes<00:04:30.260> in<00:04:30.410> each<00:04:30.530> corner<00:04:30.880> like

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
need for I nig notes in each corner like

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.510 
need for I nig notes in each corner like
so<00:04:32.060> you'll<00:04:32.630> need<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.960> redstone<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.100> kind<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.460> a

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
so you'll need a redstone and kind of a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.810 
so you'll need a redstone and kind of a
cross<00:04:34.760> like<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.890> want<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.400> compass

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
cross like this and you want a compass

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.420 
cross like this and you want a compass
in<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.150> middle<00:04:38.420> they<00:04:39.140> are<00:04:39.320> oops<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.190> yeah

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
in the middle they are oops so yeah

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.520 
in the middle they are oops so yeah
you've<00:04:40.580> got<00:04:40.610> me<00:04:40.790> a<00:04:40.820> tractor<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.540> I've<00:04:42.260> got

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
you've got me a tractor and I've got

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.000 
you've got me a tractor and I've got
turned<00:04:42.740> on<00:04:42.830> my<00:04:42.980> sound<00:04:43.220> sorry<00:04:44.080> so<00:04:45.080> yep<00:04:45.800> you'll

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
turned on my sound sorry so yep you'll

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.290 
turned on my sound sorry so yep you'll
make<00:04:46.160> via<00:04:46.280> tractor<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:46.970> want<00:04:47.150> two<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
make via tractor and you want two of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.150 
make via tractor and you want two of
these<00:04:47.420> if<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> want<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.050> make<00:04:48.170> gravity<00:04:49.040> boots

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
these if you want to make gravity boots

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.150 
these if you want to make gravity boots
and<00:04:49.520> then<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.930> directional<00:04:51.710> attractor<00:04:52.130> is

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
and then the directional attractor is

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.720 
and then the directional attractor is
next<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.700> it's<00:04:53.090> likely<00:04:53.240> over<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:54.140> were<00:04:54.730> need

either<00:05:39.380> side<00:05:39.620> are<00:05:39.830> they<00:05:40.400> are<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.670> got<00:05:40.790> a

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
either side are they are you got a

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.990 
either side are they are you got a
directional<00:05:41.360> repulsor<00:05:41.810> place<00:05:42.560> out<00:05:42.710> that<00:05:43.000> and

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
directional repulsor place out that and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.480 
directional repulsor place out that and
then<00:05:44.360> last<00:05:45.200> I<00:05:45.470> believe<00:05:45.530> will<00:05:45.920> be<00:05:45.950> the<00:05:46.040> gravity

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
then last I believe will be the gravity

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.610 
then last I believe will be the gravity
boots<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:47.060> what<00:05:47.990> you<00:05:48.050> need<00:05:48.200> for<00:05:48.350> this<00:05:48.470> you

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
boots and what you need for this you

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.130 
boots and what you need for this you
need<00:05:48.770> two<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.010> these<00:05:49.220> two<00:05:49.700> attractors<00:05:50.270> on<00:05:50.480> Eva

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
need two of these two attractors on Eva

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.050 
need two of these two attractors on Eva
con<00:05:51.380> like<00:05:51.740> so<00:05:51.980> and<00:05:52.460> all<00:05:52.640> you<00:05:52.730> need<00:05:52.880> to<00:05:52.970> do

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
con like so and all you need to do

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.450 
con like so and all you need to do
really<00:05:53.390> simple<00:05:53.780> to<00:05:53.810> place<00:05:54.170> to<00:05:54.530> our<00:05:54.710> one<00:05:55.160> iron

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
really simple to place to our one iron

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.490 
really simple to place to our one iron
above<00:05:55.880> them<00:05:56.060> they<00:05:56.630> are<00:05:56.660> he'll<00:05:56.960> get<00:05:57.140> gravity

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
above them they are he'll get gravity

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.850 
above them they are he'll get gravity
boots<00:05:57.620> so<00:05:58.190> if<00:05:58.520> you're<00:05:59.120> being<00:05:59.260> pushed<00:06:00.260> back<00:06:00.500> and

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
boots so if you're being pushed back and

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.520 
boots so if you're being pushed back and
you<00:06:01.040> oops<00:06:01.700> sorry<00:06:02.000> I'm<00:06:02.960> wearing<00:06:03.260> them<00:06:03.350> that's

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
you oops sorry I'm wearing them that's

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.950 
you oops sorry I'm wearing them that's
why<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.370> where<00:06:04.670> if<00:06:05.240> you<00:06:05.360> get<00:06:05.510> in<00:06:05.600> push<00:06:05.750> back

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
why so where if you get in push back

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.420 
why so where if you get in push back
you're<00:06:06.140> trying<00:06:06.290> to<00:06:06.380> reach<00:06:06.740> a<00:06:06.890> certain<00:06:07.040> area

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
you're trying to reach a certain area

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.190 
you're trying to reach a certain area
and<00:06:07.640> you<00:06:07.700> get<00:06:07.820> in<00:06:07.910> push<00:06:08.060> back<00:06:08.270> it'll<00:06:08.720> hold<00:06:08.960> them

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
and you get in push back it'll hold them

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.630 
and you get in push back it'll hold them
or<00:06:09.350> your<00:06:09.500> weatherman<00:06:09.920> it<00:06:10.160> will<00:06:10.250> stop<00:06:10.430> any

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
or your weatherman it will stop any

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.060 
or your weatherman it will stop any
