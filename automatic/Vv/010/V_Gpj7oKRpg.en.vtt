00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.929
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 short video of me 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 Apple has one at 7 o'clock today 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.410
 new ios 7.1 peter this time the third 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 published and there are some 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 innovations that I like to show you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.060
 this time on my ipad 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 all things really only on the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.390
 iphone I will be new to you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.489
 Show pr pictures as i have my iphone 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.500
 continue to use for jake videos 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 I do not want to update 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 the jailbreak is not yet with the third 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 beta works in the description 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 The new beta is that much of the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 performance has been worked out and others 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 bugfixes were performed and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.070
 otherwise apple gives hardly any changes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.110
 I would like to praise you anyway 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.570
 course now in this video to go 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.040
 First of all, here in the notes 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.470
 app because i want to give you the keyboard 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.489
 Show this has a few small ones 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.170
 renewals received 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.469
 Now you have a white one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.420
 background at the delete key as well 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.950
 as with the two shift buttons on the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 respective pages and me there 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.479
 click on it will be white 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.370
 background next to it gray and then 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.260
 Let's write big and I have to 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.060
 frankly not get used because 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.940
 I somehow find that this white he 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.920
 but writing is great 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.720
 then just a habituation thing 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 looks pretty good on watch 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 every case in this bad os 7 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.760
 design 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.159
 another innovation is in 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.750
 the settings under backgrounds and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.580
 brightness if I mean mine now 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 Background image I would like to select 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.700
 I left the opportunity here 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.310
 abort what is rather irrelevant 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 then here is the whole in the lock screen 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.220
 and here we have it now 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.500
 a new point, namely movement 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 that looks a little bit on the iphone 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.710
 Nicer but we have here now 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.799
 just the possibility of the complete picture 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.689
 You also see that changes 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.159
 here then picture and then appear 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.180
 no movement then becomes too 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.790
 example in lockscreen not 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.409
 isolated 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.049
 imessage facetime and the photos app 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 were a little adapted to this 17 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.020
 a little grayer and are not anymore 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.159
 so bright 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.159
 I'll just give you a few 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.060
 photos one of the company phone app 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.860
 from the iphone 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.340
 because there is now a round 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.530
 call or 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.940
 the button and generally we have there 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.500
 a new design and I'll show you 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.950
 now simply by pictures 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.110
 just shown in the video one 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.750
 Another innovation that quickly into the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.010
 Eye sticks as soon as you get that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.780
 we will see here now if I exhibit 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 Hold down the power button 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 namely now a new window to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.569
 off Who me once a round 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.980
 Cancel button below and then see 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.480
 we up here that we have one 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.549
 Unfortunately have off and that is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.099
 This time also round and we have 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.160
 here a completely new design continues 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.650
 the whole thing is very transparent here though 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.849
 Overall, that really looks very nice 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 I like it and definitely 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.349
 better than the previous design 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.130
 further innovations are currently still 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.840
 not known 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 the you are welcome as far as you that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.099
 know and write in the comments 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.870
 and I'll get you down in there again 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.360
 the video description will be so misplace 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.640
 far next to it more have come out 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.310
 Apple also has the icloud 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.019
 and imessage fixed some problems 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.730
 because there were only three matches problems 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.650
 the message has not been lowered 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.200
 are and should be in the third beta 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.609
 have been corrected 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.049
 that was it again from this one 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.880
 video I hope you liked it 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.940
 I hope you have this short overview 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.950
 brought to the latest ios 4.1 beta something 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.049
 if so, if you then for the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.250
 fourth beta if one should appear 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.870
 also wants to see a video 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.220
 give this double one thumb 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.840
 above you can like me the comments 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.269
