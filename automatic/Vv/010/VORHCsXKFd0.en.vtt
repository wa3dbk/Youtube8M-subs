00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:40.780
 any supermarket 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.369
 Well, let's go first breakfast is the most 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.350
 the usual shade with fruit us 

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:46.330
 you need the oatmeal itself 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.850
 banana and strawberry or any other berries 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.140
 milk and honey I remember that in childhood this 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.750
 porridge made me want one thing 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.580

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.229

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.640
 cook super tasty if the icon 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.489
 pour boiling water over porridge and put it on 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.100
 slow fire and for now we cook the porridge 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.970
 cut the fruit strawberries can shred 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
 even buckets 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.860
 but the banana enough halves all the same 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.390
 this thing is pretty coloring I know what 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.400
 many cook porridge with milk 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.890
 I boil on water and add milk myself 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 end and quite a bit of taste is obtained 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 the same creamy and less calories 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.719
 we lay our fruit on top and 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.060
 we pour the whole thing 1 spoon of honey 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.679
 no need to plunk a ton of oil in porridge 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 need to sprinkle it with sugar and so 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.799
 It turns out very tasty slavka useful 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.659
 the second breakfast is a favorite omelet 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.920
 but which we will improve and make 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.560
 safe for our figure 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.420
 we need eggs Bulgarian milk 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.829
 pepper tomatoes green onions low-fat cheese 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.200
 as well as salt and spices 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.429
 we also need a nice griddle 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.509
 with non-stick coating 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.250
 I will use this one 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.520
 ceramic and yet our pan 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.270
 warmed up we will cut the vegetables 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.670
 reminds and what we will not add 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.049
 no butter vegetables and so will 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.989
 high enough our no not 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.160
 burned 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:11.590
 break eggs very carefully 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.900
 any capacity why because 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 two tough of three will go to heaven and immediately 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 trash can add some water 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.359

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.889
 low-fat harsh this is very tasty so far 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.340
 filmed this video safely 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.680
 ripped the lid off the pan 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 yes in terms of homework hands not from 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.489
 Asses now left sprinkle on Shandrik 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.709
 onions and can be served 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.019
 I really like the look of this 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.470
 omelette because it reminds me of pizza 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.269
 for the pizza guys i can suffer souls and 3 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.370
 breakfast for those who, like me, do not think 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.980
 my life without sweets i would call it 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.840
 cottage cheese casserole we need 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.269
 picking green apple or 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.390
 than protein cinnamon and ethical jam or 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.819
 fresh berries set temperature in 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.629
 oven somewhere 180 degrees and take 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.629
 grated apple 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.550
 the usual way we have separated the protein 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.840
 from the yolk 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.400
 the city is better to take soft because with 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.970
 it turns out the consistency like 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.970
 cheesecake 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.970
 again cut strawberries 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.860
 I decided to add another season to sweet cherries 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.150
 and begin to lay out the whole thing here 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.549
 such layers in a baking dish 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:33.959
 Now in the oven for 20-30 minutes, watch 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:38.220
 so as not to burn I decided for beauty 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.260
 still cut or voila I love very much 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.420
 cheesecakes but when I lost weight I imagine them 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.500
 almost did not let on and I was just 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.940
 great alternative 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.370
 you can add diet 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.629
 dzhen place fruits but to be honest with 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.790
 fruits are even tastier 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.590
 Well, that seems to be all if you 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.030

 I guess I'll go eat this casserole that 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.720

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.150

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.150
