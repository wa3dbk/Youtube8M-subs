quite<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.060> years<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
quite like this and all my years of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.210 
quite like this and all my years of
doing<00:00:21.539> tree<00:00:21.990> work<00:00:22.400> I've<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:24.080> tree<00:00:25.220> this

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
doing tree work I've got a tree this

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.519 
doing tree work I've got a tree this
hook<00:00:26.820> over<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.570> big<00:00:27.810> Valley<00:00:28.050> Oak<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hook over here this big Valley Oak that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.700 
hook over here this big Valley Oak that
has<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> limb<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.789> goes<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> way<00:00:30.810> up<00:00:31.019> way

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
has a limb it goes all the way up way

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
has a limb it goes all the way up way
out<00:00:31.740> over<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
out over here and this is actually a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
out over here and this is actually a
follow-up<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> video<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.190> did<00:00:35.460> about<00:00:35.489> two

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
follow-up to a video I did about two

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.950 
follow-up to a video I did about two
months<00:00:36.480> ago<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.500> Monterey<00:00:37.920> pine<00:00:38.660> has<00:00:39.660> died

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
months ago this Monterey pine has died

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190 
months ago this Monterey pine has died
and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.649> had<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.890> cut<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.219> down<00:00:41.399> but<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and I had to cut it down but what I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.520 
and I had to cut it down but what I
found<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.149> Monterey<00:00:45.600> pine<00:00:45.960> branch

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
found was that the Monterey pine branch

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.069 
found was that the Monterey pine branch
that's<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> back<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.719> actually

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that's going out on the back is actually

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
that's going out on the back is actually
resting<00:00:50.329> this<00:00:51.329> branch<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:54.180> pine<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
resting this branch and the pine is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.420 
resting this branch and the pine is
supporting<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.660> here's<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.809> dilemma<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.530> got

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
supporting so here's my dilemma I got

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.790 
supporting so here's my dilemma I got
this<00:00:59.579> dead<00:00:59.820> pine<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:01.020> eventually<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.649> going

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this dead pine that eventually is going

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.149 
this dead pine that eventually is going
to<00:01:01.859> become<00:01:02.129> riddled<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.489> bugs<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
to become riddled with bugs and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.960 
to become riddled with bugs and
eventually<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> fall<00:01:06.030> apart<00:01:06.060> but

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
eventually it's going to fall apart but

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.170 
eventually it's going to fall apart but
for<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> duration<00:01:10.369> until<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.090> an

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
for the duration until we put an

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
for the duration until we put an
artificial<00:01:12.479> prop<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.560> supporting

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
artificial prop in here it's supporting

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.130 
artificial prop in here it's supporting
this<00:01:15.119> whole<00:01:15.360> limb<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.430> tree<00:01:17.670> over<00:01:17.700> here

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
this whole limb and this tree over here

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.149 
this whole limb and this tree over here
it<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> failure

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it had a failure

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.050 
it had a failure
years<00:01:20.460> ago<00:01:20.930> over<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.430> I'm

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
years ago over on this side and I'm

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.950 
years ago over on this side and I'm
afraid<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.380> take<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:27.360> support

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
afraid that if we take this support

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.190 
afraid that if we take this support
structure<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
structure out of here

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
structure out of here
okay<00:01:31.200> another<00:01:32.009> failure<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.520> we'll<00:01:32.640> lose<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
okay another failure so we'll lose that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
okay another failure so we'll lose that
whole<00:01:33.180> limb<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> temporary

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
whole limb so I know it's a temporary

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.289 
whole limb so I know it's a temporary
thing<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.159> may<00:01:38.310> linger<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.729> few<00:01:39.000> years

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
thing I know it may linger a few years

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.260 
thing I know it may linger a few years
I'm<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> wondering<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.430> should<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I'm kind of wondering if I should get a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.410 
I'm kind of wondering if I should get a
chainsaw<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:43.610> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> trim<00:01:44.880> away<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
chainsaw out kind of trim away some of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
chainsaw out kind of trim away some of
the<00:01:45.509> bark<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.920> look<00:01:47.100> close<00:01:47.509> kind<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the bark here you look close kind of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.480 
the bark here you look close kind of
hard<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.649> riddled

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
hard to see but you see it's riddled

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.520 
hard to see but you see it's riddled
with<00:01:50.549> bores<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:51.630> full<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.170> insect

sawdust the brass the insects here with
a<00:02:02.470> chainsaw<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:03.370> kind<00:02:03.550> of<00:02:03.640> carved<00:02:04.630> away<00:02:04.750> all

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
a chainsaw just kind of carved away all

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.620 
a chainsaw just kind of carved away all
the<00:02:05.170> park<00:02:05.410> we<00:02:06.010> got<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.310> down<00:02:06.430> to<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.760> ground

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
the park we got it down to the ground

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.650 
the park we got it down to the ground
maybe<00:02:08.020> dug<00:02:08.470> away<00:02:08.710> some<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.190> dirt<00:02:09.660> maybe

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
maybe dug away some of the dirt maybe

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.000 
maybe dug away some of the dirt maybe
put<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:10.990> little<00:02:11.080> bit<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.530> some<00:02:11.710> sort<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
put a little bit of some sort of a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.820 
put a little bit of some sort of a
little<00:02:12.100> wood<00:02:12.340> preservative<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.150> here<00:02:13.830> wonder

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
little wood preservative on here wonder

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.300 
little wood preservative on here wonder
if<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.010> could<00:02:15.070> prolong<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:16.090> eventual<00:02:17.280> decay<00:02:18.280> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
if I could prolong the eventual decay of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.870 
if I could prolong the eventual decay of
this<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.390> prop<00:02:19.750> could<00:02:20.590> actually

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
this so that this prop could actually

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.420 
this so that this prop could actually
stay<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> little<00:02:22.120> bit<00:02:22.270> longer<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:24.100> worth<00:02:24.280> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
stay a little bit longer it's worth the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.850 
stay a little bit longer it's worth the
effort

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.740 

and<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.310> see<00:02:28.550> we've<00:02:28.760> got<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.060> sort<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> tied

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and you see we've got it sort of tied

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.670 
and you see we've got it sort of tied
together<00:02:29.990> up<00:02:30.380> there<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.510> know<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.350> just

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
together up there but I know it's just

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.450 
together up there but I know it's just
one<00:02:33.860> branch<00:02:34.390> but<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:36.260> constitutes<00:02:36.920> half<00:02:37.250> of

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
one branch but it constitutes half of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.630 
one branch but it constitutes half of
the<00:02:37.610> entire<00:02:37.910> tree<00:02:38.360> there<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.280> client

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
the entire tree there and the client

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.070 
the entire tree there and the client
doesn't<00:02:40.820> want<00:02:40.970> to<00:02:41.180> lose<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.650> branch<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
doesn't want to lose the branch so it is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.190 
doesn't want to lose the branch so it is
what<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.350> is<00:02:47.590> it's<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.650> bit<00:02:48.770> different
