00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:09.129
 The first installment has fired Hisashi Abe production increase ROPEWORK 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.129
 Because there was a demand 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 First of all 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.080
 Ribbon s beauty in a general tie 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.510
 It falls loose when you talk 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.260
 Why does this play a lot 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.700
 It will be 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.700
 To avoid this 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.680
 through 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.590
 here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.590
 can enter 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.590
 I squeeze out here 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.340
 There is a follow-up or it's against the opposite 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 It's hard and it's fixed here and it doesn't move anymore 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.040
 This is two 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.170
 That 2 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.470
 Ami-to-net, or a tie used to connect a net-to-wire 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.010
 It is important to have you remember this first 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.130
 To stop this 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.720
 This will be a voice day but this is enough 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.620
 If it is a cool guy 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.620
 Make a tooth 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.080
 2 rotations 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.220
 In that case , make it so that there is no play here 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.170
 4 rotation What rotation is also good I further returns this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.010
 Yes put in here of teeth 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 I can not take this anymore 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.290
 This is a very strong tie 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.790
 Let's talk about it when I solve it 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.050
 Wind that this is generally not solved 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.260
 It is a tie used when thinking 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:57.950
 If you want more strength if you want more collaboration than it looks 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.310
 I think that it is enough here to make Suwa 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 Once 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.250
 Oops ball 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:11.620
 If I can not take this Shiho- chan , I will do this 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.980
 How to tie a common core and wire with this 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.510
 Hmm 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.500
 And now I 'm up as the first bullet this time 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.180
 Many other things 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 Lop I already have a great deal 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.400
 It is a tie that can be taken like this 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:34.880
 I think this is a lot to know 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:40.280
 Create a tooth This is Nde it always be focused on what the wind 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.850
 I would also like to explain the core short, so I would like to explain Miki as it is now 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.850
 Please
