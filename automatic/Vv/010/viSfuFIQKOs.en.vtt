00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello and welcome to the Jewish kitchen 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.680
 Sephardic today I'm going to you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.750
 show how to do natal debate so 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.980
 this is simply and ben attash 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.650
 mellow wish this project a 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 second ready to taste 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.130
 so I 'm laughing a couple of dozen 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.220
 firefighters earth with the skin is 3rd 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 for half an hour over low heat and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 half covered and I will need for 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.930
 seasoning pepper salt and 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 jute he plays so that's after a half 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.290
 cooking time 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 I pour the hot water and I fill 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.520
 of cold water and gestures like that during 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.050
 5 to 10 minutes five minutes are spent 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 and I repeat the operation so I 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 pour hot hours in once and I 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.379
 filled with cold water level for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.379
 can the grocers feel the burned 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.960
 so now here I take a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.680
 potato and I'm going fishing 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.720
 quietly all 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.090
 so that's it more easily 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.580
 and I want to do the same so for 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.320
 all the potatoes of 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.260
 potatoes were peeled good 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 now we are going salty we must have it 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.500
 is because potatoes in 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:42.700
 tend to be a bit sweet when they 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:45.000
 have been boiled pepper and a good bit of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.000
 lemon juice 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 here and now we will start there 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.960
 dig with the mashed press 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.130
 so here we are doing potatoes have 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.080
 well been crushed now will add 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.140
 the waters so it's very easy or 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.229
 take a hard-boiled egg in half 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.770
 then again in two and there we will cut 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.770
 small pieces 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.689
 so I add had three hours in 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:24.060
 all well I'm going to mix by hand 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:27.629
 so correct the seasoning to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:34.799
 needs have been revised by hand to 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:37.069
 not crush all the eyes in fact one 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.359
 can add tuna of aliant dachier 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.870
 to add what you want in fact 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.870
 finally the page bana 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.770
 so that's after we take a little bit of 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.290
 stuffing and we are a little in the hands in 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.460
 doing the form of the hype and finally 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.460
 like that for the whole face 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 the set of age bibs were 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.530
 distorted so here I prepared a 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.760
 plate with flour and our 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.900
 plate with a work I 'm going 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:23.930
 beat while we're doing and of course I 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.989
 put on the cloud so a frying pan 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.520
 with oil is also a plateau 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.440
 with absorbent paper 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.239
 So we proceed to the breading 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.290
 markings rolled into the flour 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.290
 then just put in the egg 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:53.780
 and we put it gently we do that 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.819
 will be able to go back quickly 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.120
 the rides because actually apples 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.370
 earthen 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.370
 all in all is cooked inside so 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.430
 it remains more than the main ones 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.280
 business stopped so loved this 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.909
 man is very fast then it takes 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:19.160
 do a little quick a good here we 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:21.099
 go back and it would be fast it was on 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.539
 fairly bright fire 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:29.360
 why do the potatoes do 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:31.840
 part in here we are going to come to the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 country 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:48.350
 and we're going to come and shoot others like 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.530
 I made you a rap you must add 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.870
 foot in the door 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.740
 we can put more fertile or quad 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.740
 board is in love
