00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.920
 after opening the windows explorer you 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.360
 You may notice that by default already 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.000
 created four libraries this 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.549
 library image blogger 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.259
 documents books music 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.709
 pound as we said 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.550
 the advantage of home libraries is that they 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.579
 may contain enrolled from different 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.070
 places 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.420
 an example shows that my library 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.020
 drawings by the way this post in may republic 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.589
 and dad common of images 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.839
 to add new libraries 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.619
 shake the right mouse button 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.659
 empty place 

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.469
 library folders and in the menu that opens 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.500
 select create 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.890
 you can easily add to the library 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.480
 and other parties wherever they are 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.220
 even if they are located on 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.470
 removable media or external hard drive 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.240
 in order to do that 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.280
 open any in libraries and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 right click on 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.040
 empty space inside the window 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.320
 appear in the list, select 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 properties 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.630
 Now in the window that opens, click on 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.350
 add button in mince 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.799
 and in response to the employee add the one you need 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 steam 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810
 this library 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 in the same window you can change dad 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.460
 which will be stored in memory 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.320
 moved to this library 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.170
 for this in the library folder list 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170
 right click on 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.050
 the desired folder and select the task 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.600
 as location for 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 save to the troupe of silence 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.010
 and here you can optimize 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.050
 this library for different types 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.550
 of files 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.990
 Several options are available such as 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.140
 image documents video 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.120
 music common elements optimization under 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.040
 each specific file type does not allow 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.110
 only optimize 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.890
 content display but also adds to 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.590
 unique opportunities 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.530
 sorting 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 For example, choose the type of sorting 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.650
 libraries and videos 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.300
 as you can see you can select the sort by 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.960
 duration and video 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.090
 this is one of the bullets not Kalina 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.840
 opportunities for this type 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.879
 libraries
