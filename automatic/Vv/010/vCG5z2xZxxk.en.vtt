the one we have to tweak right first
person<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.969> aiming<00:01:03.480> sensitivity<00:01:04.439> now<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.860> my

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
person that aiming sensitivity now in my

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.750 
person that aiming sensitivity now in my
opinion<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> little<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.210> high<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:07.619> find<00:01:08.610> if

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
opinion it's a little bit high I find if

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.700 
opinion it's a little bit high I find if
I<00:01:08.880> turn<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.510> couple<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.930> notches<00:01:10.110> maybe

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
I turn it down a couple of notches maybe

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640 
I turn it down a couple of notches maybe
there<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.340> find<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:13.500> control

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there I find that I have more control

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.460 
there I find that I have more control
over<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.460> aiming<00:01:15.180> other<00:01:15.689> than<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.259> pretty

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.109 
the r32 look down the scope okay that's
another<00:02:08.069> thing<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.640> remember<00:02:08.959> right

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
another thing to remember right

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.559 
another thing to remember right

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.660 
and yeah then we can also push l3 to
crouch<00:02:13.930> which<00:02:14.709> will<00:02:14.890> give<00:02:15.069> us<00:02:15.159> even<00:02:15.400> more

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
crouch which will give us even more

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.119 
crouch which will give us even more
