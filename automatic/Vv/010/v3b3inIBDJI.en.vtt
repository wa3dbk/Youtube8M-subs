Skarmory<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> cool<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.460> really

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
Skarmory is cool but I really really

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.030 
Skarmory is cool but I really really
really<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:34.079> squirmy<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> get

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
really really really want squirmy to get

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
really really really want squirmy to get
an<00:01:35.130> evolution<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> pre<00:01:36.570> evolution<00:01:37.079> because

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
an evolution not a pre evolution because

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
an evolution not a pre evolution because
pre<00:01:37.560> evolutions<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.280> opinion<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> cheap

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
pre evolutions in my opinion are a cheap

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.929 
pre evolutions in my opinion are a cheap
cop-out<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:41.040> just

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
cop-out I think that's really it just

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.520 
cop-out I think that's really it just
doesn't<00:01:42.360> make<00:01:42.450> sense<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.810> me<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
doesn't make sense to me how is it that

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560 
doesn't make sense to me how is it that
you<00:01:43.740> discovered<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.280> baby<00:01:44.549> Pokemon<00:01:45.119> after<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you discovered a baby Pokemon after you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
you discovered a baby Pokemon after you
already<00:01:45.840> discovered<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> fucking<00:01:46.799> Pokemon

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
already discovered the fucking Pokemon

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.920 
already discovered the fucking Pokemon
you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.970> came<00:01:48.210> first<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> chicken<00:01:48.630> or

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
you know what came first the chicken or

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
you know what came first the chicken or
the<00:01:48.990> egg<00:01:49.200> technically<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> chicken<00:01:50.220> did<00:01:50.399> but

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
the egg technically the chicken did but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.359 
the egg technically the chicken did but
you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.439> you<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> baby<00:01:52.890> Pokemon<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
you know what you need a baby Pokemon to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.620 
you know what you need a baby Pokemon to
get<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> fulcrum<00:01:53.820> Pokemon<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.299> eventually

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
get a fulcrum Pokemon so eventually

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.850 
get a fulcrum Pokemon so eventually
should<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.869> found<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> baby<00:01:55.229> Pokemon<00:01:55.590> okay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
should have found the baby Pokemon okay

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.170 
should have found the baby Pokemon okay
it's<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.490> any<00:01:56.640> sense<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> me

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's just like make any sense to me

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.850 
it's just like make any sense to me
but<00:01:57.329> anyway<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.810> hope<00:01:58.049> Skarmory<00:01:58.560> gets<00:01:58.740> an

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
but anyway I hope Skarmory gets an

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
but anyway I hope Skarmory gets an
evolution<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.909> why<00:02:00.030> he's<00:02:00.149> number<00:02:00.240> 5

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
evolution and that's why he's number 5

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.719 
evolution and that's why he's number 5
