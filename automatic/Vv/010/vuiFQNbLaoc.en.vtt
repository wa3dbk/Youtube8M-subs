00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
some noob tube footage as well because

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.569 
some noob tube footage as well because
they're<00:03:42.350> aided<00:03:42.769> weapons<00:03:43.130> in<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
they're aided weapons in this and

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.460 
they're aided weapons in this and
rightly<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.269> I<00:03:44.480> mean<00:03:44.840> they're<00:03:44.959> just<00:03:45.139> like<00:03:45.350> I

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
rightly so I mean they're just like I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.110 
rightly so I mean they're just like I
said<00:03:45.709> they're<00:03:45.920> these<00:03:46.340> people<00:03:46.670> are<00:03:46.760> horrible

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
said they're these people are horrible

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.539 
said they're these people are horrible
at<00:03:47.329> balancing<00:03:47.750> weapons<00:03:48.139> I<00:03:48.859> mean<00:03:49.340> look<00:03:49.519> how

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
at balancing weapons I mean look how

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.400 
at balancing weapons I mean look how
close<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:50.030> was<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.750> dude<00:03:50.959> I<00:03:51.170> think

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
close I was to that dude I think

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.379 
close I was to that dude I think
actually<00:03:51.799> shotgun<00:03:52.400> attachments<00:03:53.060> which<00:03:53.180> we're

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
actually shotgun attachments which we're

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.420 
actually shotgun attachments which we're
working<00:03:53.720> on<00:03:53.840> right<00:03:53.870> now<00:03:54.130> probably<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.250> more

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
working on right now probably have more

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.520 
working on right now probably have more
range<00:03:55.700> than<00:03:55.940> these<00:03:56.120> things<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.660> mean<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.500> a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
range than these things I mean this is a

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.789 
range than these things I mean this is a
12-gauge<00:03:58.280> 30<00:03:59.180> inch<00:03:59.389> barrel<00:03:59.780> shotgun<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.620> can

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
12-gauge 30 inch barrel shotgun that can

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.160 
12-gauge 30 inch barrel shotgun that can
usually<00:04:01.190> shoot<00:04:01.549> around<00:04:01.849> 30<00:04:02.209> yards<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.870> think

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
usually shoot around 30 yards I think

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.650 
usually shoot around 30 yards I think
actually<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.530> beam<00:04:03.769> farther<00:04:04.310> than<00:04:04.370> 30<00:04:04.660> but

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
actually you beam farther than 30 but

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.750 
actually you beam farther than 30 but
you<00:04:05.810> can't<00:04:06.049> even<00:04:06.260> drop<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> dude<00:04:06.859> at<00:04:07.069> like<00:04:07.220> 15

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
you can't even drop a dude at like 15

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.849 
you can't even drop a dude at like 15
feet<00:04:08.180> with<00:04:08.389> these<00:04:08.569> things<00:04:08.989> when<00:04:09.590> you're<00:04:09.739> in

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
feet with these things when you're in

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.890 
feet with these things when you're in
game<00:04:10.130> they<00:04:10.579> used<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:11.030> be<00:04:11.120> able<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.359> do<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.630> and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
game they used to be able to do that and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.979 
game they used to be able to do that and
rightly<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.280> now<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.940> mean<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.569> whole

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
rightly so but now I mean the whole

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.360 
rightly so but now I mean the whole
akimbo<00:04:15.319> thing<00:04:15.650> probably<00:04:15.980> sucks<00:04:16.220> balls

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
akimbo thing probably sucks balls

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.949 
akimbo thing probably sucks balls
anymore

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
anymore

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.229 
anymore
it<00:04:17.959> helps<00:04:18.229> extend<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.190> blast<00:04:19.430> that's<00:04:20.030> why

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
it helps extend the the blast that's why

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.050 
it helps extend the the blast that's why
I<00:04:20.299> don't<00:04:20.539> go<00:04:20.900> 1<00:04:21.530> 2<00:04:21.859> 1<00:04:22.130> 2<00:04:22.160> like<00:04:22.580> left<00:04:22.849> right<00:04:23.030> left

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
I don't go 1 2 1 2 like left right left
