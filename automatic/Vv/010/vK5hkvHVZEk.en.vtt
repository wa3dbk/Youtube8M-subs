builds and in this video I'm gonna show

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.000 
builds and in this video I'm gonna show
you<00:00:09.059> 10<00:00:09.450> different<00:00:09.630> techniques<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
you 10 different techniques that can

you 10 different techniques that can
take<00:00:11.219> mediocre<00:00:11.940> builds<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.750> Awesome<00:00:13.320> builds

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
take mediocre builds to Awesome builds

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.369 
take mediocre builds to Awesome builds
now<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.460> very<00:00:14.730> first<00:00:15.030> one<00:00:15.330> should<00:00:16.049> seem

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
now the very first one should seem

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.250 
now the very first one should seem
pretty<00:00:16.680> sensible<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.029> plan<00:00:18.330> ahead<00:00:18.570> take

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
pretty sensible it's to plan ahead take

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.609 
pretty sensible it's to plan ahead take
some<00:00:19.500> time<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.250> plan<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.119> want<00:00:21.390> now<00:00:22.380> here

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
some time to plan what you want now here

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
some time to plan what you want now here
are<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:22.890> good<00:00:23.070> examples<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.699> how<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> do

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
are two good examples of how not to do

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
are two good examples of how not to do
this<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.320> first<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> castle<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
this this first one is a castle that I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.939 
this this first one is a castle that I
built<00:00:27.119> now<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> wanted<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> castle<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.680> thick

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
built now I wanted the castle with thick

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.890 
built now I wanted the castle with thick
walls<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.640> wanted<00:00:29.970> rooms<00:00:30.300> within<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
walls and I wanted rooms within the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
walls and I wanted rooms within the
walls<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.500> thought<00:00:31.650> that'd<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.920> cool<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
walls and I thought that'd be cool and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
walls and I thought that'd be cool and
then<00:00:32.550> an<00:00:32.700> inner<00:00:32.880> courtyard<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.960> would<00:00:34.140> have

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
then an inner courtyard that would have

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.490 
then an inner courtyard that would have
a<00:00:34.320> lot<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.620> Awesomeness<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
a lot of Awesomeness to it and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
a lot of Awesomeness to it and
unfortunately<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> built<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.309> build<00:00:39.120> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
unfortunately when I built it I build it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
unfortunately when I built it I build it
big<00:00:39.480> enough<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.040> instead<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
big enough to do this so instead of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.290 
big enough to do this so instead of
castle<00:00:42.450> epic<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.170> got<00:00:43.530> castle<00:00:44.129> mediocre<00:00:44.879> here's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
castle epic I got castle mediocre here's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.709 
castle epic I got castle mediocre here's
another<00:00:45.570> great<00:00:45.840> example<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.920> art<00:00:47.760> museum<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
another great example this art museum is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510 
another great example this art museum is
supposed<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.410> modeled<00:00:49.800> after<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> Louvre

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
supposed to be modeled after the Louvre

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
supposed to be modeled after the Louvre
but<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.059> decided<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:51.930> multiple

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
but I decided I want to make multiple

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250 
but I decided I want to make multiple
pyramids<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:54.210> different<00:00:54.449> colored<00:00:54.989> glass

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
pyramids and use different colored glass

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.650 
pyramids and use different colored glass
first<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.309> wasn't<00:00:56.610> big<00:00:57.000> enough<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.510> be

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
first of all it wasn't big enough to be

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.439 
first of all it wasn't big enough to be
majestic<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.949> wanted<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.000> then

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
majestic like I wanted it to be and then

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.860 
majestic like I wanted it to be and then
I<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:01.320> didn't<00:01:02.359> think<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
I really didn't think about the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
I really didn't think about the
multicolored<00:01:04.589> glass<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.729> would

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
multicolored glass and how that would

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.840 
multicolored glass and how that would
just<00:01:06.180> kill<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> majestic<00:01:07.530> nature<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.250> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just kill the majestic nature of this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.109 
just kill the majestic nature of this
building<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> had<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> been<00:01:11.400> planning<00:01:11.790> ahead<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
building so had I been planning ahead I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.800 
building so had I been planning ahead I
could<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.630> avoided<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:14.420> next<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
could have avoided all that next one is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.550 
could have avoided all that next one is
to<00:01:15.990> plan<00:01:16.320> big<00:01:16.909> now<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.299> both<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.930> those<00:01:19.049> cases

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to plan big now in both of those cases

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
to plan big now in both of those cases
had<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> built<00:01:20.189> bigger<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.780> would<00:01:21.960> have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
had I built bigger I really would have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
had I built bigger I really would have
had<00:01:22.229> more<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> an<00:01:22.619> opportunity<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> make<00:01:23.970> them

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
had more of an opportunity to make them

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.530 
had more of an opportunity to make them
the<00:01:24.659> way<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.810> wanted<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.759> planning<00:01:27.299> big

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the way I wanted to but by planning big

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
the way I wanted to but by planning big
you'll<00:01:27.990> make<00:01:28.200> sure<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.860> enough<00:01:29.100> real

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you'll make sure you have enough real

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
you'll make sure you have enough real
estate<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.970> build<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.290> enough<00:01:31.860> room<00:01:32.130> for

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
estate to build you have enough room for

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.539 
estate to build you have enough room for
detail<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.750> than<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
detail but more than that you have the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.870 
detail but more than that you have the
wow<00:01:35.970> factor<00:01:36.200> working<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.350> your<00:01:37.530> favor<00:01:37.880> big

wow factor working in your favor big
builds<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.799> things<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> people<00:01:41.549> look

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
builds are the things that people look

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.440

landscaping<00:01:46.259> you'd<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:48.090> your

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
landscaping you'd want to give your

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.289 
landscaping you'd want to give your
builds<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> sense<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> place<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.189> example<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
builds a sense of place for example this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
builds a sense of place for example this
submarine<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.350> submarine<00:01:52.380> could<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.369> be

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
submarine the submarine could just be

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
submarine the submarine could just be
sitting<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> water<00:01:54.360> somewhere<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
sitting in the water somewhere but

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 
sitting in the water somewhere but
instead<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.310> look<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.909> was

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
instead I wanted it to look like it was

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.109 
instead I wanted it to look like it was
docked<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:58.079> remote<00:01:58.799> Bay<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
docked up in some remote Bay up in the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.429 
docked up in some remote Bay up in the
Ukraine<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:02.369> put<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> dock<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
Ukraine and I put the dock there so that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.249 
Ukraine and I put the dock there so that
it<00:02:04.560> had<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.979> place<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.750> made<00:02:07.229> sure

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it had some place to be and I made sure

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.400 
it had some place to be and I made sure
that<00:02:07.710> everything<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.429> close<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.989> really

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
that everything was close and I really

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
that everything was close and I really
ended<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.739> being<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.190> landscaping<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
ended up being the landscaping for the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
ended up being the landscaping for the
submarine

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.250

teleport<00:02:16.920> hub<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> great<00:02:17.610> example<00:02:17.790> look<00:02:18.450> at

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
teleport hub is a great example look at

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.650 
teleport hub is a great example look at
all<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.840> colors<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.350> here<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.860> yet<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.370> works

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
all the colors in here and yet it works

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
all the colors in here and yet it works
think<00:02:21.660> about<00:02:21.960> color<00:02:22.440> rather<00:02:22.800> than<00:02:23.130> just

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
think about color rather than just

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.670 
think about color rather than just
cobblestone<00:02:24.210> think<00:02:24.870> about<00:02:25.140> how<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.380> can

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
cobblestone think about how you can

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.920 
cobblestone think about how you can
integrate<00:02:26.010> color<00:02:26.490> into<00:02:26.910> your<00:02:26.970> builds<00:02:27.450> now<00:02:27.900> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
integrate color into your builds now I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.450 
integrate color into your builds now I
don't<00:02:28.020> mean<00:02:28.260> throwing<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.830> color<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.160> for

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
don't mean throwing in color just for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.430 
don't mean throwing in color just for
the<00:02:29.700> sake<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.000> throwing<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.540> color<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:31.320> I'm

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the sake of throwing in color what I'm

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770 
the sake of throwing in color what I'm
talking<00:02:31.860> about<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.340> putting<00:02:32.820> color<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.540> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
talking about is putting color in that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.560 
talking about is putting color in that
has<00:02:34.350> meaning<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.460> has<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> purpose<00:02:36.300> for<00:02:36.330> being

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
has meaning that has a purpose for being

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.510 
has meaning that has a purpose for being
there<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.500> you're<00:02:37.740> an<00:02:37.860> artist<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.460> you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
there if you're an artist and you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580 
there if you're an artist and you
already<00:02:38.790> understand<00:02:39.420> color<00:02:39.690> well<00:02:40.050> integrate

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
already understand color well integrate

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.530 
already understand color well integrate
that<00:02:40.740> into<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.220> build<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.360> fully

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that into your build if you don't fully

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.720 
that into your build if you don't fully
understand<00:02:43.230> color<00:02:43.500> take<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:43.980> look<00:02:44.220> around<00:02:44.550> you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
understand color take a look around you

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.970 
understand color take a look around you
see<00:02:45.000> what<00:02:45.270> colors<00:02:45.660> match<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.350> what<00:02:46.470> colors<00:02:46.770> go

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
see what colors match and what colors go

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.490 
see what colors match and what colors go
together<00:02:47.040> well<00:02:47.640> same<00:02:48.420> goes<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:48.720> our<00:02:48.990> next<00:02:49.380> one

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
together well same goes for our next one

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.130 
together well same goes for our next one
which<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.770> textures<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.540> put<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.810> lot<00:02:51.960> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
which is textures if you put a lot of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.960 
which is textures if you put a lot of
texture<00:02:52.530> into<00:02:52.650> your<00:02:52.830> builds<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.550> give<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.880> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
texture into your builds you give it a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.570 
texture into your builds you give it a
feeling<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:54.870> touched<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.680> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
feeling that it can be touched and a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.690 
feeling that it can be touched and a
good<00:02:56.850> example<00:02:57.270> is<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.200> another<00:02:58.620> hub<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.100> this

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
good example is this another hub in this

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.940 
good example is this another hub in this
another<00:02:59.940> hub<00:03:00.210> it's<00:03:00.390> all<00:03:00.510> built<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.990> quartz<00:03:01.410> but

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
another hub it's all built of quartz but

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.160 
another hub it's all built of quartz but
yet<00:03:02.160> all<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> quartz<00:03:02.970> has<00:03:03.090> got<00:03:03.300> textures<00:03:03.900> to

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
yet all the quartz has got textures to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.280 
yet all the quartz has got textures to
it<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.430> don't<00:03:05.640> necessarily<00:03:05.850> need<00:03:06.660> colors

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
it so you don't necessarily need colors

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.990 
it so you don't necessarily need colors
if<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.770> look<00:03:07.950> at<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.280> there's<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:08.850> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
if you look at this there's just a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.090 
if you look at this there's just a
splash<00:03:09.270> here<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.800> need<00:03:11.070> that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
splash here and there but you need that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.190 
splash here and there but you need that
texture<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.420> set<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.840> off<00:03:14.210> number<00:03:15.210> six<00:03:15.510> use<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
texture to set it off number six use a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.160 
texture to set it off number six use a
lot<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.860> detail<00:03:17.310> here's<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.270> spleef<00:03:18.660> arena<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
lot of detail here's a spleef arena I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.070 
lot of detail here's a spleef arena I
built<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.310> spleef<00:03:20.670> arena<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.420> ton

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
built and in the spleef arena is a ton

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.920

of detail the more detail you can add to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.260

awesome it becomes next up supporting
structures<00:03:33.540> take<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> look<00:03:34.440> at<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.680> model

railroad<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.910> model<00:03:36.300> railroad<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.810> pretty

railroad this model railroad is pretty

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080 
railroad this model railroad is pretty
cool<00:03:37.290> all<00:03:37.560> by<00:03:37.739> itself<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.640> put<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
cool all by itself but I put it on a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.600 
cool all by itself but I put it on a
table<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.500> needed<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:41.010> supporting

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
table because it needed a supporting

table because it needed a supporting
structure<00:03:42.239> what<00:03:42.989> makes<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.470> really<00:03:43.650> majestic

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.699 
structure what makes it really majestic
is<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.820> huge<00:03:45.270> table<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:45.959> could<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.320> just<00:03:46.500> put

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
is this huge table I could have just put

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.560 
is this huge table I could have just put
it<00:03:46.830> down<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.250> ground<00:03:47.370> level<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.209> build<00:03:48.390> it

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
it down on the ground level and build it

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.090 
it down on the ground level and build it
that<00:03:48.750> way<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.050> would<00:03:49.140> have<00:03:49.170> been<00:03:49.350> cool<00:03:49.560> but

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
that way it would have been cool but

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.620 
that way it would have been cool but
this<00:03:50.310> made<00:03:50.550> all<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.940> difference<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.510> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
this made all the difference in the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.320 
this made all the difference in the
world<00:03:51.830> so<00:03:52.830> make<00:03:53.400> sure<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.820> include<00:03:54.060> those

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
world so make sure you include those

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.310 
world so make sure you include those
supporting<00:03:54.900> structures<00:03:56.570> number<00:03:57.570> eight<00:03:57.720> add

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
supporting structures number eight add

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.070 
supporting structures number eight add
motion<00:03:58.790> if<00:03:59.790> we<00:03:59.880> take<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> look<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.750> nether

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
motion if we take a look at this nether

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.290 
motion if we take a look at this nether
hub<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.950> can<00:04:02.130> see<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.580> there<00:04:02.790> is<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> lot<00:04:03.270> of

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
hub you can see that there is a lot of

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.720 
hub you can see that there is a lot of
motion<00:04:03.989> going<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.380> there<00:04:04.830> are<00:04:04.980> flames<00:04:05.370> and

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
motion going on there are flames and

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.510 
motion going on there are flames and
there<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.239> moving<00:04:06.720> lava<00:04:07.020> in<00:04:07.680> addition<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
there is moving lava in addition to the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.509 
there is moving lava in addition to the
movement<00:04:09.000> within<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.680> nether<00:04:10.680> portal<00:04:11.160> itself

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
movement within the nether portal itself

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.180 
movement within the nether portal itself
put<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.360> all<00:04:12.480> together<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.590> end<00:04:13.800> up<00:04:13.980> with

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
put it all together and you end up with

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.729 
put it all together and you end up with
a<00:04:14.220> lot<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.970> lot<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.420> motion<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:16.320> really

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
a lot of a lot of motion that really

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.400 
a lot of a lot of motion that really
brings<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.250> build<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.760> life<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.299> lot<00:04:19.140> of<00:04:19.200> our

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
brings a build to life a lot of our

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.990 
brings a build to life a lot of our
builds<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.799> fountains<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.459> one<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.910> the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
builds have fountains and one of the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.969 
builds have fountains and one of the
reasons<00:04:21.359> those<00:04:21.600> look<00:04:21.930> good<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.440> because<00:04:22.800> they

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
reasons those look good is because they

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.180 
reasons those look good is because they
bring<00:04:23.160> motion<00:04:23.700> into<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> build<00:04:25.010> number<00:04:26.010> nine

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
bring motion into the build number nine

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.620 
bring motion into the build number nine

example this another church if you take
a<00:04:35.340> look<00:04:35.520> at<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.820> nether<00:04:36.030> Church<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:36.990> realize

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
a look at the nether Church you realize

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.000 
a look at the nether Church you realize
that<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:38.070> has<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.280> dark<00:04:38.900> brooding<00:04:39.920> kind<00:04:40.920> of

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
that it has a dark brooding kind of

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.460 
that it has a dark brooding kind of
ominous<00:04:41.550> mood<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.720> did<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.290> all<00:04:43.440> in

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
ominous mood to it I did it all in

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.100 
ominous mood to it I did it all in
blacks<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.280> reds<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:45.420> really<00:04:45.840> gave<00:04:46.080> it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
blacks and reds and that really gave it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.380 
blacks and reds and that really gave it
that<00:04:46.380> feeling<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:47.340> think<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.700> a<00:04:47.820> mood<00:04:48.090> and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
that feeling so think of a mood and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.480 
that feeling so think of a mood and
follow<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.140> mood<00:04:49.470> with<00:04:49.770> your<00:04:49.800> build<00:04:50.220> and

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
follow that mood with your build and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.110 
follow that mood with your build and
finally<00:04:51.090> number<00:04:51.270> 10<00:04:51.690> steal<00:04:52.620> stuff<00:04:53.120> anything

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
finally number 10 steal stuff anything

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.940 
finally number 10 steal stuff anything
that<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.450> can<00:04:54.600> get<00:04:54.720> ahold<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.170> that<00:04:55.410> helps

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
that you can get ahold of that helps

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.280 
that you can get ahold of that helps
improve<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.430> quality<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.090> your<00:04:57.240> build<00:04:57.690> then

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
improve the quality of your build then

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.100 
improve the quality of your build then
steal<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.830> good<00:04:59.730> example<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.540> hedge<00:05:00.810> maze

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
steal it good example is this hedge maze

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.980 
steal it good example is this hedge maze
this<00:05:01.770> hedge<00:05:02.070> maze<00:05:02.400> was<00:05:02.820> built<00:05:03.150> almost

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
this hedge maze was built almost

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.650 
this hedge maze was built almost
identical<00:05:04.920> to<00:05:04.950> the<00:05:05.340> hedge<00:05:05.580> maze<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.390> movie

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
identical to the hedge maze in the movie

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.510 
identical to the hedge maze in the movie
The<00:05:06.810> Shining<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.440> always<00:05:07.950> thought<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.190> hedge

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
The Shining I always thought that hedge

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.250 
The Shining I always thought that hedge
maze<00:05:08.730> was<00:05:09.030> cool<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.540> wanted<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.990> know<00:05:10.110> what

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
maze was cool and I wanted to know what

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.900 
maze was cool and I wanted to know what
it<00:05:10.350> felt<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:10.710> walk<00:05:11.010> through<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:11.880> I

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
it felt like to walk through it so I

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.320 
it felt like to walk through it so I
duplicated<00:05:12.480> that<00:05:12.990> hedge<00:05:13.290> maze<00:05:13.640> but<00:05:14.640> then<00:05:15.210> I

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
duplicated that hedge maze but then I

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.030 
duplicated that hedge maze but then I
started<00:05:15.690> adding<00:05:15.900> some<00:05:16.290> of<00:05:16.350> my<00:05:16.530> own<00:05:16.710> things

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
started adding some of my own things

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.970 
started adding some of my own things
things<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.060> really<00:05:18.420> made<00:05:18.960> it<00:05:18.990> different<00:05:19.800> and

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
things that really made it different and

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.760 
things that really made it different and
made<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.730> even<00:05:20.910> cooler<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.930> can<00:05:21.960> steal<00:05:22.350> parts

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
made it even cooler you can steal parts

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.620 
made it even cooler you can steal parts
of<00:05:22.920> things<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.460> then<00:05:23.970> build<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.480> into

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
of things and then build it into

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600 
of things and then build it into
something<00:05:24.780> better<00:05:25.320> or<00:05:25.800> maybe<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.310> steal

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
something better or maybe you steal

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.580 
something better or maybe you steal
color<00:05:27.000> combinations<00:05:27.840> or<00:05:28.050> things<00:05:28.350> like<00:05:28.440> that

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
color combinations or things like that

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.250 
color combinations or things like that
there<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.490> no<00:05:29.790> original<00:05:30.090> creativity<00:05:31.050> don't

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
there is no original creativity don't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.510 
there is no original creativity don't

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
built up of something and if you really

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.840 
built up of something and if you really
think<00:05:36.930> about<00:05:37.200> that<00:05:37.380> you<00:05:37.710> realize<00:05:38.070> it's<00:05:38.340> true
