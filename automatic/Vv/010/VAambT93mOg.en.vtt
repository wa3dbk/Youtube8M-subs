00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
take up screen real estate which I would

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
handle it that's when you notice some

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.360 
handle it that's when you notice some
lags<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:04.510> seeing<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:04.900> at<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.830> moment<00:02:06.010> as

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
lags and just seeing it at the moment as

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.800 
lags and just seeing it at the moment as
well<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.210> kind<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.420> strange<00:02:07.630> because

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
well but just kind of strange because

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.859 
well but just kind of strange because
we're<00:02:08.649> not<00:02:08.740> really<00:02:08.890> pushing<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.520> far

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
we're not really pushing it that far

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.450 
we're not really pushing it that far
it's<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.020> commuting<00:02:11.560> in<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.770> game<00:02:12.010> when<00:02:12.370> you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
it's like commuting in a game when you

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.040 
it's like commuting in a game when you
send<00:02:12.700> you<00:02:12.790> all<00:02:12.910> across<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.420> were<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> island
