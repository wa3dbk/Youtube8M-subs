energy<00:02:32.590> drink<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.050> take<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.320> site<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:36.070> as

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
energy drink if you take a site like as

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.309 
energy drink if you take a site like as
a<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.980> excitation<00:02:39.790> well<00:02:40.390> matched<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.050> think

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
a that excitation well matched I think

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.800 
a that excitation well matched I think
it's<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.530> draw<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.239> quite<00:02:43.450> sure<00:02:43.480> whether

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it's a draw I'm not quite sure whether

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.660 
it's a draw I'm not quite sure whether
it's<00:02:44.080> more<00:02:44.319> expensive<00:02:44.530> than<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.220> standard

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
it's more expensive than the standard

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.500 
it's more expensive than the standard
one<00:02:46.110> yeah<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.170> always<00:02:47.739> throw<00:02:48.549> away<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.120> builds
