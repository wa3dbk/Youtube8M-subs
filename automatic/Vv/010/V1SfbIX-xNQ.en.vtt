00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello so here's how to make a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.730
 black crackled golden manicure for 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.280
 start you are going to need these 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.150
 three points of these three polishes so a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 gold varnish I found them at opi I 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.189
 chosen for its brilliance of a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.650
 singer so it's a nail polish that goes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 to make the crackled effect while drying so 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.810
 always from the opi brand and for 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.630
 finish a top coat to boost the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.270
 held to keep a manicure up 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 five or ten days without damaging 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.440
 and then also to shine the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.250
 polish then a nail file I'm going 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.989
 start by preparing my nail 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 so I'm going to read but the sides of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:00.960
 each nail and I will give them all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.539
 the same size once you have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.930
 bed but all your nails do you 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.240
 have it well hands and you can 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.240
 start applying your polishes 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.799
 first step 1 the golden opal varnish so 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.210
 I will put two layers 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:26.990
 because it is very light if you have one 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 a little more covering a single layer 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.860
 will suffice as you can see that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.860
 it's pretty clear 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.530
 so here is the first step 1 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.560
 here is the result after two layers of 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:08.369
 golden varnish I leave well dried 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 almost five minutes i'm going now 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.120
 applied a thin layer of shatter 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.519
 black so it is not necessary to 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.420
 put a lot back because it risks too much 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:28.440
 cover the walleye so a thin layer 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:33.720
 will suffice like this you cover doggie 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.290
 the nail and the crackle effect will be done 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.610
 alone 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.610
 while drying 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.129
 and as you can see the varnish 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.620
 already starting to crack the black and 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:12.970
 you can see just below 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.540
 the walleye I leave well dried pretty much 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.400
 five good minutes 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.980
 once I have applied well 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.349
 let them dry my shatter i'm going 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.450
 as I told you apply my 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.760
 top coat what will allow me to 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.180
 keep my manicure longer and 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.720
 especially to shine the varnish because 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.799
 the black catcher and matte colors 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:43.599
 so I apply a generous layer of 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:49.450
 top coat on each nail and I leave to 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.900
 again well dry I recommend a good 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.900
 fifteen minutes 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:07.040
 as you can see the top coat has 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:11.459
 well done shine and my manicure 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.489
 cracked black gold is impeccable and 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.489
 especially easy to achieve 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.489
 thank you
