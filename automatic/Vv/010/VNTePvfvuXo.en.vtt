to<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.070> dress<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.660> actually<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to this dress so I actually do have a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
to this dress so I actually do have a
paper<00:00:29.010> pattern<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.119> dress<00:00:30.449> because

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
paper pattern for this dress because

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.170 
paper pattern for this dress because
I've<00:00:31.140> used<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.800> several<00:00:32.070> times<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.030> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I've used it several times I like this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
I've used it several times I like this
design<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.750> works<00:00:33.989> better<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.739> body<00:00:34.980> shape

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
design it works better for my body shape

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.750 
design it works better for my body shape
um<00:00:36.140> wait<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.950> now<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
um wait for now we're going to do it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
um wait for now we're going to do it
right<00:00:38.969> onto<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.570> fabric<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.739> you're<00:00:40.920> going

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
right onto the fabric what you're going

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.529 
right onto the fabric what you're going
to<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:43.579> measurement<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:45.239> your

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to need first is a measurement for your

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.920 
to need first is a measurement for your
top<00:00:46.280> I've<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.879> chest<00:00:48.450> measurement

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
top I've use this chest measurement

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
top I've use this chest measurement
because<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> smaller<00:00:49.920> measurement<00:00:50.730> than

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
because it's a smaller measurement than

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.330 
because it's a smaller measurement than
a<00:00:52.140> bust<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> fit<00:00:55.110> snug<00:00:55.770> through

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
a bust and I want it to fit snug through

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.720 
a bust and I want it to fit snug through
the<00:00:56.430> top<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.270> measurement<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.079> 48<00:00:58.730> I'm

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the top so that measurement is 48 I'm

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.360 
the top so that measurement is 48 I'm
going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.090> divide<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.930> measurement<00:01:01.590> by<00:01:01.859> 4

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
going to divide the measurement by 4

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.740 
going to divide the measurement by 4
because<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.840> working<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> fold<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
because you're working on the fold of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.330 
because you're working on the fold of
the<00:01:06.810> fabric<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.260> with<00:01:10.260> working<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> fold

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the fabric so with working on the fold

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
the fabric so with working on the fold
of<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> fabric<00:01:11.960> you're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.320> working

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of the fabric you're going to be working

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
of the fabric you're going to be working
with<00:01:13.890> half<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.760> pattern<00:01:15.150> cutting<00:01:15.930> through

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
with half the pattern cutting through

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
with half the pattern cutting through
all<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:17.220> layers<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.759> fabric<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.240> once<00:01:18.509> my

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
all of my layers of fabric at once my

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
all of my layers of fabric at once my
front<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.080> back<00:01:19.140> are<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
front and my back are going to be the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.160 
front and my back are going to be the
exact<00:01:20.580> same<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.720> yard

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
exact same so I have this is a yard

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
exact same so I have this is a yard
folded<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.400> yards<00:01:26.790> once<00:01:27.030> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
folded but it's two yards once you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.330 
folded but it's two yards once you
spread<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.390> out<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.780> there<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.950> four

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
spread it out so there are actually four

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
spread it out so there are actually four
layers<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.880> fabric<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
layers of fabric that I'm going to be

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.140 
layers of fabric that I'm going to be
working<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.920> actually<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.579> folds

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
working with there's actually two folds

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.810 
working with there's actually two folds
here<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.200> four<00:01:34.530> open<00:01:35.159> pieces<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
here and then four open pieces on the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
here and then four open pieces on the
side<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.479> gonna<00:01:36.659> find<00:01:38.479> 12<00:01:39.479> inches<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
side I'm gonna find 12 inches on this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.060 
side I'm gonna find 12 inches on this
ruler<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:43.009> then<00:01:45.049> you're<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> draw<00:01:46.829> that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
ruler and then you're going to draw that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.030 
ruler and then you're going to draw that
line<00:01:48.680> across<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.100> top

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
line across the top

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040 
line across the top
there's<00:01:53.040> 12<00:01:53.430> inches<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:54.270> lights<00:01:54.510> just<00:01:54.870> goes

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
there's 12 inches my lights just goes

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.160 
there's 12 inches my lights just goes
down<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:55.980> bit<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.580> know

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
down just a little bit so you know

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
down just a little bit so you know
exactly<00:01:58.170> where<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.770> stops<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> you're<00:02:00.870> going

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
exactly where that stops so you're going

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.600 
exactly where that stops so you're going
to<00:02:01.110> go<00:02:01.230> from<00:02:01.470> your<00:02:01.680> armpit<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.870> where<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
to go from your armpit to where the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.840 
to go from your armpit to where the
bottom<00:02:05.970> of<00:02:06.060> your<00:02:06.180> broadband<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:08.729> know

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
bottom of your broadband is and I know

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.760 
bottom of your broadband is and I know
from<00:02:09.210> experience<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.200> six<00:02:10.560> inches

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
from experience that's like six inches

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.360 
from experience that's like six inches
on<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.970> particular<00:02:12.450> rule<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.050> actually<00:02:13.370> six

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
on this particular rule is actually six

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.170 
on this particular rule is actually six
inches<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.940> length<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:16.460> I'm<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.880> going<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
inches in length so I'm just going to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.370 
inches in length so I'm just going to
draw<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:20.460> 12<00:02:20.850> inches<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.720> I'm<00:02:22.110> going<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
draw that 12 inches and I'm going to

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:38.120 
draw that 12 inches and I'm going to
draw<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.160> way<00:02:24.350> around<00:02:27.440> step<00:02:35.570> okay<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:38.100> I

measure down I manage down to the ends

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:27.470 
measure down I manage down to the ends
of<00:03:19.830> my<00:03:20.100> fabric<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:26.160> gives<00:03:26.459> me<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:26.850> 29

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
of my fabric and that gives me like 29

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.650 
of my fabric and that gives me like 29
inches<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.209> gonna<00:03:30.360> mark<00:03:31.820> right<00:03:32.820> at<00:03:33.030> 29

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
inches so I'm gonna mark right at 29

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:44.680 
inches so I'm gonna mark right at 29
inches<00:03:36.680> that's<00:03:37.680> gonna<00:03:37.890> draw<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:41.420> line<00:03:42.420> out<00:03:43.380> from

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
inches that's gonna draw a line out from

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.690 
inches that's gonna draw a line out from
that<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:48.600> I'm<00:03:49.590> just<00:03:49.830> looking<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.400> make

that and I'm just looking now to make

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.250 
that and I'm just looking now to make

sure because these lines I want this
line<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.190> numbers<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:54.000> match<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.540> with<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
line on the numbers to match up with the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.190 
line on the numbers to match up with the
edge<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:56.100> my<00:03:56.160> fabric<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:57.480> it's<00:03:57.870> going<00:03:58.049> to

edge of my fabric so that it's going to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.340 
edge of my fabric so that it's going to
be<00:03:58.380> at<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> 90

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350
