00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
stuff and not showing candy there is a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.000 
stuff and not showing candy there is a
cascoon<00:03:54.629> so<00:03:55.629> really<00:03:55.930> nothing<00:03:56.230> worth<00:03:56.590> leaving

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
cascoon so really nothing worth leaving

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.380 
cascoon so really nothing worth leaving
so<00:03:57.400> far<00:03:59.190> so<00:04:00.190> what<00:04:00.370> we<00:04:00.459> guess<00:04:00.579> not<00:04:00.790> all<00:04:01.030> just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
so far so what we guess not all just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.819 
so far so what we guess not all just
commons<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.840> uncommons<00:04:01.930> i<00:04:02.590> would<00:04:02.709> really

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
commons and uncommons i would really

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.610 
commons and uncommons i would really
suck<00:04:03.510> another<00:04:04.510> fletchinder<00:04:07.349> would<00:04:08.349> be<00:04:08.440> weird

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
suck another fletchinder would be weird

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.750 
suck another fletchinder would be weird
because<00:04:08.799> that<00:04:09.069> would<00:04:09.190> technically<00:04:09.519> be<00:04:09.610> a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
because that would technically be a

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.360 
because that would technically be a
thirty<00:04:10.150> dollar<00:04:10.440> purchase<00:04:11.440> for<00:04:11.769> some<00:04:12.069> candy

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
thirty dollar purchase for some candy

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.289 
thirty dollar purchase for some candy
and<00:04:14.160> good<00:04:15.160> as<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.370> might<00:04:15.549> be<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:15.879> not<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.269> I

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
and good as it might be it's not that I

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.909 
and good as it might be it's not that I
dollars<00:04:16.630> good<00:04:16.840> there<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.260> no<00:04:17.410> candy<00:04:17.739> that's

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
dollars good there is no candy that's

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.469 
dollars good there is no candy that's
thirty<00:04:18.100> dollars<00:04:18.459> good<00:04:18.639> and<00:04:19.169> a<00:04:20.169> dustox<00:04:21.479> so

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
thirty dollars good and a dustox so

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.500 
thirty dollars good and a dustox so
that's<00:04:23.400> half<00:04:24.400> of<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.760> video<00:04:25.000> right<00:04:25.240> there

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
that's half of the video right there

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.620 
that's half of the video right there
that's<00:04:26.410> half<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.889> cards<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:28.210> move<00:04:28.419> this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
that's half of the cards and move this

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.580 
that's half of the cards and move this
divider<00:04:28.990> over<00:04:29.440> so<00:04:29.620> we<00:04:29.740> can<00:04:31.199> throw<00:04:32.199> those<00:04:32.350> all
