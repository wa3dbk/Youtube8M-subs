00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.810 
just opens up it's like bottle of coke
and<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.860> called<00:03:18.070> grey<00:03:18.340> fox<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.650> in<00:03:21.130> Canada

I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.100> wine<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:24.970> states<00:03:25.300> is

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
I think the the wine in the states is

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.580 
I think the the wine in the states is
much<00:03:25.720> more<00:03:25.930> expensive

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
much more expensive

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.420 
much more expensive

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
this is Apothic red which is probably

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.860 
this is Apothic red which is probably
the<00:04:29.259> nicest<00:04:29.770> line<00:04:30.250> I've<00:04:30.490> had<00:04:30.819> so<00:04:31.150> far<00:04:31.180> ensure

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
there's better quality wines I'm not a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.670 
there's better quality wines I'm not a
wine<00:04:34.569> expert<00:04:35.610> but<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.389> also<00:04:37.599> from<00:04:37.900> 2012

and so this one in Canada this 750
milliliters<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:45.030> think<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.210> cost<00:04:46.770> fifty

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770

milliliters I think this cost fifty
fifteen<00:04:48.400> dollars<00:04:48.819> and<00:04:49.270> this<00:04:50.199> one<00:04:51.120> which<00:04:52.120> is

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
fifteen dollars and this one which is

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.930 
fifteen dollars and this one which is
what<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.590> get<00:04:53.770> twice<00:04:54.039> as<00:04:54.099> much<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.699> its<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:56.940> 1.5

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940
