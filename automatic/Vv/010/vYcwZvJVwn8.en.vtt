00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 ay what about all kids is shining 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.350
 once again here and good as you are 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.779
 watching a new trick to get 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.660
 very much rpp and a lot of money so 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.429
 we started and it's good to start the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.370
 starting what we have to do is that 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.830
 we will be online and now we have to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.630
 give lists of items and list of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 departure to my list of marked items 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 and there we choose the only one that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 I have that is main with him we give him that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 if we accept and once we have accepted 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 the activity this is very important 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.529
 because the notices are marked by 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.500
 defect we have to make it difficult 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.630
 one with one and a half of rpp because that's how we 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.730
 is going to give even more money than not 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 is supposed to give us the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 activity and good now what we have 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.100
 what to do is simply take our 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 car and we headed to the van 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 it's worth the blue dot that appears to us and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.340
 simply what we have to do is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 steal it and once we break it then 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.539
 let's say we basically have the trick 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.710
 half done good before nothing when 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 we are going to arrive we are going to find 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.859
 with a bridge like you are seeing now 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
 same and we have to kill the two 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.670
 thugs these we're seeing here 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.290
 be very careful with that because 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 example to me in my case I kill one of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.409
 them okay says a little and the Mongolian and the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.539
 Anyway , once you have it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 you do not have to leave the car as you have 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.020
 I've explained to you why you have to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.969
 leave it like that because if he does not have the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.799
 van let's say you run out a 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.810
 Once we've put it there's that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.030
 this way you are going to see how he has 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.619
 moreover to know how to collide and such and what 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 you have to do is catch in kill the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.369
 uncle and now you are running towards the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.049
 trevor house do not worry because 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 if you do not know how to get to appear in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.229
 minimap and this is very important a 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.719
 Once we are arriving at the house of 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.369
 clover what we have to do is not 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.619
 deliver it if you are 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.149
 listening we do not deliver the van 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.409
 because what we're going to do is like 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.689
 you are watching right now we are going to 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.860
 leave here as is and we will go to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.659
 to walk 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.129
 the fact is that you are going to say but 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.629
 Well, this is because because if we 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:52.439
 let's go for a spin let's say we 

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:54.569
 they give more rpp and more money if we do 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.250
 well ten or fifteen minutes you imagine 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.289
 not now you are going to see how much he gave me 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.500
 for just being here in a while and 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.219
 let's say that if you are with friends you have 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.109
 the whole salt 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.969
 is going to give you still much more rpp and 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.500
 much more money to each and every one 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.599
 of you and good as you are going to see 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.190
 now I'm going to deliver the van and you go 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.170
 to see that in less than we count but 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.069
 it will take a minute even less is it going to 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.780
 give a lot 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.349
 money as you are seeing right now is not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.389
 das 7.310 of money and 1345 of pepe 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.659
 a lot and good kids, let's say 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.540
