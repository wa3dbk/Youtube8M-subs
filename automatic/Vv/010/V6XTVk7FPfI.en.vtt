will<00:00:47.700> end<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.180> stepping<00:00:48.450> way<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
will end up stepping way out here and

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
will end up stepping way out here and
they'll<00:00:49.860> try<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> throw<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:52.110> while<00:00:52.320> they're

stepping<00:00:52.739> way<00:00:53.070> off<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> side<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
stepping way off to the side and the the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260 
stepping way off to the side and the the
biggest<00:00:55.860> thing<00:00:56.039> I'll<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.940> lack<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
biggest thing I'll see is the lack of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
biggest thing I'll see is the lack of
use<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> front<00:00:58.109> arm<00:00:58.350> where<00:00:58.829> they'll<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
use of the front arm where they'll just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
use of the front arm where they'll just
let<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> front<00:00:59.730> arm<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.390> hang<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
let this front arm just kind of hang and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
let this front arm just kind of hang and
then<00:01:01.289> they'll<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.710> throw<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> ball<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.820> no

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
then they'll just throw the ball with no

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.509 
then they'll just throw the ball with no
fort<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.750> no<00:01:03.780> arm<00:01:04.140> movement<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.489> a
