00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
buildings that are all part of the

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.640 
buildings that are all part of the
university<00:07:28.220> and<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.580> so<00:07:29.670> NYU<00:07:29.970> is<00:07:30.420> quite<00:07:31.350> a<00:07:31.380> big

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650 
university and and so NYU is quite a big

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.850 
university and and so NYU is quite a big
school<00:07:32.040> and<00:07:32.310> it's<00:07:32.430> actually<00:07:32.820> had<00:07:32.970> a<00:07:33.000> lot<00:07:33.270> of

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:33.860 
school and it's actually had a lot of

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.860 
school and it's actually had a lot of
famous<00:07:34.860> people<00:07:35.010> people<00:07:35.880> you<00:07:36.300> recognize<00:07:36.750> the

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:36.870 
famous people people you recognize the

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.380 
famous people people you recognize the
names<00:07:37.080> of<00:07:37.290> that<00:07:38.070> I<00:07:38.130> graduated<00:07:38.850> from<00:07:39.090> there

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.390 
names of that I graduated from there

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.260 
names of that I graduated from there
particularly<00:07:40.170> quite<00:07:40.620> a<00:07:40.650> few<00:07:40.890> actors<00:07:41.790> because

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.270 
particularly quite a few actors because

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.860 
particularly quite a few actors because
it<00:07:42.990> specializes<00:07:43.620> in<00:07:44.010> in<00:07:44.220> the<00:07:44.370> arts<00:07:44.640> or<00:07:45.000> it<00:07:45.720> has

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870 
it specializes in in the arts or it has

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.630 
it specializes in in the arts or it has
a<00:07:45.900> School<00:07:46.410> of<00:07:46.440> Arts<00:07:46.830> which<00:07:47.010> is<00:07:47.040> within<00:07:47.370> it

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640 
a School of Arts which is within it

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.580 
a School of Arts which is within it
which<00:07:48.240> I<00:07:48.420> guess<00:07:48.540> is<00:07:48.690> particularly<00:07:49.050> good<00:07:49.470> and

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590 
which I guess is particularly good and

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.280 
which I guess is particularly good and
there's<00:07:49.740> a<00:07:49.800> lot<00:07:49.980> of<00:07:50.720> people<00:07:51.720> that<00:07:51.990> have<00:07:52.170> come

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.290 
there's a lot of people that have come

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.210 
there's a lot of people that have come
through<00:07:52.470> that<00:07:52.890> program<00:07:53.100> that<00:07:53.520> have

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.220 
through that program that have

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.880 
through that program that have
have<00:07:54.700> made<00:07:54.880> it<00:07:55.030> big<00:07:55.210> another<00:07:56.080> building<00:07:56.680> that's

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:56.890 
have made it big another building that's

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.390 
have made it big another building that's
part<00:07:57.190> of<00:07:57.310> the<00:07:57.520> NYU<00:07:58.000> camp
