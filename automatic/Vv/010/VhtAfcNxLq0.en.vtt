00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:23.000
 Seas and mountains I will cross, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.930
 I will find you again in your land. 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.129
 Winds, storms I will ride. 

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.500
 I die between lightning to have you. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.340
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.230
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 It's his look, two suns burning the dawn. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.920
 I love life, wonderful. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.609
 You shine in my eyes, you shine on me. 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:01:20.650
 I want to be the moon to caress you. 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.650
 I hang from your dreams, I veil over you. 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.650
 Do not wake up, do not wake up ... Now. 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.650
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 It's his look, and I can not find the words. 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.650
 I love life, wonderful. 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 Wonderful creature, you face the world. 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 Wonderful madness, feel together. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.940
 It's his look, two suns burning the dawn. 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.180
 I love life, wonderful ... 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.490
 Wonderful...
