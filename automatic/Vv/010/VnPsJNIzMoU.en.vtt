in a matter of seconds every time you

in this episode we'll be taking a look

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.020 
in this episode we'll be taking a look
at<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.110> best<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.219> redeploy<00:00:56.699> from

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
at when it's best just to redeploy from

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
at when it's best just to redeploy from
the<00:00:57.149> base<00:00:57.360> you're<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> may<00:00:58.559> have

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the base you're in now you may have

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
the base you're in now you may have
noticed<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.430> basis<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.210> they're

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
noticed that some basis when they're

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.430 
noticed that some basis when they're
being<00:01:00.480> captured<00:01:00.750> by<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> enemy<00:01:01.079> are

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
being captured by the enemy are

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.410 
being captured by the enemy are
effectively<00:01:02.160> put<00:01:02.489> under<00:01:02.760> siege<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.000> both

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
effectively put under siege by both

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.710 
effectively put under siege by both
aircraft<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.379> armor<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.790> poses<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
aircraft and armor and this poses to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
aircraft and armor and this poses to
problems<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> defenders<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.400> first<00:01:08.610> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
problems to the defenders the first is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
problems to the defenders the first is
that<00:01:08.850> aircraft<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.780> tanks<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.320> pretty<00:01:10.530> much

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that aircraft and tanks can pretty much

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.310 
that aircraft and tanks can pretty much
one<00:01:11.100> shot<00:01:11.430> any<00:01:11.700> infantryman<00:01:12.420> therefore<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
one shot any infantryman therefore as a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.020 
one shot any infantryman therefore as a
new<00:01:13.530> player<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.369> outside<00:01:14.520> you're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
new player if you go outside you're

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
new player if you go outside you're
going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.299> killed<00:01:15.570> pretty<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.320> instantly

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
going to be killed pretty much instantly

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.340 
going to be killed pretty much instantly
the<00:01:17.460> second<00:01:17.850> problem<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> bottle

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the second problem is that it bottle

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
the second problem is that it bottle
next<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> defenders<00:01:20.400> even<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.150> safe

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
next the defenders even if you're safe

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.719 
next the defenders even if you're safe
inside<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:22.170> enemy<00:01:22.470> aircraft<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.310> tanks

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
inside from enemy aircraft and tanks

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.149 
inside from enemy aircraft and tanks
there's<00:01:24.210> only<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> few<00:01:24.840> limited<00:01:25.439> paths<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.009> can

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
there's only a few limited paths you can

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.429 
there's only a few limited paths you can
use<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.880> avoid<00:01:27.270> being<00:01:27.570> exposed<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.290> their

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
use which avoid being exposed to their

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.190 
use which avoid being exposed to their
attacks<00:01:28.799> ie<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.119> bottlenecked<00:01:30.869> into<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
attacks ie you get bottlenecked into a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160 
attacks ie you get bottlenecked into a
very<00:01:31.619> small<00:01:31.740> narrow<00:01:32.579> corridor<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.720> attackers

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
very small narrow corridor the attackers

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.719 
very small narrow corridor the attackers
will<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.189> line<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
will know this and then line that

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
will know this and then line that
bottleneck<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.689> loads<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> Defense's<00:01:37.650> such

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
bottleneck with loads of Defense's such

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.550 
bottleneck with loads of Defense's such
as<00:01:38.189> engineer<00:01:39.060> turrets<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.170> end<00:01:40.470> up

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
as engineer turrets it will also end up

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.929 
as engineer turrets it will also end up
probably<00:01:40.740> getting<00:01:41.070> saturated<00:01:41.280> with

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
probably getting saturated with

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
probably getting saturated with
explosives<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.290> ends<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.649> happening<00:01:43.710> in

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
explosives so what ends up happening in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
explosives so what ends up happening in
practice<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.180> soon<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> leave

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
practice is that as soon as you leave

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050 
practice is that as soon as you leave
your<00:01:45.990> spawn<00:01:46.320> room<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.950> able<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.310> outside<00:01:47.490> or

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
your spawn room be able to go outside or

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
your spawn room be able to go outside or
inside<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.229> get<00:01:49.439> massacred<00:01:49.920> with

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
inside you get massacred with

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
inside you get massacred with
effectively<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.630> chance<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.259> fighting<00:01:52.619> back

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
effectively no chance of fighting back

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
effectively no chance of fighting back
now<00:01:53.310> many<00:01:53.880> new<00:01:54.090> players<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> mistake<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
now many new players make the mistake of

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050 
now many new players make the mistake of
constantly<00:01:55.920> redeploying<00:01:56.579> after<00:01:56.909> being

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
constantly redeploying after being

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.219 
constantly redeploying after being
killed<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> getting<00:01:57.840> killed<00:01:58.079> again

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
killed and getting killed again

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
killed and getting killed again
instantly<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.939> having<00:02:00.180> such<00:02:00.479> a

instantly and then having such a

instantly and then having such a
miserable<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.680> want<00:02:01.860> to

of enemy aircraft and armor and the best

of enemy aircraft and armor and the best
way<00:02:44.519> to<00:02:44.640> do<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.329> redeploy<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
way to do that is to redeploy to a

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.800 
way to do that is to redeploy to a
nearby<00:02:46.709> base<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.370> pick<00:02:47.609> up<00:02:47.790> your<00:02:48.120> own<00:02:48.329> armor

now<00:02:49.590> remember<00:02:49.799> tanks<00:02:50.280> received<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.730> lot<00:02:51.030> more

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
now remember tanks received a lot more

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.819 
now remember tanks received a lot more

they are on the front effectively they

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.569 
they are on the front effectively they

the base you can often take them by
