cards<00:00:04.549> once<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.670> little<00:00:05.790> bit<00:00:06.000> faster<00:00:06.509> than<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
cards once a little bit faster than the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.259 
cards once a little bit faster than the
other<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.350> say<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.680> least<00:00:07.940> this<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.120> the

other to say the least this is the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.580 
other to say the least this is the
extreme<00:00:09.870> Pro<00:00:10.290> it's<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.630> scan<00:00:12.630> disk<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.440> can

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
extreme Pro it's a scan disk and you can

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.169 
extreme Pro it's a scan disk and you can
see<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> has<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.580> little<00:00:14.759> symbol

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
see here it has this little symbol

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.099 
see here it has this little symbol
that's<00:00:15.690> an<00:00:15.900> SDHC<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:17.690> these<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> newer

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that's an SDHC one these are the newer

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.500 
that's an SDHC one these are the newer
ones<00:00:19.470> sometimes<00:00:20.460> they'll<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
ones sometimes they'll have a one with a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.670 
ones sometimes they'll have a one with a
little<00:00:21.810> horseshoe<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.670> bottom<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.680> here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
little horseshoe on the bottom and here

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.130 
little horseshoe on the bottom and here
I<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.980> an<00:00:26.130> older<00:00:27.619> SDHC<00:00:28.619> card<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:30.210> I'm<00:00:30.630> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
I have an older SDHC card so I'm just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
I have an older SDHC card so I'm just
going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.349> show<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> difference<00:00:32.719> instead

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
going to show you the difference instead

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:49.830 
going to show you the difference instead
of<00:00:33.870> talking<00:00:34.079> about<00:00:34.500> them<00:00:37.190> go

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:36.270 

test<00:00:50.560> two<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.979> one

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:02:39.089 

and<00:01:38.020> test<00:01:39.020> two<00:01:47.530> that's<00:01:48.530> 15<00:01:49.159> 16<00:01:49.970> 17<00:01:51.850> 18<00:01:54.220> 19<00:01:58.390> 20

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.850 

so<00:02:40.099> this<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.629> what<00:02:41.629> you<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.930> get<00:02:42.110> from<00:02:42.290> Amazon

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
so this is what you can get from Amazon

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.180 
so this is what you can get from Amazon
for<00:02:43.129> under<00:02:43.420> $500<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.410> now<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.620> actually<00:02:45.950> came

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
for under $500 and now it actually came

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.809 
for under $500 and now it actually came
in<00:02:46.549> I<00:02:46.849> believe<00:02:47.780> maybe<00:02:48.049> three<00:02:48.799> packages<00:02:49.250> total

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
in I believe maybe three packages total

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.460 
in I believe maybe three packages total
they<00:02:50.030> actually<00:02:50.390> will<00:02:50.629> group<00:02:50.989> your<00:02:51.200> things

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
they actually will group your things

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.739 
they actually will group your things
together
