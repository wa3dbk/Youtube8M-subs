00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
going to start blending my pointer here

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.330 
going to start blending my pointer here
because<00:01:20.119> i'm<00:01:20.270> more<00:01:20.920> dexterous<00:01:21.920> with<00:01:22.190> my

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
and hammer off quickly so it's going to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.770 
and hammer off quickly so it's going to
sound<00:01:27.259> like<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:28.270> so<00:01:29.270> she's<00:01:29.420> going<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.630> be<00:01:29.690> an

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
quickly move it over to the third on the

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.330 
quickly move it over to the third on the
low<00:02:39.939> E<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.749> I'm<00:02:41.379> going<00:02:41.499> to<00:02:41.560> use<00:02:41.650> my<00:02:41.680> pointer<00:02:42.010> to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
low E and I'm going to use my pointer to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.170 
low E and I'm going to use my pointer to
hammer<00:02:42.579> on<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.689> second<00:02:44.079> on<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:46.060> it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
hammer on on the second on the a so it's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.870 
hammer on on the second on the a so it's
going<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.359> sound<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:46.659> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.030 

so<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.000> whole<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.540> whole<00:02:50.570> mini<00:02:51.530> part<00:02:51.830> is

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
so the whole that whole mini part is

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.430 
so the whole that whole mini part is
like

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.260 

so<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.620> whole<00:03:00.860> part<00:03:01.430> from<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.970> minor

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
so that whole part from that a minor

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.470 
so that whole part from that a minor
that<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.900> minor<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.380> going<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.680> like

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.770 

I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.409> floor<00:03:09.440> switch

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.210 

and<00:03:14.470> when<00:03:14.590> you're<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.830> going<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.040> keep

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
and when you're just going to keep

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.839 
and when you're just going to keep
playing

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.460 

however<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.970> song<00:03:19.120> goes

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.470 

yeah<00:03:24.470> that's<00:03:24.980> pretty<00:03:25.310> much<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.909> think

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
yeah that's pretty much it I think

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.910 
yeah that's pretty much it I think
that's<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.689> part<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.900> wanted<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.409> hope<00:03:27.739> it's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
that's the part you wanted I hope it's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.340 
that's the part you wanted I hope it's
not<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.099> solo
