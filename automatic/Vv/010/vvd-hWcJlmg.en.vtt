00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.910
 Welcome to Fabiano in 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.820
 this workshop I would like to give you one 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.220
 gamut fingering show her 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.529
 Maybe he does not know that yet 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.650
 certainly has advantages and indeed affects 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.320
 this is mainly the left hand of the 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.000
 trick is that you left the 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.260
 thumb after the black keys 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.869
 at the final game of the scale 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.220
 stocky that is in the classical 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.750
 finger set actually not there 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.780
 It does not matter on the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.699
 black button comes one also sets the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.199
 Fingers the thumb for a white 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.909
 grope one has since however much 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.830
 less space around the thumb 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.320
 to execute properly 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.830
 i want you to look at the hardware 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.449
 scale shows the scale is 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.600
 maybe a bit unusual 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.549
 many think about five crosses I think 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.190
 I would rather go a bit but 

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.739
 has he has the great advantage you can 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.350
 They also play a piano very well there 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.449
 she rarely wears that is they are 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.960
 all the black keys are there 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.250
 and the sounds h &amp; m as the only thing you can 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.670
 the sounds are always the same 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.539
 thumb 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.460
 so you can remember that very well 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.429
 These exercises I show you is 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.320
 from my book piano fitness finds there 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:25.250
 her also a lot of other exercises 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 had to do the halo had like 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.010
 said literally jumps into the eye 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.120
 the thumb on the h 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 Switzerland has two black buttons 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.930
 thumb on the way 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:47.170
 the threesome and have a great 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.610
 Exercise around this finger set 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 internalize and the scale as 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.250
 To exercise a handle looks like this 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.250
 the second group together underneath 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.460
 alone 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.270
 the threesome together that one can 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 continue this way now 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.700
 and down on 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.050
 that's the normal standard now 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 nevertheless a classic 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.620
 piano lesson thumb 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.250
 Thumb, subset 33 of this scale 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.240
 finger that is really standard has in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.709
 the right hand your just the advantage 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.420
 that comes after a black key 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.340
 means you have a lot of space around the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 thumb under there to wander through 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.400
 to let 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.150
 so it is wonderful hand if you 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.870
 this pattern is now on the left hand 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.670
 translates that means thumb 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.140
 always after the black keys comes 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.310
 to a very special finger 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.519
 you should start with the fourth 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.519
 finger 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.270
 the thumb again the wertinger on the thumb 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.270
 blacklist 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.109
 the third figure 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.260
 now when playing is the advantage 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.260
 only really clear 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.069
 button thumb bottom with plenty of space 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.130
 because you can even this exercise of just 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.130
 wonderfully apply 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.860
 Next 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.160
 so hbo will do really well 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.770
 he also comes in the construction of the hand 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.150
 very convenient 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.410
 holzinger faith always comes to the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.450
 white and the long come on the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.170
 black keys so that corresponds to the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.210
 natural attitude very much if you 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.170
 this principle now on the left hand 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.360
 transfers on the left it is especially important 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.620
 was right you have this pedestal after 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.240
 the black key is actually on 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.030
 given to almost all scales 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.560
 left off that is if that is now 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.460
 for example, in the a major scale 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.460
 looks at yourself 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.630
 three crosses 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.790
 and is 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.960
 Come on, I'm thanking you for a fingering sentence 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.960
 use the second finger 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.460
 now comes the finger 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.000
 now led 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.870
 and now comes the advantage that again 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.870
 subordinate neighborhood 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.360
 that's right anyway 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.520
 Add the squat comes so 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.919
 right you have this problem actually 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.360
 not just in the left hand when I'm there 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.360
 the classic fingering set would take 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.960
 institutional 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.290
 I have already translated of white 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.290
 on white 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.449
 now play forwards 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.449
 no problem 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.510
 is not as comfortable as black 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.510
 case 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.699
 So is wonderful this principle 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.699
 Of course , all tones could be used 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.820
 transferred especially for the left hand 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.660
 for example tonart I also start 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.660
 with the second finger 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.430
 on the black boxes if I am now 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.430
 transfer this exercise 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.070
 sounds pretty proud but is very 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.070
 effectively
