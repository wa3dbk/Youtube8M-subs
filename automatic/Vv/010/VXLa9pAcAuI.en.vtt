find in also 3 version 1.1 but it is in
my<00:00:37.469> opinion<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.920> biggest<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.700> most<00:00:39.270> glowing

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
accurately portrayed in this video just

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.350 
accurately portrayed in this video just
because<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> way<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.820> video<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.180> recorded

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
because of the way the video is recorded

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.470 
because of the way the video is recorded
it's<00:00:48.870> hard<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.820> get<00:00:50.820> across<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it's hard to kind of get across to you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's hard to kind of get across to you
how<00:00:51.780> much<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.289> responsive<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:54.000> trust

quick<00:01:21.479> switch<00:01:21.720> you're<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.259> after<00:01:22.729> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
quick switch you're right after you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.910

switch<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> an<00:01:24.840> app<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.590> quickly

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
switch to an app so you can quickly

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
switch between apps using a quick

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
switch between apps using a quick
switcher<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.750> 100%<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.079> super<00:01:31.740> fast

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
switcher it's not 100% like super fast

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
switcher it's not 100% like super fast
like<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.750> for<00:01:33.750> instance<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:34.140> week<00:01:34.320> liked<00:01:34.530> age

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
like you for instance at week liked age

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
like you for instance at week liked age
and<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.670> quick<00:01:35.970> switcher<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:37.259> think

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and it's quick switcher I don't think

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
and it's quick switcher I don't think
it's<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.860> fast<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.520> tej<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.659> definitely

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
it's as fast as tej but it is definitely

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's as fast as tej but it is definitely
I<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.549> telling<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.360> much

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
I mean I'm telling you it's it's much

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.260 
I mean I'm telling you it's it's much
more<00:01:43.380> responsive<00:01:43.770> than<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> past<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
more responsive than in the past and I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.060 
more responsive than in the past and I
think<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.689> definitely<00:01:45.990> should<00:01:46.409> try<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.860> out

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
think you definitely should try it out

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
think you definitely should try it out
now<00:01:47.479> not<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.780> shouldn't<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.110> tried<00:01:49.259> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
now not that you shouldn't have tried it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.780 
now not that you shouldn't have tried it
in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> past<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> quick<00:01:50.430> switchers

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
in the past because the quick switchers
