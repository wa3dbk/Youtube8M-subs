yeah I'm just letting you guys know what
I<00:00:46.770> used<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:48.059> color<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
I used for the color and I also use this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.410 
I used for the color and I also use this
for<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.219> time<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> neutral<00:00:51.059> protein

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
for the first time the neutral protein

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.470 
for the first time the neutral protein
filler<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
filler this is so that if your here is

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.850 
filler this is so that if your here is
over-processed<00:00:54.480> or<00:00:54.930> anything<00:00:55.110> it'll<00:00:55.620> make

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
over-processed or anything it'll make

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
over-processed or anything it'll make
your<00:00:56.039> hair<00:00:56.760> color<00:00:57.329> come<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.079> one

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
your hair color come out all in one

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.229 
your hair color come out all in one
color<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> neutral<00:00:59.879> protein

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
color and this is the neutral protein

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
color and this is the neutral protein
filler<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.719> colorful<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> from

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
filler from colorful and I got this from

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470 
filler from colorful and I got this from
Sally's<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.879> I've<00:01:02.969> never<00:01:03.149> used<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.420> before

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
Sally's and I've never used this before

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.210 
Sally's and I've never used this before
but<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> saw<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> bunch<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.650> good<00:01:04.860> reviews

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but I saw a bunch of really good reviews

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
but I saw a bunch of really good reviews
about<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> decided<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.240> try<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.689> just

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
about it so I decided to try it out just

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
about it so I decided to try it out just
in<00:01:07.080> case<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:08.369> over<00:01:08.700> process<00:01:09.060> my<00:01:09.210> hair<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
in case I have over process my hair it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
in case I have over process my hair it
doesn't<00:01:09.659> look<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.890> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
doesn't look like I have but just in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
doesn't look like I have but just in
case<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.430> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.820> sure<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.210> my<00:01:12.240> color

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
case I want to be sure that my color

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
case I want to be sure that my color
came<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:12.990> even<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.310> doesn't<00:01:14.580> hurt<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
came out even and it doesn't hurt to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
came out even and it doesn't hurt to
have<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.600> extra<00:01:15.840> protein<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.350> my

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
have a little bit extra protein in my

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
have a little bit extra protein in my
hair<00:01:16.590> anyway<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.490> am<00:01:18.030> color<00:01:18.479> treated

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
hair anyway because I am color treated

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539 
hair anyway because I am color treated
obviously<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> protein<00:01:19.830> helps<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.340> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
obviously and protein helps a lot with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.260 
obviously and protein helps a lot with
breakage<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.520> general<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.240> make

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
breakage and just in general to make

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
breakage and just in general to make
your<00:01:24.479> hair<00:01:24.600> feel<00:01:24.750> better<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.790> yeah<00:01:26.790> that's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
your hair feel better so yeah that's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
your hair feel better so yeah that's
what<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.150> used<00:01:27.330> I'm<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.159> already<00:01:29.670> have

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what I used I'm going to I already have

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.380 
what I used I'm going to I already have
I<00:01:30.119> mix<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.750> already<00:01:31.439> earth<00:01:31.650> orchid<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.549> three

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
I mix the already earth orchid in three

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.039 
I mix the already earth orchid in three
separate<00:01:34.790> plates<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.810> different

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
separate plates and there's different

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749 
separate plates and there's different
tones<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.829> each<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
tones to each one so this one is a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.649 
tones to each one so this one is a
lighter<00:01:39.090> version<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> dark<00:01:42.390> one

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
lighter version this one is the dark one

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.039 
lighter version this one is the dark one
so<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> multi<00:01:45.119> tonal<00:01:45.329> purple

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so I have like a multi tonal purple

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
so I have like a multi tonal purple
