string part with it did you know that
bit

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
bit

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.460 
bit
you're<00:05:03.000> not<00:05:03.120> playing<00:05:03.330> every<00:05:03.570> single<00:05:03.600> note<00:05:04.260> but

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
you're not playing every single note but

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.870 
you're not playing every single note but
you're<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.830> putting<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.250> hint<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.640> it<00:05:05.760> in

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
you're just putting a hint of it in

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.840 
you're just putting a hint of it in
there<00:05:06.060> just<00:05:07.040> makes<00:05:08.040> it<00:05:08.130> sound<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.550> little<00:05:08.670> bit

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
there just makes it sound a little bit

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:26.050 
there just makes it sound a little bit
better<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.120> think<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.540> bit<00:05:09.750> more<00:05:09.900> interesting

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.960

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.000 

using<00:06:05.570> those<00:06:05.690> exact<00:06:06.020> same<00:06:06.050> notes<00:06:06.500> I<00:06:06.740> showed

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
using those exact same notes I showed

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.140 
using those exact same notes I showed
you<00:06:07.160> before<00:06:08.020> anyway<00:06:09.040> so<00:06:10.040> like<00:06:10.190> I<00:06:10.280> said<00:06:10.460> it's

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
you before anyway so like I said it's

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.970 
you before anyway so like I said it's
essentially<00:06:11.750> a<00:06:11.780> very<00:06:11.990> basic<00:06:12.230> song<00:06:12.650> but<00:06:12.860> you

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
essentially a very basic song but you

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.980 
essentially a very basic song but you
can<00:06:13.250> introduce<00:06:13.970> a<00:06:14.270> few<00:06:14.420> little<00:06:14.540> things<00:06:14.630> here

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
can introduce a few little things here

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.210 
can introduce a few little things here
and<00:06:15.020> there<00:06:15.170> just<00:06:15.470> to<00:06:15.560> make<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.710> little<00:06:15.980> bit<00:06:16.070> more

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
and there just to make a little bit more

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.070 
and there just to make a little bit more
exciting<00:06:16.640> it's<00:06:17.210> just<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.510> way<00:06:17.630> I<00:06:17.660> like<00:06:17.960> to

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
exciting it's just the way I like to

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.200 
exciting it's just the way I like to
plan<00:06:18.290> so<00:06:18.590> I<00:06:18.800> hope<00:06:19.280> you<00:06:19.430> like<00:06:19.580> it<00:06:19.610> to<00:06:20.200> see
