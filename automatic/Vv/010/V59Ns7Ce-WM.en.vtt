quicker<00:03:20.600> than<00:03:20.750> cricket<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.709> get<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> sort

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
quicker than cricket and we get a sort

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.160 
quicker than cricket and we get a sort
of<00:03:22.370> tea<00:03:22.549> break<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:23.000> between<00:03:23.090> doing<00:03:23.630> what<00:03:23.810> we<00:03:23.930> do

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
of tea break in between doing what we do

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.990 
of tea break in between doing what we do
but<00:03:24.410> i'm<00:03:24.620> no<00:03:25.160> it's<00:03:25.340> just<00:03:25.519> really<00:03:25.670> good<00:03:25.940> to

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
but i'm no it's just really good to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.640 
but i'm no it's just really good to
actually<00:03:26.239> play<00:03:26.660> with<00:03:26.840> some<00:03:27.019> proper<00:03:27.410> players

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
actually play with some proper players

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.560 
actually play with some proper players
and<00:03:27.920> see<00:03:28.100> what<00:03:28.250> it's<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.459> about<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:29.030> yeah

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
and see what it's all about and yeah

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.750 
and see what it's all about and yeah
it's<00:03:29.780> very<00:03:29.989> quick<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:30.620> hard<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.430> keep<00:03:31.580> up

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
it's very quick and just hard to keep up

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.220 
it's very quick and just hard to keep up
with<00:03:31.970> some<00:03:32.150> times<00:03:32.390> but<00:03:32.540> I've<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:33.200> enjoyed

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
with some times but I've really enjoyed

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900 
with some times but I've really enjoyed
it<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.190> course<00:03:34.220> one<00:03:34.580> of<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.760> big

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
it and of course one of the big

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.729 
it and of course one of the big
differences<00:03:35.170> you're<00:03:36.170> playing<00:03:36.350> with<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.590> boys

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
differences you're playing with the boys

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.199 
differences you're playing with the boys
on<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.250> time<00:03:37.519> what<00:03:37.670> was<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.940> light

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
on this time what was that light

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.870 
on this time what was that light
relative<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.959> day<00:03:39.110> job<00:03:39.410> well<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.340> she<00:03:40.610> stuff

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
relative to the day job well I she stuff

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.430 
relative to the day job well I she stuff
against<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.360> me<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.720> little<00:03:41.840> bit<00:03:42.019> physical

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
against to me it's a little bit physical

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.600 
against to me it's a little bit physical
but<00:03:42.560> he's<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:42.769> an<00:03:42.890> animal<00:03:42.980> player<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:43.489> I'll

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
but he's not an animal player so I'll

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.220 
but he's not an animal player so I'll
forgive<00:03:43.850> him<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.120> that<00:03:44.299> but<00:03:44.600> that's<00:03:45.049> really

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
forgive him on that but that's really

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.020 
forgive him on that but that's really
good<00:03:45.470> playing<00:03:45.680> with<00:03:45.799> guys<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.910> obviously

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
good playing with guys it obviously

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.390 
good playing with guys it obviously
raises<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.750> kind<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.019> competitiveness<00:03:48.980> and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
raises the kind of competitiveness and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.030 
raises the kind of competitiveness and
that<00:03:50.269> sort<00:03:50.540> of<00:03:50.600> thing<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.170> really<00:03:51.769> enjoyed

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
that sort of thing but I really enjoyed

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.400 
that sort of thing but I really enjoyed
it<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.580> turns<00:03:52.880> in<00:03:53.060> regular<00:03:53.570> netball<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.200> this

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
it so turns in regular netball to this

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.440 
it so turns in regular netball to this
what's<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.890> difference<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.549> was<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.180> saying

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
what's the difference I was just saying

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.759 
what's the difference I was just saying
I<00:03:56.510> was<00:03:56.630> actually<00:03:56.930> dying<00:03:57.200> out<00:03:57.440> there<00:03:57.470> cuz<00:03:57.709> you

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
I was actually dying out there cuz you

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.950 
I was actually dying out there cuz you
constantly<00:03:58.190> running<00:03:58.400> up<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.670> down

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
constantly running up and down

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.900 
constantly running up and down
no<00:03:59.080> stop<00:03:59.350> start<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.830> the<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.310> space<00:04:00.520> is<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> lot

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
no stop start it the the space is a lot

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.220 
no stop start it the the space is a lot
smaller<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.330> it's<00:04:01.540> nice<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.990> can<00:04:02.110> shoot

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
smaller and it's nice that you can shoot

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.480 
smaller and it's nice that you can shoot
outside<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.650> circle<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:03.040> well<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.400> is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
outside the circle as well so it is

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.760 
outside the circle as well so it is
although<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.240> general<00:04:04.840> game<00:04:05.020> is<00:04:05.260> pretty<00:04:05.590> much

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
although the general game is pretty much

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.680 
although the general game is pretty much
the<00:04:05.830> same<00:04:06.010> as<00:04:06.190> some<00:04:06.340> nice<00:04:06.460> differences<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
the same as some nice differences and

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.330 
the same as some nice differences and
what<00:04:07.870> would<00:04:07.990> you<00:04:08.110> say<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.350> anybody<00:04:08.830> thinking

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
what would you say to anybody thinking

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.700 
what would you say to anybody thinking
about<00:04:09.580> taking<00:04:09.910> up<00:04:10.210> netball<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:11.140> there's

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
about taking up netball because there's

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.950 
about taking up netball because there's
clearly<00:04:12.010> quite<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> big<00:04:12.580> movement<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.030> get<00:04:13.150> to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
clearly quite a big movement to get to

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.570 
clearly quite a big movement to get to
get<00:04:14.110> people<00:04:14.440> returning<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:15.160> play<00:04:15.340> netball

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
get people returning to play netball

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.250 
get people returning to play netball
with<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> England<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.360> netball<00:04:16.660> initiative

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
with the England to netball initiative

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.740 
with the England to netball initiative
what<00:04:18.160> part<00:04:18.400> can<00:04:18.580> into<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.060> netball<00:04:19.390> play<00:04:19.600> in

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
what part can into a netball play in

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.240 
what part can into a netball play in
that<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.110> think<00:04:20.440> it's<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.650> massive<00:04:20.980> fight<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
that I think it's a massive fight you

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.410 
that I think it's a massive fight you
know<00:04:21.340> anything<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.760> gets<00:04:21.910> people<00:04:22.300> together

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
know anything that gets people together

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.850 
know anything that gets people together
I<00:04:22.660> think<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.960> great<00:04:23.140> thing<00:04:23.170> about<00:04:23.350> netball<00:04:23.740> is

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
I think the great thing about netball is

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.260 
I think the great thing about netball is
it's<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.310> sure<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.760> think<00:04:24.940> that's<00:04:25.090> why<00:04:25.240> a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
it's so so sure and I think that's why a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.700 
it's so so sure and I think that's why a
lot<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.510> women<00:04:25.720> are<00:04:25.870> coming<00:04:26.110> back<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.350> play<00:04:26.470> I

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
lot of women are coming back to play I

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.750 
lot of women are coming back to play I
think<00:04:26.980> what's<00:04:27.130> great<00:04:27.250> here<00:04:27.460> is<00:04:27.550> you've<00:04:27.640> got

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
think what's great here is you've got

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.280 
think what's great here is you've got
the<00:04:27.850> guys<00:04:28.000> down<00:04:28.270> here<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.660> they<00:04:28.780> respect<00:04:29.170> the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
the guys down here and they respect the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.780 
the guys down here and they respect the
spot<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.250> that's<00:04:30.370> something<00:04:30.520> we're

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
spot and I think that's something we're

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.920 
spot and I think that's something we're
trying<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.090> move<00:04:31.180> away<00:04:31.210> from<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.660> normal

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
trying to move away from a normal

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.390 
trying to move away from a normal
network<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.230> it's<00:04:32.380> not<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.590> schoolgirl<00:04:33.070> sport

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
network that it's not a schoolgirl sport

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.590 
network that it's not a schoolgirl sport
