automotive industry and the electric

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.070 
automotive industry and the electric
vehicle<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.519> seen<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> there's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> natural

vehicle was seen as a there's a natural

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.870 
vehicle was seen as a there's a natural
progression<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:17.039> we<00:00:17.160> looked<00:00:17.340> at<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.520> number<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
progression so we looked at a number of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.910 
progression so we looked at a number of
different<00:00:18.600> projects<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.439> were<00:00:19.529> involved

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
different projects that we were involved

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
different projects that we were involved
with<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.400> decided<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:22.050> Indy

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
with and then decided on the the Indy

car mr. electric vehicle to enter for
the<00:00:24.240> competition<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> vehicle

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the competition because it's a vehicle

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.019 
the competition because it's a vehicle
that<00:00:25.980> we're<00:00:26.130> developing<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.730> production

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that we're developing from production

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.900 
that we're developing from production
anyhow<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.529> seemed<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> natural<00:00:29.160> fit<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
anyhow so it seemed a natural fit the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.209 
anyhow so it seemed a natural fit the
vehicle<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.660> four-seater<00:00:31.230> based<00:00:31.769> off<00:00:32.009> one

india the indica vista started off with
just<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.980> small<00:00:38.460> number<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> us<00:00:39.000> working<00:00:39.360> on

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
just a small number of us working on

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
just a small number of us working on
this<00:00:39.600> program<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> program's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this program and then as the program's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.490 
this program and then as the program's
evolve<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:42.149> been<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> great<00:00:42.540> opportunity<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
evolve it's been a great opportunity to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
evolve it's been a great opportunity to
understand<00:00:44.430> how<00:00:44.610> each<00:00:45.030> individual<00:00:45.570> member

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
understand how each individual member

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.709 
understand how each individual member
works<00:00:46.260> understand<00:00:46.980> their<00:00:47.100> dynamics<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.850> really

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
works understand their dynamics I really

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.319 
works understand their dynamics I really
try<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.649> get<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> best<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
try and get the best out of them and

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.350 
try and get the best out of them and
bringing<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:51.899> together<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> whole<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
bringing them together as a whole and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.819 
bringing them together as a whole and
that's<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.539> good<00:00:54.629> experience<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.680> been

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that's a good experience so it's been

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
that's a good experience so it's been
over<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.219> years<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.059> people

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
over two years so you get to know people

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.450 
over two years so you get to know people
very<00:00:57.539> well<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.559> Tata<00:00:58.770> Motors<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
very well I think for Tata Motors it's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.330 
very well I think for Tata Motors it's
it's<00:00:59.940> we've<00:01:00.719> demonstrated<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
it's we've demonstrated that we like to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.149 
it's we've demonstrated that we like to
do<00:01:02.489> things<00:01:02.670> differently<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> business<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
do things differently as a business and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.760 
do things differently as a business and
being<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> only<00:01:05.339> OEM<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> competition

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
being the only OEM in this competition

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.980 
being the only OEM in this competition
is<00:01:07.770> another<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.790> us<00:01:08.939> being<00:01:09.630> different

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
is another example of us being different

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
is another example of us being different
Oh<00:01:10.260> II<00:01:10.409> am<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:11.220> conscious<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.880> their

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Oh II am very conscious of their

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.050 
Oh II am very conscious of their
commitment<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> environment<00:01:14.060> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
commitment to the environment and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.440 
commitment to the environment and
reduction<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> co2<00:01:16.290> from<00:01:17.280> their<00:01:17.549> vehicles<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
reduction of co2 from their vehicles and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.510 
reduction of co2 from their vehicles and
obviously<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> consumers<00:01:19.310> requirement<00:01:20.310> for

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
obviously the consumers requirement for

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
obviously the consumers requirement for
a<00:01:20.759> fuel-efficient<00:01:21.570> clean<00:01:21.840> vehicle<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
a fuel-efficient clean vehicle as well a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
a fuel-efficient clean vehicle as well a
certain<00:01:23.729> level<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.450> expectation<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.350> there

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
certain level of expectation is there

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.700 
certain level of expectation is there
from<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> public<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.869> press<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.380> our

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
from the public and the press in our

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.899 
from the public and the press in our
performance<00:01:29.509> but<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.600> helped<00:01:31.049> us<00:01:31.200> focus<00:01:31.909> our

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
performance but I helped us focus our

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.880 
performance but I helped us focus our
even<00:01:33.329> harder<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> project<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.590> ensure

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
even harder on the project to ensure

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
even harder on the project to ensure
that<00:01:34.920> we're<00:01:35.610> successful<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.630> believe<00:01:36.930> we've

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
