00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
there's so many different reasons why a

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.730 
there's so many different reasons why a
high<00:03:27.100> financial<00:03:27.580> IQ<00:03:28.170> part<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.380> your<00:03:29.530> learning

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
high financial IQ part of your learning

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.890

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
if you are the old thinking you might

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.690 
if you are the old thinking you might
think<00:03:34.540> all<00:03:34.750> debt<00:03:35.110> is<00:03:35.320> bad<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.490> not

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
think all debt is bad that is not

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.290 
think all debt is bad that is not
correct

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
correct

there's<00:03:40.570> one<00:03:40.750> more<00:03:40.930> thing<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.290> think<00:03:41.500> that's

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
there's one more thing I think that's

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.920 
there's one more thing I think that's
really<00:03:41.890> important<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.760> know<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.480> said<00:03:43.780> earlier

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
really important you know I said earlier

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.950 
really important you know I said earlier
that<00:03:44.200> savers<00:03:44.800> were<00:03:44.950> losers<00:03:45.460> I<00:03:45.720> believe<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> I

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
that savers were losers I believe and I

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.590 
that savers were losers I believe and I
could<00:03:47.200> be<00:03:47.350> wrong<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> near<00:03:49.120> future

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
could be wrong that in the near future

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.860 
could be wrong that in the near future
the<00:03:50.140> debtors<00:03:50.590> will<00:03:51.010> be<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.250> winners<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the debtors will be the winners and the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.350 
the debtors will be the winners and the
reason<00:03:52.870> for<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.110> is<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:54.430> example<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.120> just

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
reason for that is for example I just

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.990 
reason for that is for example I just
bought<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.870> an<00:03:56.800> apartment<00:03:57.370> house<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:57.850> let's

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
bought a an apartment house and let's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.150 
bought a an apartment house and let's
say<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> paid<00:03:58.420> 20<00:03:58.810> million<00:03:59.140> dollars<00:03:59.560> for<00:03:59.860> it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
say I paid 20 million dollars for it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.310 
say I paid 20 million dollars for it
and<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.330> twenty<00:04:01.720> eight<00:04:01.810> million<00:04:02.080> dollar

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
and I have a twenty eight million dollar

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.140 
and I have a twenty eight million dollar
mortgage<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.270> well<00:04:04.440> if<00:04:05.440> they<00:04:05.740> keep

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
mortgage on it well if they keep

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.310 
mortgage on it well if they keep
devaluing<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.360> dollar<00:04:07.630> I'm<00:04:07.960> going<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.230> be

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
devaluing the dollar I'm going to be

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.140 
devaluing the dollar I'm going to be
paying<00:04:08.650> that<00:04:08.920> twenty<00:04:09.220> million<00:04:09.400> dollars<00:04:09.940> off

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
paying that twenty million dollars off

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.900 
paying that twenty million dollars off
with<00:04:10.890> dollars<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:12.040> are<00:04:12.160> worth<00:04:12.340> less<00:04:12.640> and

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
capital gains or appreciation I base all

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.080 
capital gains or appreciation I base all
of<00:06:09.990> my<00:06:10.260> investments<00:06:10.890> on<00:06:11.010> cashflow<00:06:11.669> how<00:06:11.910> much

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
money comes in so even though the real

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.700 
money comes in so even though the real
estate<00:06:14.790> market<00:06:15.210> has<00:06:15.300> crashed<00:06:15.660> I<00:06:16.050> hate<00:06:16.380> to<00:06:16.530> say

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
this but it look good it's been good for

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.480 
this but it look good it's been good for
me<00:06:18.870> because<00:06:19.050> more<00:06:19.500> people<00:06:19.770> became<00:06:20.070> renters

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
me because more people became renters

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.880 
me because more people became renters
all<00:06:20.700> of<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.910> sudden<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.810> my<00:06:21.990> rental<00:06:22.380> rates<00:06:22.620> went

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
all of a sudden so my rental rates went

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.430 
all of a sudden so my rental rates went
up<00:06:23.010> my<00:06:23.340> income<00:06:23.700> went<00:06:23.850> out<00:06:24.060> I'm<00:06:24.300> paying<00:06:25.020> for<00:06:25.350> it

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
with cheap dollars and things like this

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.380 
with cheap dollars and things like this
so<00:06:27.750> in<00:06:27.990> the<00:06:28.680> new<00:06:28.860> rules<00:06:29.100> of<00:06:29.280> money<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:30.000> have<00:06:30.210> to

know difference between good debt and
bad<00:06:32.220> debt<00:06:32.430> and<00:06:32.940> why<00:06:33.660> savers<00:06:34.260> are<00:06:34.470> losers<00:06:34.890> and
