a mirror you shine that mirror on that
solar<00:02:13.459> panel<00:02:14.060> let's<00:02:14.420> see<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.720> I<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.989> get<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
solar panel let's see if I can get this

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:23.080 
solar panel let's see if I can get this
done<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:17.000> look<00:02:17.180> over<00:02:17.510> here<00:02:18.020> ah<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.910> hard

to do okay hold on let me try something

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.190 
to do okay hold on let me try something
different<00:02:35.260> okay<00:02:36.489> there<00:02:37.489> we<00:02:37.580> go

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
different okay there we go

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.780 
different okay there we go
twenty<00:02:39.200> volts<00:02:39.350> now<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.250> take<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.459> mirror

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
twenty volts now if you take a mirror

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.820 
twenty volts now if you take a mirror
shine<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:42.290> mirror<00:02:42.620> at<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.860> solar<00:02:43.190> panel

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
shine that mirror at the solar panel

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.250 
shine that mirror at the solar panel
that's<00:02:45.830> twenty<00:02:46.220> point<00:02:46.519> five<00:02:50.019> twenty<00:02:51.019> point

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that's twenty point five twenty point

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.370 
that's twenty point five twenty point
four<00:02:51.850> all<00:02:52.850> right<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.060> while<00:02:53.360> ago<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.720> was<00:02:54.080> able<00:02:54.230> to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
four all right a while ago I was able to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.680 
four all right a while ago I was able to
get<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.709> jump<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.310> twenty<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:55.910> point

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
get it to jump up to twenty one point

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.650 
get it to jump up to twenty one point
for<00:02:58.060> my<00:02:59.060> angle<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.510> not<00:02:59.720> real<00:03:00.110> good<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:02.420> just

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
for my angle is not real good that just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.630 
for my angle is not real good that just
show<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:03.790> that's<00:03:04.790> at<00:03:05.090> twenty

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
show you so that's that's at twenty

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.370 
show you so that's that's at twenty
that's<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.850> twenty<00:03:08.180> point<00:03:08.390> four<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.110> if<00:03:09.200> you

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's a twenty point four so if you

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.539 
that's a twenty point four so if you
were<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.590> focus<00:03:09.890> more<00:03:10.959> mirrors<00:03:11.959> on<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.370> one

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
were to focus more mirrors on the one

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.090 
were to focus more mirrors on the one
solar<00:03:13.880> panel<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.500> get<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.829> thing<00:03:16.040> to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
solar panel you can get that thing to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.289 
solar panel you can get that thing to
jump<00:03:16.489> up<00:03:17.680> quite<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.709> bit<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.910> gonna<00:03:23.090> try

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
jump up quite a bit I'm gonna try

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.950 
jump up quite a bit I'm gonna try
something<00:03:23.600> different<00:03:24.019> make<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> video<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.769> it
