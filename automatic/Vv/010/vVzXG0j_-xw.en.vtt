go to the controller options of this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
go to the controller options of this
game<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.390> don't<00:00:48.450> find<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.930> fucking<00:00:49.289> steering

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
game and I don't find a fucking steering

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
game and I don't find a fucking steering
wheel<00:00:49.829> option<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.210> guys

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
wheel option that's right guys

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990

and then I don't find the same with

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.540 
and then I don't find the same with
option<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.360> ever<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.629> find<00:00:55.020> an<00:00:55.250> Xbox<00:00:56.250> 360

that<00:02:03.180> let<00:02:03.299> me<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.659> put<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> full<00:02:04.170> stop<00:02:04.409> there

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that let me just put the full stop there

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.160 
that let me just put the full stop there

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
driven in off-road I've done a lot of

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.910 
driven in off-road I've done a lot of
off-road<00:03:57.150> stuff<00:03:57.450> in<00:03:57.599> or<00:03:57.870> motor<00:03:58.349> crossing<00:03:58.769> and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
I've also driven and off water so I kind

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.369 
I've also driven and off water so I kind
of<00:04:02.459> get<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.610> bit<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.849> an<00:04:02.939> idea<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.750> how<00:04:03.959> things

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
of get a bit of an idea of how things

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.449 
of get a bit of an idea of how things
like<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.769> feel<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.420> yeah<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.629> does<00:04:06.930> handle

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
like this feel and yeah it does handle

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.610 
like this feel and yeah it does handle
particularly<00:04:08.459> realistic<00:04:09.030> which<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.720> which<00:04:10.470> is

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
particularly realistic which is which is

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.830 
particularly realistic which is which is
really<00:04:10.860> really<00:04:10.980> good<00:04:11.220> fun<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.819> had<00:04:12.420> great<00:04:12.659> fun

really really good fun I had great fun

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.039 
really really good fun I had great fun
on<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.920> really<00:04:14.189> did<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:15.030> was<00:04:15.510> pissed

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
on this I really really did I was pissed

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.420 
on this I really really did I was pissed
off<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.560> using<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.889> keyboard<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.400> mouse

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
off that I was using a keyboard a mouse

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729 
off that I was using a keyboard a mouse
which<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.870> best<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.380> camera

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
which is not the best and the camera

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.979 
which is not the best and the camera
angles<00:04:20.070> are<00:04:20.190> awful<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:21.090> just<00:04:21.359> front<00:04:21.660> or<00:04:21.780> back

foreigners pretty much immediately

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.450 
foreigners pretty much immediately
because<00:04:52.319> I<00:04:52.349> hadn't<00:04:52.650> locked<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.979> diff<00:04:53.160> on<00:04:53.310> all

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
because I hadn't locked the diff on all

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.990 
because I hadn't locked the diff on all
wheels<00:04:53.840> but<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.050> had<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.530> great<00:04:55.919> laugh<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.789> this

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
wheels but I had a great laugh in this

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.110 
wheels but I had a great laugh in this
game<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.599> is<00:04:57.660> fun<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.830> really<00:04:59.550> really<00:04:59.789> is<00:04:59.910> fun

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
game it is fun it really really is fun

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.499 
game it is fun it really really is fun
however<00:05:00.870> it's<00:05:01.349> 20<00:05:01.979> pounds<00:05:02.220> guys<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.150> think

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
however it's 20 pounds guys and I think

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.540 
however it's 20 pounds guys and I think
that's<00:05:03.720> just<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.169> little<00:05:04.199> bit<00:05:04.650> too<00:05:05.009> much<00:05:05.190> there

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
that's just a little bit too much there

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
that's just a little bit too much there
are<00:05:05.699> adding<00:05:06.120> wheel<00:05:06.330> support<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.990> it<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.199> do<00:05:07.259> know

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
are adding wheel support to it I do know

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.980 
are adding wheel support to it I do know
that<00:05:07.800> for<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.070> fact<00:05:08.130> it's<00:05:08.880> coming<00:05:09.389> in<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:09.630> next

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
that for a fact it's coming in the next

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.029 
that for a fact it's coming in the next
hook<00:05:10.139> did<00:05:10.380> so<00:05:10.500> I'm<00:05:10.590> going<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.830> give<00:05:10.949> the

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
hook did so I'm going to give the

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.650 
hook did so I'm going to give the
developers<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.610> benefit<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.240> doubt<00:05:12.270> with

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
developers the benefit of the doubt with

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.710 
developers the benefit of the doubt with
the<00:05:12.919> wheel<00:05:13.919> support<00:05:14.400> but<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.789> still<00:05:15.120> think<00:05:15.419> even

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
the wheel support but I still think even

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.779 
the wheel support but I still think even
if<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.930> had<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.110> wheel<00:05:16.409> support<00:05:16.860> 20<00:05:17.310> pounds<00:05:17.699> is

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
if it had the wheel support 20 pounds is

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.879 
if it had the wheel support 20 pounds is
a<00:05:17.820> big<00:05:17.909> ask<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> game<00:05:19.349> with<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.740> little

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
a big ask for a game with so little

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.629 
a big ask for a game with so little
content<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.990> don't<00:05:22.919> get<00:05:23.069> us<00:05:23.190> wrong<00:05:23.220> it's<00:05:23.550> a

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
content so don't get us wrong it's a

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.790 
content so don't get us wrong it's a
great<00:05:23.970> game<00:05:24.300> it's<00:05:24.539> a<00:05:24.630> fun<00:05:24.960> game<00:05:25.199> but<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.530> just

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
great game it's a fun game but I just

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.310 
great game it's a fun game but I just
don't<00:05:26.069> think<00:05:26.370> it's<00:05:26.490> worth<00:05:26.639> 20<00:05:27.060> pounds<00:05:27.419> but

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
don't think it's worth 20 pounds but

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.200 
don't think it's worth 20 pounds but
what<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:28.590> will<00:05:28.830> say<00:05:29.099> is<00:05:29.130> if<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.550> see<00:05:29.849> this<00:05:30.030> in

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
what I will say is if you see this in

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.969 
what I will say is if you see this in
the<00:05:30.300> seals<00:05:30.570> it<00:05:30.840> is<00:05:30.990> definitely<00:05:31.740> definitely

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
the seals it is definitely definitely
