to be here that's going to be another

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.000 
to be here that's going to be another
glitch<00:00:26.430> lee<00:00:26.699> i<00:00:27.140> didn't<00:00:28.140> i<00:00:28.320> didn't<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> I'm

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
glitch lee i didn't i didn't know it I'm

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.690 
glitch lee i didn't i didn't know it I'm
dumped<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.490> but

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:48.110 

let's<00:00:36.210> try<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.570> again<00:00:46.700> that<00:00:47.700> should<00:00:47.970> do<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
let's try this again that should do the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
let's try this again that should do the
trick<00:00:53.480> yeah<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:56.120> obviously<00:00:57.170> can<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:59.090> I've

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
trick yeah so obviously can see I've

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750 
trick yeah so obviously can see I've
already<00:01:00.360> escaped<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> forest<00:01:01.350> before<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.430> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
already escaped the forest before but on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
already escaped the forest before but on
this<00:01:03.510> trick<00:01:03.809> still<00:01:04.080> works<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:07.020> save<00:01:07.229> time

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
this trick still works for to save time

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.640 
this trick still works for to save time

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
stabbed so you just press the hour

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.220 
stabbed so you just press the hour
button<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.209> you're<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.480> n64<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.440> GC<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:15.840> do

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
button if you're on n64 or GC and you do

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.640 
button if you're on n64 or GC and you do
that<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.850> so<00:02:17.850> when<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.360> hit<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.900> recoil

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that and so when you hit it you recoil

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.710 
that and so when you hit it you recoil
off<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.190> wall<00:02:20.370> I'll<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.270> recoil<00:02:23.720> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
off the wall I'll see that recoil so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.110 
off the wall I'll see that recoil so
what<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:25.020> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.430> recoil<00:02:26.880> we

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
what we want to do is when we recoil we

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.300 
what we want to do is when we recoil we
want<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.420> interrupt<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.900> recoil<00:02:28.349> by<00:02:29.010> talking

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
want to interrupt that recoil by talking

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.190 
want to interrupt that recoil by talking
to<00:02:29.700> him<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:31.790> you'll<00:02:32.790> clip<00:02:33.090> through<00:02:33.420> him<00:02:33.690> so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
learn so as the cutscene goes you can

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.450 
learn so as the cutscene goes you can
see<00:05:00.610> link<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.090> backing<00:05:01.660> out<00:05:01.930> of<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.170> forest<00:05:02.560> so

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
see link is backing out of the forest so

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.390 
see link is backing out of the forest so
he's<00:05:03.640> kind<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:03.940> sad<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:06.250> know<00:05:08.220> because<00:05:09.220> she

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400

doesn't know if he's gonna save the
world<00:05:11.760> maybe<00:05:12.760> die<00:05:13.710> chances<00:05:14.710> are<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.010> will

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
world maybe die chances are you will

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.070 
world maybe die chances are you will
probably<00:05:15.460> die<00:05:15.730> on<00:05:15.970> plenty<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.570> ocarina<00:05:17.020> of

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
probably die on plenty of ocarina of

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.650 
probably die on plenty of ocarina of
time<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:18.460> even<00:05:18.700> though<00:05:18.820> I've<00:05:18.940> been<00:05:18.970> in<00:05:19.270> Hyrule

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
time but even though I've been in Hyrule

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.350 
time but even though I've been in Hyrule
