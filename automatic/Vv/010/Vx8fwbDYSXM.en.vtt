00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
believe that all of that is derived from

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.500 
believe that all of that is derived from
decades<00:00:57.390> decades<00:00:57.930> ago<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:59.090> people<00:01:00.090> didn't

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
didn't quite understand us needed a way

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.190 
didn't quite understand us needed a way
to<00:01:37.939> better<00:01:38.939> understand<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:40.170> our

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to better understand what our

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
to better understand what our
relationship<00:01:40.860> roles<00:01:41.640> were<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.340> they<00:01:44.340> asked

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
relationship roles were so they asked

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
relationship roles were so they asked
well<00:01:45.240> who<00:01:45.570> wears<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> pants<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> family

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
well who wears the pants in the family

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
well who wears the pants in the family
and<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.750> been

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and I think that that has just been

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.530 
and I think that that has just been
carried<00:01:49.350> over<00:01:49.500> from<00:01:49.680> from<00:01:50.549> those<00:01:50.759> generations

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
carried over from from those generations

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620 
carried over from from those generations
and<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.560> from<00:01:53.130> those<00:01:53.310> times<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.180> people

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and from from those times and people

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.819 
and from from those times and people
still<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.909> yes<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.829> offensive

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
still want to know yes it is offensive

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.899 
still want to know yes it is offensive
because<00:01:59.780> we<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:01.200> trying<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.369> pull<00:02:02.729> ourselves

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
because we are trying to pull ourselves
