00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
because otherwise the ads will come join

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
because otherwise the ads will come join
the<00:00:43.860> fight<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.219> making<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.760> make<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> bit

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the fight and making it it make it a bit

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.959 
the fight and making it it make it a bit
more<00:00:45.989> difficult<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.219> anyways<00:00:47.489> south<00:00:47.730> area

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
more difficult but anyways south area

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.880 
more difficult but anyways south area
and<00:00:48.149> himself<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.690> actually<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.110> easy<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and himself is actually very easy to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.889 
and himself is actually very easy to
solo<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.180> other<00:00:51.329> Drake's<00:00:51.660> join

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
solo it is when the other Drake's join

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
solo it is when the other Drake's join
the<00:00:52.050> fight<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.500> becomes<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.219> more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the fight that it becomes a bit more

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.670 
the fight that it becomes a bit more
difficult<00:00:53.579> as<00:00:54.000> well<00:00:54.210> as<00:00:54.390> impossible<00:00:55.079> after

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
difficult as well as impossible after

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
difficult as well as impossible after
about<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.070> minutes<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.579> boss<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:57.000> become

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
about two minutes the boss does become

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
about two minutes the boss does become
unkillable<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.410> after<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.160> you're

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
unkillable so after that you're

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.220 
unkillable so after that you're
basically<00:00:59.820> screwed<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> start<00:01:01.050> over

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
basically screwed and have to start over

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
basically screwed and have to start over
but<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> good<00:01:02.760> amount<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> DPS<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
but if you have a good amount of DPS you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
but if you have a good amount of DPS you
can<00:01:03.840> easily<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.650> down<00:01:04.830> two<00:01:05.100> minutes<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
can easily get it down two minutes is a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190 
can easily get it down two minutes is a
lot<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.900> about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
lot of time when you really think about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.539 
lot of time when you really think about
it<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> even<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> fairly<00:01:09.450> bad<00:01:09.960> geared

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
it and even as a fairly bad geared

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.550 
it and even as a fairly bad geared
warrior<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.909> point<00:01:12.210> 493<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.990> believe<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
warrior at this point 493 I believe I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
warrior at this point 493 I believe I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
characters because each character does

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.520 
characters because each character does
have<00:02:15.549> its<00:02:15.760> separate<00:02:16.390> lockout<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.349> raid
