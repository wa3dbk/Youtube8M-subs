00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:09.320
 many think that it is the reflection of the sea 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:13.610
 but it's the other way around the sea turns blue 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.520
 by the sky the composition of its gases 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.920
 especially the ozone layer do that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.650
 solar energy when we get to our 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.810
 atmosphere this becomes a kind of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.320
 filter that allows the passage of all 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.520
 spectra minus the ultraviolet that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.850
 literally reflected like a mirror 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.180
 this spectrum in its visible part is the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.670
 color that we know as blue now in 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.070
 the night as the intensity of the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.560
 sunlight we can see that it 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.280
 it turns a violet color as it 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.969
 the sky darkens 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.360
 others say that the sky is not blue nor 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.699
 of no color there is no sky what 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.550
 we really see is the color of space 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.010
 attenuated by sunlight is why 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.860
 that at night we see it dark because 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 there is light and by day we see it clearly because 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.710
 there is light this is pure logic 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.840
 but the color of the sky is due to three 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.079
 factors 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.979
 to the composition of light to the 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.200
 atmosphere and our physiology the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.020
 developed color theory 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.299
 initially by Newton explains that the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.909
 white light is formed by the sum of 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.369
 all the colors of the rainbow and that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.399
 when we see an object of a color is 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.240
 because it reflects a certain wavelength and 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.350
 absorbs the rest or what is the same 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.979
 reflects that color 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.140
 while absorbing others at one extreme 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.869
 of the visible spectrum is the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.020
 red whose wavelength is the most 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.979
 long and therefore its frequency the most 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.610
 low that's why it's called infrared to 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.640
 the longer wavelengths and in 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.429
 the other end the violet whose length 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 wave is the shortest and therefore its 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 frequency the highest that's why you're 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.380
 ultraviolet flame to the lengths of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.930
 shorter wave 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.240
 the sunlight has to cross the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.790
 atmosphere to reach us and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.830
 although the pure air is colorless 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.280
 all wavelengths what 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.860
 they go through the tiny particles of 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.110
 dust and water in suspension more 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.240
 smaller than the wavelengths of 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.160
 visible light do not have size 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.680
 enough to repel the wave and 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.080
 they only slightly divert it from their 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:48.800
 original path over and over and over again is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.900
 what is known as dispersion occurs 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.080
 that the end wavelengths 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.660
 blue of the spectrum to be shorter are 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.030
 dispersed to a greater extent than those of 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.310
 rest of colors what confers 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.330
 objectively a violet blue color to 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.150
 Our sky 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.970
 but it turns out that our eyes capture the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.250
 color in its own way or rather our 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.440
 brain interprets the frequency of 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.480
 waves according to the information received 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.590
 through your eyes and your particular 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 physiology for it our eyes possess 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.390
 some cones sensitive to only three colors 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.150
 red green and blue 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.990
 the rest of colors excites several types 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.060
 of cones at a time or what is the same 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.250
 we can get the rest of colors to 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.310
 From the combination of these three 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.280
 and as our view is more sensitive to 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.890
 blue color that violet is this the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.460
 color that we observe when contemplating the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.460
 I hope this simple information and 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.590
 simplified has been helpful and you 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.740
 have liked the video or have you 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.520
 entertaining a bit is a great subject 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.510
 give thumb up to the video and subscribe 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.140
 thank you very much to see 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.140
 I'm Suriel and we'll see each other until next time
