lemon in half or if you guys don't feel
like<00:00:28.500> you're<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> use<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> all<00:00:29.279> then

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
like you're going to use it all then

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.479 
like you're going to use it all then
only<00:00:29.730> cut<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.510> few<00:00:30.599> slices<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
only cut it into a few slices so the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
only cut it into a few slices so the
only<00:00:32.610> reason<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> decided<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.719> cut<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
only reason why I decided to cut up the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
only reason why I decided to cut up the
lemon<00:00:34.380> into<00:00:34.620> three<00:00:35.040> slices<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
lemon into three slices was because I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.729 
lemon into three slices was because I
felt<00:00:36.180> like<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> middle<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.989> most<00:00:37.410> juice

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
felt like the middle has the most juice

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.080 
felt like the middle has the most juice
and<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.100> probably<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> biggest<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and it was probably the biggest for my

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
and it was probably the biggest for my
hand<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.450> hold<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.559> scrub<00:00:40.800> around<00:00:40.890> my

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
hand to hold and just to scrub around my

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
hand to hold and just to scrub around my
face<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> guys<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.090> use<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> top<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
face but you guys can use the top the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.069 
face but you guys can use the top the
second<00:00:43.260> slice<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.129> doesn't<00:00:44.460> matter<00:00:45.079> so

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
second slice it really doesn't matter so

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810
