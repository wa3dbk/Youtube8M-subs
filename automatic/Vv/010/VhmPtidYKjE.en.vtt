00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
finished product and I say kind of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.770 
finished product and I say kind of
because<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.850> lazy<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.390> side<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.690> only

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
because I was lazy on this side and only

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
because I was lazy on this side and only
did<00:00:40.020> three<00:00:40.200> cornrows<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.309> why<00:00:41.580> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
did three cornrows so that's why it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.390
