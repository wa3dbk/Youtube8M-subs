00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.790
 Good day to all viewers 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.279
 of my channel today we have a review on from 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.349
 his kurt well 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.660
 would like to remind you not to 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.419
 forgot to visit the wonderful site 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.210
 By this point and also by joining my 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.090
 VKontakte group link to the website 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.190
 the group is in the description in general 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.350
 This is the first review on the product goalkeeper and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.109
 do she didn't do a review on 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.050
 gates and generally so let's 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.120
 let's see what happened 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.879
 this goalkeeper impressed me also 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.730
 his usual card should 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.210
 admit that I did not play it is not black 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.329
 not 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.600
 Iman's card for the match was played only here 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.239
 blue and usually 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.019
 the difference is still there but as the blue attacks 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.659
 regular card they are very cool to me 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.290
 they liked it very much 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:15.280
 almost unbelievable good swords 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:19.630
 saves he is tall long-handed practically 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.980
 from at the very corner it tugs the ball and also 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.510
 quite good placement reflexes 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.470
 here at the penalty area its position 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:36.160
 speed throw in his couch and i 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.120
 I missed Well in general that I missed 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.590
 Iâ€™m pretty much not going to hide it but 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.830
 I miss a lot I always whatever 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.990
 the goalkeeper didn't stand there 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.290
 a large number of sword depended on even 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.690
 not from the goalkeeper the only two swords 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 which I missed there were 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.400
 claims 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.660
 exactly culture attack the rest talk 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.300
 all ashley is not doing it in general 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.940
 conclusions i would like to say that he is not 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.850
 very expensive and I think it is well worth it 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.640
 your money but you can buy it 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.080
 card mana dunk from the team 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.350
 week I think these cards 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.170
 also bad for me but someone wrote me that 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.470
 a card on a purse but worse than his 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.680
 ordinary card I do not know myself I will not 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.020
 believe and check you yourself 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.530
 I would also like to note that in 15 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.120
 maybe even a little more matches he 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.160
 missed only one moron goal 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:45.190
 which now you are watching let's 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.209
 go further with regard to assessing by 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.230
 a ten-point scale I'll be alma 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.470
 8 and 9 even 9 would give him very much 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.780
 cool goalkeeper so his score is 9 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.519
 points certainly here to dozens 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.700
 slightly below 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.620
 on this principle, thank you all for your attention 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.420
