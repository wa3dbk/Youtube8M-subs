00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.320
 was short video with video announcement 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.810
 the epic battles you pretty much 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.460
 expected soon on this channel and indeed 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.720
 so you have to go through all the keyboard 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 and i'm actually big in reallife 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:46.120

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.160
 pretty good friends but we know 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.920

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.510
 at gamescom has a special one 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.800
 Event that is suitable but that I do not 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.420
 but would like to talk but it was definitely 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.730
 very embarrassing for me and my pride 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.980
 that's why I have them offended 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.720
 challenged at a kind gtk 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.750
 to join olympics 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.119
 Anyone wondering what has the boy now 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.550
 already in his whistle purely done 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.410
 What does he need ? Everything is pretty 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.200
 cool you will understand that now 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.820
 actually damn funny it will be you 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.009
 definitely liked it and did 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.950
 we have a challenge we will be in 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.869
 beat three games and see who the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.039
 Best gamer is the three games and 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.050
 starcraft 2 warcraft 3 and counter 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.069
 strike 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.929
 however, it's not just that 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.819
 We are simply in the games are best 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.009
 of five beat and you get something 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.500
 others but it will settle with excel 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.840
 give in starcraft and warcraft are 3 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.080
 The rules are the first game 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.989
 Stinknormal so we play so well 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.069
 as we can then at the second game 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.179
 something on the second map 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.920
 who is the winner of that must with 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.590
 a handicap game and though 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 someone with a web leads then he has to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.310
 play with a race of the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.539
 Loser picks if someone with two 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.090
 maps then he must additionally without 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.970
 Keyboard only play with mouse if one 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.970
 with three maps leads then he must 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.040
 additionally in addition to that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.610
 he with of race play in addition to it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.739
 that he still plays that tour by 50% 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.080
 We play handicap because of that 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.460
 because we are not classic best of 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.330
 make five but we just play 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.640
 50 no matter how that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.780
 hunt he is himself at a 3 0 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.470
 we still have the fourth and fifth 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.600
 playing mac in this sense will that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.250
 whole warcraft 3 is what we are 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.770
 both even worse starcraft 2 and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 that will be damn funny and 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.920
 we could also think of what to strike 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.810
 nice because he probably because my 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.460
 but it does not matter, I hope 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.840
 you will like it all if it is 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.400
 Well , we do the whole thing too 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.440
 still in dota and to an old school 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.530
 threatened in the warcraft 3 decided 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.760
 the important threatened if we do so 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 and maybe the many many others 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.150
 games with the super smash bros rollator 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.740
 water gives no idea 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.030
 In any case, the one idea was me 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.640
 had and I hope they come good 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.990
 we want to make videos on sunday 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.000
 that means we will probably be in 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.180
 Runs up next week 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.470
 please support us and look 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.790
 you the videos of what you say it 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.620
 Hold on to the idea I think 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.510
 Personally pretty cool should also 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.640
 we will become interesting 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.140
 record what trash talk for both 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.540
 Give up each other that means we will 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.400
 while we only play the audio file 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.930
 and in retrospect I will 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.090
 then the replays price tag on his 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.010
 blog on three just as freeplay 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.550
 our two stories but see the 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.769
 audio file like the original stay where 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.200
 we insult this and the mothers 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.730
 from both of us with strange things 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.860
 Denote there are cool in any case 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.540

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.269

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.440
