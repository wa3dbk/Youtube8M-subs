 mugs without glitches and carbines that is 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.739
 At once 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.250
 put on a nylon thread or a fishing line 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.930
 and on the other hand tee 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.530
 or double also offer your 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530
 attention 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:26.830
 nichrome wire lead many 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.090
 anglers who love to catch live bait 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.170
 the last time goes exactly to 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 Nichrome its main advantage is 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:42.220
 that he is very soft his pike lives him easily 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 while the steel leash 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.660
 pretty hard but nichrome 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.630
 the leash has its flaw in it 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:02:02.900
 small load on the gap that is 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:06.500
 about five kilograms holds but not 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.200
 only soft but still stretches that is 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.300
 pike can not constantly offer 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 load there in 5 kilograms he break 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.430
 pike is quite difficult leash because 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.530
 everything and stretches here so it is easy to chew 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.700
 she can't eat 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.440
 can only survive as he wants that is 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 he is really very very soft 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.950
 but she won't be able to eat him either 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.040
 this lead according to your desire can 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.040
