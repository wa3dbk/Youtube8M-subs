game that I haven't played before I'll
start<00:01:43.670> with<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.790> small<00:01:44.090> bat<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:44.480> that<00:01:44.600> I<00:01:44.630> can

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
start with a small bat so that I can

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.140

disappears if I man it's three
consecutive<00:02:38.440> cascades<00:02:39.220> I'll<00:02:39.520> win<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.210> value

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
consecutive cascades I'll win the value

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.700 
consecutive cascades I'll win the value
of<00:02:40.660> all<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.930> columns<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.290> second
