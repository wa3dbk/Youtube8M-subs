00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.330
 hello welcome to my channel today we are not going 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 to wash the hair this hair name 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 the wash in three days that's why you see more 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 large and with much more volume and the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 truth is that I like it because the hair 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.730
 mine tends to be a little thinner and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 a little less a year ago that I'm 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.040
 using the curly hair method but 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.440
 the iccrom what it means is that I 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.590
 I do not use shampoos that have sulfates on 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.450
 sulfate is a detergent itself equal to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 that detergent that we use to wash the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.210
 dishes and pots the cauldrons that's why 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.949
 it makes so many lather and we want 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 that does not foam so that the hair 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 look clean not the truth is not 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 necessary to have all this foam on 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 Sulfate dries the hair and I do not 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.770
 I want my hair to dry because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.960
 curly in itself is dry I want 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.360
 use something that deserves that hair no more 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.360
 believe why it's good to buy shampoo 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.189
 that do not have sulfates I use cream 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.380
 cleaner for my hair that are 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.659
 special creams that do not have sulfates 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 that are specific to clean the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 Curly hair use shampoo that does not have 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.119
 sulfate or use conditioners that you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.670
 they call or huaying if the conditioner of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.950
 tea can clean the hair make sure 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.159
 of massaging the leather quite 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.740
 vigorously to remove dirty makes a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.720
 year I'm using these techniques and if 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.929

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.720

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.819
 lately I am developing the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.830
 hair with your fingers which is more 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.110
 easy from what I thought and as 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.959
 I always dry my hair with a sweater 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.230

 I bought it a year ago but I did not 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.100
 it worked because I was in the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.410
 transition process then me 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.440
 it left the hair super greasy and not very 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.690
 nice I used it once and I saved it but 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.000
 my curly hair because it leaves me well 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.400
 defined but that they only use one 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.040
 little bit of this product basically 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.170
 touching the product with the little fingers like that 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.680
