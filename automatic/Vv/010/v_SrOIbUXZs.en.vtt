00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.550
 who sent this was the cheer of Belo Horizonte beautiful horizon 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.240
 if when Jesus comes back people will be judged according to their knowledge and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.409
 Lifestyle 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.289
 how people with mental disabilities will be judged 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.390
 we have seen there the staff has attended 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.520
 one of the problems of a television network presenting a person with 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.999
 mental issue 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.520
 and we have noticed that many questions 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.090
 about this subject 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.199
 have arrived here 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.669
 in the program in the sights of truth 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.199
 this is the question per person if when I return to people will be judged 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.680
 according to their knowledge and lifestyle 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 how will they be judged? 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 people with intellectual disabilities 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 I'll do the quote with the viewer. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.470
 when searching for days 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.230
 that speaks of the new earth 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.630
 that I affirm next 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.580
 what 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
 do not face the road 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.540
 What does this text mean? 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 the list mentioning that the sky the best in the new land of first not be 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 then new land there will be people who one day 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.910
 had mental problems 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.380
 then you have no doubt that God will save these people. 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 because 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 we do not know if that person does not have it sometime 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.980
 of small with assists in the year a small fraction of a second 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.810
 hence her 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.100
 believe in God 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 in some way with another 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.180
 to evaluate according to this possibility 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 senai in many ways I always blame them one and two 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.330
 but there's a izaÃ­as test I'm going to find for you that I mentioned here 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.499
 the madmen of the new land did not lead the way 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:45.969
 giving to understand that really 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.069
 the mentally ill will have salvation if you have a child under these conditions 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.969
 a relative has no doubts god will turn you and you will have the 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.180
 opportunity to be with this dear 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.810
 in the sky and on the new screen along with chris 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.280
 so the next program faced the falco that a dessert cake at 11 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.220
 Indian header - viewer because this is a subject that is 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.710
 quite pertinent 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.929
 I think it's important 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.799
 we talk 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.439
 on this issue and find the text I now fight so I am not a 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:13.479
 person
