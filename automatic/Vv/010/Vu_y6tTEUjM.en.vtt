00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
surface so it's going to take over the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.170 
surface so it's going to take over the
screen<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.070> second<00:02:26.549> then<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.060> going

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
screen for like a second then it's going

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.250 
screen for like a second then it's going
to<00:02:27.239> take<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.600> stop<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.959> again<00:02:28.170> shut<00:02:29.160> up<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.260> just

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
3 and 3.0 30 and suppression of 300

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.819 
3 and 3.0 30 and suppression of 300
because<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.660> gives<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.380> low<00:02:46.500> light

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
because that gives it like the low light

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.309 
because that gives it like the low light
effect<00:02:48.980> after

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
effect after

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.750 
effect after
that<00:02:50.469> often<00:02:50.859> you've<00:02:50.950> done<00:02:51.099> that<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.609> want

like um reckon you should use that if
you're<00:05:07.059> going<00:05:07.089> to<00:05:07.269> get<00:05:07.449> that<00:05:07.659> kills<00:05:08.229> really

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
you're going to get that kills really

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.719 
you're going to get that kills really
good<00:05:09.069> kills<00:05:09.749> the<00:05:10.749> strength<00:05:11.289> is<00:05:11.919> like<00:05:12.249> matters

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
good kills the strength is like matters

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.629 
good kills the strength is like matters
a<00:05:12.759> lot<00:05:12.969> in<00:05:13.089> this<00:05:13.439> because<00:05:14.439> the<00:05:15.219> higher<00:05:15.459> the

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
a lot in this because the higher the

a lot in this because the higher the
strength<00:05:15.999> the<00:05:16.269> more<00:05:16.479> powerful<00:05:16.959> the<00:05:17.919> actual

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:18.429 
strength the more powerful the actual

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:22.919 
strength the more powerful the actual
thing<00:05:18.459> is<00:05:18.849> so<00:05:20.129> yeah<00:05:21.419> here<00:05:22.419> I'm<00:05:22.569> gonna<00:05:22.689> put

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 
okay so the trick here is to keep the

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.379 
okay so the trick here is to keep the
angle<00:07:02.490> the<00:07:03.149> lowest<00:07:03.419> like<00:07:03.990> i'll<00:07:04.649> use<00:07:05.009> that<00:07:05.389> 2.0

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
angle the lowest like i'll use that 2.0

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:08.929 
angle the lowest like i'll use that 2.0
fruit<00:07:06.749> for<00:07:07.020> free<00:07:07.259> because<00:07:07.770> that's<00:07:08.189> like<00:07:08.339> just

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
fruit for free because that's like just

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:11.540 
fruit for free because that's like just
a<00:07:09.059> little<00:07:09.300> lion<00:07:09.539> vertical<00:07:10.169> lines<00:07:10.319> you<00:07:11.309> can<00:07:11.459> do

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
a little lion vertical lines you can do

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.249 
a little lion vertical lines you can do
whatever<00:07:11.789> angle<00:07:12.240> you<00:07:12.360> want<00:07:12.389> just<00:07:12.869> really<00:07:13.169> up

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
whatever angle you want just really up

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.739 
whatever angle you want just really up
to<00:07:13.409> you<00:07:13.529> but<00:07:14.370> the<00:07:14.580> amount<00:07:14.879> is<00:07:15.120> very<00:07:15.360> important

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
as well the higher the amount the more

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.040 
as well the higher the amount the more
lines<00:07:19.409> you<00:07:19.589> get<00:07:19.830> if<00:07:20.039> you<00:07:20.909> put<00:07:21.269> it<00:07:21.360> to<00:07:21.599> light<00:07:21.809> oh

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
lines you get if you put it to light oh

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.809 
lines you get if you put it to light oh
and<00:07:22.800> by<00:07:22.949> the<00:07:22.979> way<00:07:23.159> if<00:07:23.399> you<00:07:23.610> just<00:07:25.309> see<00:07:26.309> where<00:07:26.610> the
