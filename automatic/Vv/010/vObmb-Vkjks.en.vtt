00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:15.010
 Hello, I am often asked 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:18.980
 about my attitude to open operations 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:26.020
 called ravic operation shelf and so 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:29.419
 then I almost always sent 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.460
 patients and doctors as just an editor 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.520
 who do this operation so as not to 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.079
 to be as unfounded because I myself 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 I think that in principle a lot 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.520
 indications for 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.120
 it is better to do a negative operation 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.390
 nose 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.879
 but it is obvious that patients do not get 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.859
 all the depths of information and me 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.309
 I am very important to talk about 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.359
 some aspects of open surgery 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.100
 which after all becomes possible 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:05.180
 known wide mass of patients in 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.190
 particular i am almost practically 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.420
 strongly opposed to this 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.240
 surgery in children 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.490
 although in general I admit the execution of this 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.680
 adult surgery 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 What is the main reason for this? 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.119
 that in children performing an open surgery 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.549
 associated with the removal of parts of the thing which 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.720
 as it is known is a source of growth 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.320
 bones and such patients to perform 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.479
 open operation resection lashing quite 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.200
 may turn lead later 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.079
 somewhere to develop 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.149
 their things and and actually the edges of us to us 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.920
 patients are turning more and more often 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.320
 which operated 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.079
 in childhood, and operated very 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.220
 respected clinics with large 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.210
 experience of these operations but unfortunately with 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.360
 growing up 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.060
 they being it turned out that the correction 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 turned out to be not so successful as 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.150
 she seemed right after her performance i 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.640
 I want to give the first patient example 25 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.030
 whose years were operated on in a decade 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.860
 age at this stage as it seemed very 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.160
 Successfully, however, the following years the patient 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.530
 it has grown and it turned out that 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.650
 deformation returned true other form 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.829
 some 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.799
 with the subsequent growth it turned out 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.950
 more uncomfortable more unpleasant for him 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.989
 the feature is that it became hard for him 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
 breathe 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.019
 evolved so-called restriction 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.109
 thorax effects of hypoplasia 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.760
 ribs and we did research 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.639
 research conductor like this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.319
 tomography of the patient on which 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:04.910
 very clearly visible 4 5 6 6 ribs 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.380
 underdeveloped one narrow chest 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.269
 as if encompassing and and russian betrothed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.850
 interferes with natural breathing more 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.049
 addition on the missions of things inscriptions 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.240
 full of things developed bone 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:24.860
 bone tissue that betrayed 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.960
 panzer kids similar properties 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.310
 Naturally such a patient besides 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.790
 that he has a rather uneven 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.550
 chest scar across the chest 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.420
 besides, he was absolutely 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:45.800
 functional unsuitable chest 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.050
 to help such patients is extremely difficult and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.280
 we operated on this patient did 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.440
 re operation lifted off 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.200
 severed these bone fragments 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.090
 however, it is now past 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.540
 too little time to talk 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.650
 how much our operations helped him 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.310
 certainly if the percentage was 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.740
 operated on 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.480
 mini-invasive non-resected cartilage 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:17.370
 cause a condition would not have developed and 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.340
 this is not an isolated case literally through 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.060
 a month after we operated on then 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.980
 patient 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:28.080
 but came similar operated also in 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.330
 Moscow clinics with a very large a 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.730
 because 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.220
 similar operations external deformation 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.740
 looks a little better 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.550
 information that is now available like me 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.280
 She didnâ€™t say so 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.280
 initial and initial result immediately 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:53.340
 after the operation seemed beautiful however 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.380
 as you grow and the pharmacy is back and so 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.470
 same as the first considered 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.230
 the patient has developed restriction thoracic 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.540
 rare patient cannot take deep breaths 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.640
 he lacks breathing in sports 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:13.620
 physical exertion and just like 1 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.200
 the patient was won by his sister 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.120
 rib cage due to hypoplasia of the world 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.670
 what to do with this patient since 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.820
 The manifestation principle is somewhat less than 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.250
 at first considering the patient and while 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.830
 We do not know whether he will operate however 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.510
 there is a clear discrepancy between what 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.480
 the surgeons wanted to do that as a result 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.990
 it turned out and again from him the patient 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.820
 was operated on a mini-invasive 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.460
 then people of their similar situations are not 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.980
 happened the main reason here such 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.300
 prospective changes in chest 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.330
 is that the knife is the result of the removal 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.960
 cartilage 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.490
 growth of edges is broken and instead of 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.060
 early duffel fabric 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.660
 bone soil is formed is obtained 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.330
 rigid ones are not capable of expanding and 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:10.650
 also since the patient grew 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.050
 that deformation partially continues 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.840
 returns can not be considered such 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.600
 the result is full and natural 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.440
 none of this would have happened if 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.660
 the patient was operated on 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.090
 these complications are not worth clean after 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.400
 open operations 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.420
 however they are potentially possible and they 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.540
 very seriously 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.230
 in terms of how to fix the chest 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.780
 cage 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.780
 if they happen it is extremely difficult
