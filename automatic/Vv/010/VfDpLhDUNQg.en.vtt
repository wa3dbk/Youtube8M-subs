00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 but just a little look left 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.550
 I only actually have 2 products to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.980
 such very important ones that can 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.360
 complete the cooking process 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.360
 pickle is onions and carrots 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.289
 just simply 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm cleaning 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:40.260
 onion cut it somehow not long again 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.450
 same because of the spoon see i cut it in half 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.899
 Now every half in half again 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.219
 and now I will cut these fragments 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.219
 like a quarter of a ring 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:01:02.270
 onion and carrot carrot I'll clean and we 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.589
 it is not to bathe I its on the corpse 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.589
 look i don't mix carrots and onions 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:17.159
 I keep them apart like this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.729
 I will work with the vegetables with onions and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.939
 carrot 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.740
 namely, I put a little butter and me 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.720
 I need now carrots and onions guys 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.780
 fry and see you have to start 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 always listen and I would not seem 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.500
 carrot dense very vegetable and she 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.649
 cooks as if longer than a bow 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 no onion cooks longer than carrot 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.710
 so I put the pan first 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.780
 my onion will fry a little here 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.850
 and then I'll add a carrot to it 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.850
 here is onion fried now carrot 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.770
 and now remember this trick 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.560
 roasting onions and carrots 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.950
 almost any soup is seasoned like that 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.780
 pieces of vegetables get a little easier 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.820
 carrot stains fat and then on 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.100
 surfaces of any soup such here 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.150
 pleasant will be the pants of such an orange 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.860
 colors are just done for the purpose 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.780
 improve the color of the soup but also enrich it 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.780
 of course some vegetables 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.280
 here heated vegetables with butter fried 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:54.810
 and they went 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.810
 fill the soup and now the last
