top<00:03:21.070> speed<00:03:21.370> what's<00:03:21.670> correct<00:03:22.000> for<00:03:22.300> them<00:03:22.600> but

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
top speed what's correct for them but

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.199 
top speed what's correct for them but
it's<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.040> viewers<00:03:24.400> will<00:03:24.640> assume<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
top speed is a post it was a top tip for

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.350 
top speed is a post it was a top tip for
the<00:03:26.920> pike<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.430> started<00:03:27.790> talking<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.209> bike

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the pike we started talking for the bike

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
know the actual top speed of the bike so

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.680 
know the actual top speed of the bike so
stay<00:03:32.560> tuned<00:03:32.800> for<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:33.700> that's<00:03:34.330> not<00:03:34.510> their
