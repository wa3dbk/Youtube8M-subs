00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
University I think that it's a obviously

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.980 
University I think that it's a obviously
it's<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> pretty<00:00:05.790> unique<00:00:05.970> experience<00:00:06.240> because

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
it's a pretty unique experience because

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.270 
it's a pretty unique experience because
you're<00:00:07.170> an<00:00:07.290> environment<00:00:07.890> that's<00:00:07.950> very

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
you're an environment that's very

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.810 
you're an environment that's very
different<00:00:08.519> usually<00:00:09.030> than<00:00:09.210> your<00:00:09.360> own<00:00:09.510> and

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
different usually than your own and

different usually than your own and
people<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:11.969> generally<00:00:12.389> or<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.320> be

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
people are generally or it can be

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.600

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
language skills and basically I would

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.380

say<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.579> an<00:01:23.700> opportunity<00:01:23.939> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
say that it's an opportunity to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
say that it's an opportunity to
integrate<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.890> they've<00:01:26.040> learned

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.520 
this is hurt you know the all kinds of
interactions<00:02:00.359> that<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.689> taking<00:02:01.020> place<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
interactions that are taking place so

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.830 
interactions that are taking place so
you're<00:02:02.159> you're<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:02.909> forced<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> integrate

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you're you're really forced to integrate

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.300 
you're you're really forced to integrate
a<00:02:04.049> lot<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.560> you've<00:02:04.710> learned<00:02:05.039> here<00:02:05.159> at

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
a lot of what you've learned here at

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.450 
a lot of what you've learned here at
Emory<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.829> happens<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.400> a

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
Emory and that really it happens in a

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.220 
Emory and that really it happens in a
way<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.790> really<00:02:08.910> can't<00:02:09.210> happen<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.630> campus<00:02:09.840> I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
way that really can't happen on campus I

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.050 
way that really can't happen on campus I
mean<00:02:10.680> we<00:02:10.890> ask<00:02:11.070> our<00:02:11.370> students<00:02:11.640> obviously<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
mean we ask our students obviously to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.280 
mean we ask our students obviously to
take<00:02:12.240> into<00:02:12.420> consideration<00:02:13.050> what<00:02:13.140> they've

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
take into consideration what they've

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.610 
take into consideration what they've
learned

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
learned

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
learned
other<00:02:13.739> courses<00:02:14.129> in<00:02:14.310> other<00:02:14.909> disciplines

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
other courses in other disciplines

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.839 
other courses in other disciplines
whenever<00:02:15.810> we're<00:02:16.019> teaching<00:02:16.230> them<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.370> this

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
whenever we're teaching them but in this

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.940 
whenever we're teaching them but in this
kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.299> real-life<00:02:18.750> situation<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.739> all

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
kind of a real-life situation it all

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.250 
kind of a real-life situation it all
comes<00:02:20.220> together<00:02:20.459> in<00:02:20.909> a<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.959> can't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
comes together in a way that you can't

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.850 
comes together in a way that you can't
you<00:02:22.709> can't<00:02:22.950> reproduce<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.569> think<00:02:25.560> these

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
you can't reproduce so I think these

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.789 
you can't reproduce so I think these
experiences<00:02:26.489> are<00:02:26.640> unique<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:28.290> hope

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
experiences are unique in that they hope

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.020 
experiences are unique in that they hope
they<00:02:29.099> force<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.970> student<00:02:30.329> to<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:32.340> look<00:02:32.790> at

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
they force the student to to look at

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.390 
they force the student to to look at
something<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.989> are<00:02:34.230> familiar<00:02:34.470> with<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
something that are familiar with in a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.850 
something that are familiar with in a
difference<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.150> different<00:02:36.569> light<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.959> to

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
difference in a different light and to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.559 
difference in a different light and to
integrate<00:02:38.599> what<00:02:39.599> they've<00:02:39.750> learned

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
