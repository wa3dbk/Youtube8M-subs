feeling<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.990> while<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.670> game

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
feeling a while back but in this game

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640 
feeling a while back but in this game
they<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.479> added<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.960> new<00:01:31.170> game<00:01:31.439> mode

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
they actually added a new game mode

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
they actually added a new game mode
called<00:01:31.729> domination<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.270> plays<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
called domination it plays very

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499 
called domination it plays very
similarly<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.130> domination<00:01:35.939> plays<00:01:36.180> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
similarly to how domination plays in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.520 
similarly to how domination plays in
call<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> duty<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.970> there's<00:01:38.970> no<00:01:39.150> vehicles<00:01:39.630> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
call of duty and there's no vehicles so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.370

another<00:02:37.930> try<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:39.870> improved<00:02:40.870> especially<00:02:41.620> if

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
another try it's improved especially if

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.369 
another try it's improved especially if
you're<00:02:42.010> more<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.430> cod<00:02:42.640> player<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.299> me<00:02:43.540> if

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379

you play in that domination playlist

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
because it's not the same type of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.190 
because it's not the same type of
battlefield<00:02:49.420> experience<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.079> would

maps<00:02:52.540> all<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.900> type<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.079> stuff<00:02:53.200> but<00:02:53.920> it's

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
maps all that type of stuff but it's

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.140 
maps all that type of stuff but it's
kind<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.909> refined<00:02:55.840> down<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.849> something<00:02:57.849> more

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
kind of refined down to something more

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.619 
kind of refined down to something more

failing<00:04:26.320> out

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
failing out

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.220 
failing out
uh<00:04:27.400> which<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:27.880> obviously<00:04:28.570> never<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:28.900> really

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
uh which is obviously never a really

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.290 
uh which is obviously never a really
good<00:04:29.380> idea<00:04:29.670> but<00:04:30.670> it<00:04:30.760> was<00:04:30.820> just<00:04:31.000> because<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.180> a

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
good idea but it was just because of a

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.940 
good idea but it was just because of a
lack<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.510> motivation<00:04:32.020> it's<00:04:32.380> not<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:32.920> I

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
lack of motivation it's not because I

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040 
lack of motivation it's not because I
was<00:04:33.160> struggling<00:04:33.520> with<00:04:33.820> anything<00:04:34.240> or<00:04:34.510> anything

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.119 
school it feels like I'm doing
this<00:06:40.509> for<00:06:40.750> myself<00:06:40.870> because<00:06:41.379> I<00:06:41.590> realized<00:06:41.830> that

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129 
this for myself because I realized that

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:44.670 
this for myself because I realized that
it's<00:06:42.250> an<00:06:42.430> opportunity<00:06:42.699> that<00:06:43.180> I<00:06:43.360> need<00:06:43.629> to<00:06:43.840> seize

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
it's an opportunity that I need to seize

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.860 
it's an opportunity that I need to seize
and<00:06:45.069> it's<00:06:45.280> something<00:06:45.639> that<00:06:46.060> I<00:06:46.330> should<00:06:46.780> have

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
and it's something that I should have

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.689 
and it's something that I should have
done<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.080> long<00:06:47.139> time<00:06:47.319> ago<00:06:47.560> and<00:06:48.009> I<00:06:48.159> need<00:06:48.340> to<00:06:48.460> do<00:06:48.580> it

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
done a long time ago and I need to do it

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.760 
done a long time ago and I need to do it
now<00:06:48.729> and<00:06:49.210> so<00:06:49.750> there's<00:06:49.960> no<00:06:50.169> more<00:06:50.379> messing
