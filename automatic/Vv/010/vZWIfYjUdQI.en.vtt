develop and I'm going to go to crop and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.250 
develop and I'm going to go to crop and
I'm<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.730> sure<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.260> straight

first<00:00:59.300> which<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> little

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
first which I think it is just a little

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.070 
first which I think it is just a little
bit<00:01:01.770> off<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.480> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> drag

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
bit off so then you're going to drag

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.859 
bit off so then you're going to drag
this<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.060> have<00:01:06.060> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.630> less

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you're going to really cool down the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.380 
you're going to really cool down the
temperature<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> create<00:01:48.119> some

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
temperature that's going to create some

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.910 
temperature that's going to create some
contrast<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.110> we're<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
contrast with what we're going to do it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
contrast with what we're going to do it
down<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.909> we're<00:01:51.299> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
down in here and we're going to just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.139 
down in here and we're going to just
drag<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> tint<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> little<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.149> lighter

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
drag the tint to a little bit lighter

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.980 
drag the tint to a little bit lighter
blue<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:56.070> done<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.600> next

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
blue and that's done and then next

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.120 
blue and that's done and then next
you're<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.409> back<00:01:58.590> there<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.009> you're

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you're going to go back there and you're

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.679 
you're going to go back there and you're
going<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.310> create<00:01:59.520> another<00:01:59.790> new<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.149> you're

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to create another new one you're

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.469 
going to create another new one you're
going<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> reset<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.670> eye<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.149> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
going to reset it in this eye on this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.850 
going to reset it in this eye on this
one<00:02:03.540> you're<00:02:03.780> going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> drag<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> temperature

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
one you're going to drag the temperature

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.499 
one you're going to drag the temperature
oh<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:06.420> should<00:02:07.320> probably<00:02:07.439> draw<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.860> first<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.149> um

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
oh I should probably draw it first so um

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.999 
oh I should probably draw it first so um
then<00:02:09.929> we're<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> drag<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.800> high<00:02:10.950> as

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
then we're going to drag this as high as

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.550 
then we're going to drag this as high as
it'll<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:12.720> out<00:02:12.900> there

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it'll go to out there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.080 
it'll go to out there
it<00:02:13.950> doesn't<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.060> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it doesn't have to go all the way up to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.180 
it doesn't have to go all the way up to
there<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.959> we're<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> deal<00:02:17.160> with

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
there because we're going to deal with

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.550 
there because we're going to deal with
the<00:02:17.400> metal<00:02:17.640> part<00:02:18.020> later<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.290> we're<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the metal part later and we're going to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.390 
the metal part later and we're going to
really<00:02:19.980> warm<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:21.660> mid<00:02:22.620> 40s<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.280> we're

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
really warm it up to mid 40s and we're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.490 
really warm it up to mid 40s and we're
going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> make<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.000> tint<00:02:24.300> on<00:02:24.480> or<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:24.959> as<00:02:25.380> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
going to make the tint on or just as you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.949 
going to make the tint on or just as you
can<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:25.860> fits<00:02:26.370> more<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.239> colors

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
can see that fits more with the colors

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.190 
can see that fits more with the colors
that<00:02:28.170> were<00:02:28.290> already<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.830> then<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.880> can

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that were already there and then you can

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.650 
that were already there and then you can
click<00:02:31.200> done<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.190> then<00:02:32.760> our<00:02:33.360> final

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
click done in that and then our final

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.240 
click done in that and then our final
thing<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.319> you're<00:02:34.620> going<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.800> go<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
thing is you're going to go up and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.680 
thing is you're going to go up and
you're<00:02:35.400> going<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:35.580> create<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.880> new<00:02:36.060> brush<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
you're going to create a new brush and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.860 
you're going to create a new brush and
reset<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.450> bump

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
reset it and you're going to really bump

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.190 
reset it and you're going to really bump
up<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.200> warmness<00:02:40.440> into<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.330> high<00:02:42.330> 50s<00:02:42.870> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
up the warmness into the high 50s and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.460 
up the warmness into the high 50s and
the<00:02:43.260> low<00:02:44.040> 50s<00:02:44.580> for<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.849> tint<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.600> you're

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
the low 50s for the tint and you're

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960 
the low 50s for the tint and you're
going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> add<00:02:46.769> just<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.760> of

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
going to add just a little bit of

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.000 
going to add just a little bit of
exposure<00:02:48.510> there<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.140> then<00:02:49.650> you're<00:02:49.830> going<00:02:49.950> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
exposure there and then you're going to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.890 
exposure there and then you're going to
make<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.340> brush<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:51.150> big<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.540> cover<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
make the brush really big to cover the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.390 
make the brush really big to cover the
whole<00:02:52.080> middle<00:02:52.350> of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.920> screen<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.310> you're

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
whole middle of the screen and you're

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.509 
whole middle of the screen and you're
just<00:02:53.519> going<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> drag<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.060> across<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:56.310> this

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
just going to drag it across like this

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.650 
just going to drag it across like this
and<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> little<00:02:56.940> bit<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:59.030> like<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.480> can

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and a little bit up like that you can

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.259 
and a little bit up like that you can
see<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.019> looks<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.319> lot<00:03:01.470> better<00:03:01.680> um<00:03:02.269> I'm

actually<00:03:03.599> going<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.440> brighten<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.099> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
actually going to brighten it up a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.050 
actually going to brighten it up a
little<00:03:05.400> bit<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.060> looks<00:03:06.269> better<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:08.060> mean

the high 50s and the low 50 for the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.650 
the high 50s and the low 50 for the
temperature<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.459> tint<00:03:14.819> pleasure<00:03:15.420> what<00:03:15.630> i

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
temperature in tint pleasure what i

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.449 
temperature in tint pleasure what i
recommend<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.440> obviously<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.250> adjust

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
recommend but obviously you can adjust

recommend but obviously you can adjust
it<00:03:17.940> based<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.299> how<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.660> looks<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.230> actual

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it based on how it looks in the actual

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.580 
it based on how it looks in the actual
photo<00:03:19.940> that<00:03:20.940> looks<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.420> little<00:03:21.870> bit<00:03:22.049> too<00:03:22.380> much

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
photo that looks a little bit too much

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.560 
photo that looks a little bit too much
exposure<00:03:23.130> there<00:03:23.519> we<00:03:23.820> go<00:03:23.940> that's<00:03:24.269> looking

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
exposure there we go that's looking

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.370 
exposure there we go that's looking
better<00:03:24.750> um<00:03:26.269> so<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.750> that's<00:03:27.989> pretty<00:03:28.200> much<00:03:28.290> it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
better um so and that's pretty much it
