what's up guys in this video I'm going
to<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.520> doing<00:00:02.700> an<00:00:02.939> ipad<00:00:03.419> 2<00:00:03.689> versus<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.380> new

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
to be doing an ipad 2 versus the new

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.280 
to be doing an ipad 2 versus the new
iPad<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.400> I'm<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.390> be<00:00:06.480> doing<00:00:06.660> some<00:00:06.990> apps

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
iPad and I'm going to be doing some apps

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.500 
iPad and I'm going to be doing some apps
startup<00:00:07.950> battles<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.790> we<00:00:08.940> can<00:00:09.059> see<00:00:09.300> which

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
startup battles here so we can see which

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.749 
startup battles here so we can see which
one<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.929> actually<00:00:10.290> faster<00:00:10.500> so<00:00:10.920> there<00:00:11.610> have

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
one is actually faster so there have

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.759 
one is actually faster so there have
been<00:00:11.910> some<00:00:12.090> speed<00:00:12.389> tests<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.900> they<00:00:13.380> look<00:00:13.620> to

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
been some speed tests and they look to

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.369 
been some speed tests and they look to
be<00:00:13.799> almost<00:00:14.099> exactly<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.700> same<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.929> ipad<00:00:16.230> 2

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
be almost exactly the same so the ipad 2

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.260 
be almost exactly the same so the ipad 2
is<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> left<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.160> new<00:00:17.430> ipad<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.029> on

is on the left and the new ipad is on
the<00:00:18.539> right<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.590> let's<00:00:19.800> go<00:00:19.920> ahead<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.130> end<00:00:20.400> show

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
2 has an a5 dual-core processor the a 5x

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.340 
2 has an a5 dual-core processor the a 5x
is<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> ipad<00:00:44.219> 3<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.270> has<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.930> dual<00:00:46.170> core

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
is on the ipad 3 and it has a dual core

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
is on the ipad 3 and it has a dual core
processor<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.730> quad-core

one again ipad 3 on the left and ipad 2

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.460 
one again ipad 3 on the left and ipad 2
on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.840> app<00:01:10.049> doesn't<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
retina graphics yet but let's go ahead

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.399 
retina graphics yet but let's go ahead
and<00:01:13.799> check<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.130> out

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.980 

go<00:01:21.409> ahead<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.680> load<00:01:21.799> this<00:01:21.979> last<00:01:22.250> level<00:01:25.990> all

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
go ahead and load this last level all

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.100 
go ahead and load this last level all
right<00:01:27.320> here<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:27.590> go<00:01:30.939> they<00:01:31.939> look<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.450> dead

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
right here we go they look to be dead

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.929 
right here we go they look to be dead
even<00:01:33.560> actually<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:35.920> ipad<00:01:36.920> 3<00:01:37.100> just<00:01:37.399> very<00:01:37.789> very

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
even actually and ipad 3 just very very

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.300 
even actually and ipad 3 just very very
slightly<00:01:38.450> faster<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.560> that's<00:01:39.740> enough<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.130> this

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
slightly faster so that's enough of this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.410 
slightly faster so that's enough of this
app<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:41.770> exited<00:01:42.770> pretty<00:01:43.250> much<00:01:43.460> dead<00:01:43.939> even

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
app and exited pretty much dead even

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.389 
app and exited pretty much dead even
that<00:01:44.539> was<00:01:44.689> like<00:01:44.869> very<00:01:45.110> very<00:01:45.259> close<00:01:45.649> let's<00:01:46.280> go

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
that was like very very close let's go

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.830 
that was like very very close let's go
ahead<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.580> launch<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.970> really<00:01:47.270> intense<00:01:47.570> game

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
ahead and launch a really intense game

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.810 
ahead and launch a really intense game
Infinity<00:01:48.560> Blade<00:01:48.679> this<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.280> first<00:01:49.549> one

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
Infinity Blade this is the first one

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.700 
Infinity Blade this is the first one
just<00:01:50.030> let<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.570> know<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:50.899> is<00:01:51.080> not<00:01:51.229> infinity

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
just let you know this is not infinity

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.309 
just let you know this is not infinity
blade<00:01:51.830> 2<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.729> here<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.479> go<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:56.390> new<00:01:56.509> iPad<00:01:56.899> just

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
blade 2 and here we go the new iPad just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:03.969 
blade 2 and here we go the new iPad just
a<00:01:57.440> little<00:01:57.679> bit<00:01:57.799> faster<00:01:58.009> here<00:02:02.649> they<00:02:03.649> look<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.950> be

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
a little bit faster here they look to be

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.460 
a little bit faster here they look to be
dead<00:02:04.310> even<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:06.580> very<00:02:07.580> very<00:02:07.850> close<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.080> I'm

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
dead even now very very close so I'm

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.520 
dead even now very very close so I'm
apparently<00:02:09.920> no<00:02:10.870> improvement<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
apparently no improvement here with the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
apparently no improvement here with the
new<00:02:12.680> iPad<00:02:13.100> with<00:02:13.370> opening<00:02:13.850> up<00:02:13.970> apps<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.480> stuff

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
new iPad with opening up apps and stuff

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.339 
new iPad with opening up apps and stuff
but<00:02:14.959> let's<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.290> ahead<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:15.440> launch<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.890> game<00:02:16.209> and

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
but let's go ahead and launch a game and

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.630 
but let's go ahead and launch a game and

the<00:03:18.739> ipad<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.340> new<00:03:19.489> ipad<00:03:19.939> is<00:03:20.150> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.540> have

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
the ipad the new ipad is going to have

the ipad the new ipad is going to have
better<00:03:20.900> graphics<00:03:21.439> for<00:03:21.769> gaming<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:23.599> has

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
better graphics for gaming and it has

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.869 
better graphics for gaming and it has
one<00:03:24.109> gigabyte<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.650> ram<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.159> it<00:03:25.250> has<00:03:25.400> more<00:03:25.670> ram

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
one gigabyte of ram so it has more ram

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.119 
one gigabyte of ram so it has more ram
so<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.180> can<00:03:26.299> handle<00:03:26.599> more<00:03:26.750> stuff<00:03:27.079> but<00:03:27.799> for

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
so you can handle more stuff but for

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.190 
so you can handle more stuff but for
processor<00:03:28.609> speed<00:03:28.909> pretty<00:03:29.329> much<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.720> same<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
processor speed pretty much the same so

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.349 
processor speed pretty much the same so
