right she is grazing around some of the
other<00:00:34.170> ones<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.469> probably<00:00:34.739> doing<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579

have all seen my videos peacocks and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.720 
have all seen my videos peacocks and
apps<00:02:56.140> aren't<00:02:56.350> necessarily<00:02:56.830> algae<00:02:57.280> eater<00:02:57.459> so

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
apps aren't necessarily algae eater so

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.610 
apps aren't necessarily algae eater so
you<00:02:58.450> don't<00:02:58.630> have<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.810> way<00:02:59.020> to<00:02:59.080> control<00:02:59.470> your
