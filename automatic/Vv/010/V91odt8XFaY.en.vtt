00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.260
 it's been quite a while since 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.660
 the history of the 151 was published 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.999
 cursed cartridges one of the stories 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.519
 more controversial but it will be true this 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.589
 story probably is not entirely 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.840
 but yes many details that counts if 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.210
 are true in this video I will share 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.250
 points of view were to deny events and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.530
 others will be confirmed more what is 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.750
 it's true that not everything is a lie, it's him 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.780
 and I foxx and continue with the second 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.450
 part of the 151 cursed cartridges of 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.550
 pokemon let's start the nineties a new 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.800
 it was advertising and ambition to these 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.510
 heights companies would bet their soul 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.609
 to achieve a place in the world to 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.620
 get money and fame the superiors 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.449
 they would force their subordinates to go 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.579
 against their morale to achieve goals and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.980
 objectives all part of a superior plan 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.319
 of owners and rulers in this era 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.420
 puts game freak company sponsored by 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.609
 senior managers of the Japanese government and 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.829
 American investors but because in 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.420
 a video game company is 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.010
 important to clarify that from the 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.199
 existence of civilized humanity 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.760
 the great leaders of this have 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 used the means that are at your 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 scope to manipulate society and 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.190
 in our time 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.470
 has been the newspaper radio television and 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.460
 why not reach young people with 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.080
 video game 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.020
 remember they have the power and the resources 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.400
 to reach each one of us but 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.750
 there are 151 cursed cartridges 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.970
 let's understand something are not cartridges 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.010
 possessed are cartridges with a 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.930
 special programming and a message 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.000
 hidden that creates a reaction with which 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.490
 interacts achieving something unknown 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040
 for us then the question is is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.080
 possible this clear that it is and all 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.150
 we know hypnosis this is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.070
 real if you can reach and enter the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.960
 mind of the people and make them believe 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.090
 what we propose and act on 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.729
 according to our indications and other 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.210
 even more known and used 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.430
 blatantly by the powerful 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.710
 companies are the subliminal messages 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.710
 they still believe that it is a lie 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.560
 history of the 151 cursed cartridges 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 now we all know that this is possible 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.390
 and real but what intention would they have with 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.729
 these cartridges the answer is not so 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.470
 complicated and they were only part of one 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.570
 pilot test to perfect the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.239
 manipulation technique to recruit 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.050
 followers move masses have people to their 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.180
 provision 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.490
 of the same ideal of the great 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.400
 corporations let's start with details a 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.290
 little more specific one the first 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
 versions were the green and the red 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.400
 after these events they decided alone 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.890
 take out in the rest of the world the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 red and blue leaving the green as a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.240
 sad memory of the mysteries that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.890
 tormented the red version is resumed 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.410
 just for being the version that most 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.270
 sold in Japan logic tells us if 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.160
 Pokemon was so famous that he threw it 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.560
 everyone why not continue with 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.420
 the same versions after the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 deaths saw the effects achieved 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.110
 they made adjustments and they relaunched the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.430
 product to everyone the first 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.710
 September 1998 2 that we both know 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.080
 of game freak is a ghost company 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.880
 that was also only created for the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.860
 only purpose to create pokemon and not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.230
 risk other more recognized brands 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.390
 if game freak disappeared because something 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.420
 it would have gone wrong nobody would have lost 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.430
 much in itself 3 because they do not have parents 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.200
 the characters very easy 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.750
 subconsciously they are telling you 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.489
 that they can do things alone that 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.890
 You can trust anything to 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.960
 fulfill a mission or objective are 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.970
 so that when they give an order the 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.220
 creators of this truculent message 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.319
 we or those who have played adhere 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.810
 the order immediately and we created ourselves 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.940
 able to not ask anyone's permission to go 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 where we want to defeat everyone 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.320
 let's go home to anyone by 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.600
 any object without doubt the values 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.520
 which reflects the game are not healthy 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.560
 for children who try it would die 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.240
 of hunger and fatigue also give 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.489
 understand machismo in which at a 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.650
 mother is not held accountable for that reason the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.569
 they put to show us that although she 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.900
 it does not matter and it can not stop 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.030
 our decisions 4 is mentioned like this neither 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.160
 I want nakamura one of the managers 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.380
 of the game freak audio is still alive 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.690
 that you have registered a released game 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.580

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.010
 where he participated as director of 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.260
 audio mentions that he committed suicide in forest 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.450
 aoki gara which we will pick up later 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 since this forest is an essential part in 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.470
 the story of pokemon is also said 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.540
 that he used his wife to develop the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.460
 music of the town the band sato guaro is 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.200

 of healthiness of children affected by 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.830
 this music how did she get those 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.050
 records 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.240
 they already knew what would happen and they were at 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.349
 so much in this mafia network I show you 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.780
 an example of records April 12 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.740

 insomnia addiction to the video game

 nasal hemorrhages turned into 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.509
 violent activities against others and 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:02.629
 eventually self lacerations April 27 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:07.940
 1996 11 migraines irritability point 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:10.969
 March 4 1996 7 migraines behavior 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.430
 Slow 0 body response turned into 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.409
 deafness and the victim disappeared on 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.240
 body was found next to a 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:22.250
 way on April 20, 1996 5 none of 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.080
 the mentioned characters appears in the 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.969
 developer staff of the first 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.189
 pokemon version except for 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.779
 satoshi tajiri game director and he's 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.020
 who did not see is programming director 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.389
 6 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.690
 it was also a pre-launch to test 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:40.110
 the 151 cartridges since the game was 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.270
 developed in 1996 years is a lot 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.710
 time for a simpler game and this 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.720
 it's because they spent the time 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.180
 enough for your tests with the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.069
 hidden messages it is important to mention 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.409
 that the first brand or name to register 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.330
 by game freak was my one was pokemon ni 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.190
 the names of the characters but migo 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.440
 this is because his intentions were 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.479
 very clear about this character 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.789
 now everything starts to make sense 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.550
 because they would first register the name of 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:07.889
 my a pokemon not obtainable a pokemon 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.780
 hidden that it was not more logical to register 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.449
 first the name of the video games and 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.909
 green and red pokemon characters had 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.620
 several throws and this first shot 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:21.990
 of 151 was made on December 21 of 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.240
 1995 in the third part of this video 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.699
 I will put real images of the game version 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.580
 Japanese green will be that this is one of 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.229
 those cartridges see the sample this 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.240
 I have it in my possession and I 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:36.120
 I will show many hidden secrets in the 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.650
 really awesome by the way in the 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.750
 first part of this video 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.590
 mixed a voice that apparently says already 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.479
 is at minute 7 56 that I do not 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.430
 I recorded and I do not know where it comes from 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.560
 I know not even microphones other 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.539
 comment on the completion of this 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.460
 second part and with what I investigated 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.500
 I found many more things that 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.750
 sure they will be interested and will be in the 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.759
 third part besides that you feel a 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.919
 cold and cloudy environment while 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:05.009
 I relate to the subject and you what 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.840
 they are my fox and subscribe be my 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.300
 channel to be the first in 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.660
 find out about the research change 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.660
 and outside
