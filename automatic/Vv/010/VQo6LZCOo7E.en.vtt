00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 day today we do the review 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 application of the concealer of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.190
 old man taken to the cosmoprof is called 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.509
 dusan a council treatment mine 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.550
 heart lightning we start with me that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.140
 I don't have our corrector then at 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 moment practically here we are alone 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.849
 the foundation is there to say and releases there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 to say that today I do not have glasses and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.130
 very pronounced we try the same ad 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.469
 apply it to see if you see the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.309
 difference, however, between an eye and a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.180
 other then yes today no dark circles 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.399
 we apply the same 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.230
 the girl inside you see that there 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.000
 there are two colors, one lighter and one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 dark or one is more salmon and the other 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.059
 to be clearer he told me to 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:56.210
 do it this way now apply to the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:59.930
 center of the glasses the most color 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 Salmonato that goes well I don't know if 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.379
 book with the rest of the color of the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.750
 my face 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.220
 here's it this way after that with the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 lighter color 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.090
 I'm going to light up the outside 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:26.270
 the inner one 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.270
 at this point they shoot 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.479
 here 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.579
 I pull down to the vast money 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.100
 obviously he used a small brush there 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.380
 when they applied to me I want to do 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.140
 an everyday application ie 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 what we would do in the office 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.910
 in front of the mirror an ok bathroom I have 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.830
 put on one side yes on the other no 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.950
 let's see if you can see the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:06.260
 difference between the two eyes considered 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.530
 precisely that today I have no dark circles 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.500
 very marked, however, the difference between the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.630
 two eyes already notice a lot 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.250
 maybe now I put this on standby 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 video and shoot it one morning in the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 which I will have more more shadows anyway 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.430
 this is a this is a first 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.200
 application and the difference already was 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.610
 known now applied both parts 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.150
 I have to go and correct the blush a bit 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.430
 because I went to the blush mi area 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.720
 I took a little too much has one 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.830
 extremely creamy consistency 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 there are no parabens petronÃ  three 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.340
 petrolati and friars be water keeper face 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.590
 Ebadi 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.750
 so this is the product if not 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.830
 the girl told me wrongly 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 selling price is 39 euros 39 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.670
 dollars I proudly paid 20 euros with 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.040
 which this is the result on a face with 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.959
 unmarked birds see each other again in a 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.739
 moment when glasses oils and more 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.600
 marked we say that in these days the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.920
 glasses just does not mention 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.510
 to disappear 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.530
 I show you the use of the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.600
 checker as a touch app 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.000
 mid-day touch up I am indeed 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.570
 quarter to two 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:31.370
 I found myself this morning at 8 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:35.180
 let's go to retouch the trick then a 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:41.470
 fast thing we continue to 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:48.560
 same way as orange corrector 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.110
 on the eye by doing just between 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.600
 hurry 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.900
 and clearer concealer here on the outside 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.820
 of the eye to look up a little 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.540
 we say among other things just just to 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.820
 so simple it is mascara 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.280
 simple harry but now I've already put it 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:16.110
 let's face it a bit outside the house is 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.110
 Also co I think does a good job 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:27.640
 and from here we have to roll it out to raise 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:33.270
 the look also here we put ourselves 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:37.120
 even a little boy with a little finger 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:42.840
 inside the eye where to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.840
 the shadow areas are created 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.290
 et voila now I am going to hang out for 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.630
 well because I don't want to hurry a 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.230
 exit anyway with the concealer a 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.230
 stains 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.150
 however in the end you see that even with the 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.040
 finger is absolutely feasible or 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.240
 glitter that nails come off 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.919
 and settle on your face now if you 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 go to the beginning of this piece 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:20.979
 of videos and then at the end you will see or not 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.139
 see the difference of the first and the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.479
 then I still like it a lot 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.090
 this product for now i 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.070
 review veiling so I think that already 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.380
 in the first part of the video you could see the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.260
 difference between one side and the other of the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.250
 face to me no I surely know it 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.200
 we can do so will dust him in 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.419
 some faces of the day 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.190
 maybe with a few more eyes 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.590
 pronounced then they come to me 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.530
 caio better is among other things I've seen 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.840
 right today that snow makeup is out 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.520
 will come out better next week if 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.830
 I'm not wrong with nos and also the rhino 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.810
 man with hide a concealer in 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.160
 cream and among other things a shade and also 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.120
 orange juice so it could be a 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.570
 substitute available in Italy here 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.820
 since this is not the case, I don't have it 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.919
 seen no review or seen 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.099
 by chance today that will come out to the point this 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:19.450
 snow makeup product and nothing this 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:22.000
 it is precisely the application I go 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.840
 meters a bit of powder to fix it and to 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.840
 next video hello
