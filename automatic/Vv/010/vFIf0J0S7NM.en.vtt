00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
September

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
She was the one who took

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
so extreme decision.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
She once imagined.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
She saw her life without knowing

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When he showed up,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
he transformed her joy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Words of love.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
She fakes kisses, breaks your heart.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Innocent way of looking

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but she was soon going to suspect.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Among tears she was seen crossing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
looking for someone that can console her.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But she was going to find no one.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And she saw her father keeping it,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
very secret in that place,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the old gun that she would soon find. Oh no!

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Listen sighing.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Their meeting is going to happen.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Shoot for love

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
very well-aimed in his heart.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
September

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
September

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
