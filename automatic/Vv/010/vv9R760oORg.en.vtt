00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
they could be a bit later and but I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.930 
they could be a bit later and but I
don't<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.250> whether<00:00:50.370> that's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
don't know whether that's just to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.709

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
without further ado let's get the game

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
without further ado let's get the game
so<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> story<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.489> not
