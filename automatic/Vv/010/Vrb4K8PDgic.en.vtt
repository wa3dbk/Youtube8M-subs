 I already talked about it with the collection 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.430
 spring-summer that I really liked 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 many products clashed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 too much when I had the chance to go 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.490

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.140

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 Marc Ouimet in fact I was asked if I 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.920

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 discount on the website so I like to show 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 a novelty that have for the fall 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.710
 winter with the certain products that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.090
 I had this is the news that these 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 different from necessarily sent 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.390
 many things and so I love them 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 know children m it's all closed so 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.850
 it is the sugar and spices salon that is 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 like this one then I got that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.680
 I had balls is a little go you 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.909
 because otherwise we do not feel them 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 but I completely opposite 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.530
 a small first intention but 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 I had recently in general marigold 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.590
 safari it smells like a champion back and 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.229
 the world 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.650
 it's even the brede that I see 506 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.810
 too much to my god it smells very good 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 it's really going to leave for 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.930
 winter what is really a good 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.189
 perfume represents very well why he 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.300
 took my chance it really makes a 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.000
 beautiful gift given decently 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.510
 for christmas products by m I also 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.480
 a collective and the anthem so he gets 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.700
 present like this as bits 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.120
 small packages then I really like 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.860
 eucalyptus so I hasten to see this 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.860
 that he will smell in the eyes 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.640
 I do not have to make you a soldier of 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.840
 the ECA litigation on certain reactions 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.400
 then she really the little touch of 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.360
 lyme tale penniless then and hulk 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.760
 all arrive in any case you have 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.710
 really really like what with the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.490
 little touch of citrus really 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.110
 Great 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.420
 I also know that just 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.880
 I already had really 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 I can introduce myself as orange is 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.270
 it is available I believe in everything 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.460
 time because I had bought it already 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.120
 they are really good it smells like a 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.480
 little tidy up the entrance it smells so much 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 good that I suggest you 100% sense 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.090
 precisely she sent me a buoy 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.760
 body butter that just to say 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.980
 as I am but last year as 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.040
 borrowed from the meadow when I bought this 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.170
 frozen color already buy them just for 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.120
 I really had a lot and that's 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.959
 the greens of the body thugs with 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.410
 80% shea butter 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.790
 it's true engine lights up in game that I 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.489
 think everyone must love this 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.080
 blue color so I count you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.730
 search for and gifts according to george 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.160
 we know everyone can love and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.080
 between me I know when I was at 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.270
 the workshop everyone liked 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 this water in their center at the bungs 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.920
 worse before and the body butter is 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.080
 really it's like it's great 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.180
 paid to see on Thursday I have my self to 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.000
 Lille as a caterer you take it 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.610
 more thoroughly in Oregon I love I have 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.050
 successful I really tried by way 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.970
 Too beautiful is a death and smiling to 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.020
 oats and honey so that represents 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.760
 only one and then I suffer like that the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:59.110
 saffron really good and all packed 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:05.750
 such as these will struggle to an end 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:07.490
 it really feels at ge keith sherin the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.010
 product exactly but I think that 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.730
 we know it's a soap to land 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.200
 that the same smell yes that's it I 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.750
 think it's that yesterday know that it 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.170
 I get smells and then I give him that 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.030
 really smell then I tried it all 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.310
 and I advise you videos had 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.440
 eyes and parliament that has some 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.910
 of them as having the one there that 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.470
 will pop in but I can you 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.560
 want more leave here it is an oil 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.930
 scented with syrup the foil for the body 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.400
 more house is written so I put them 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.930
 on me today when I received it 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.290
 that sometimes have me he really felt 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.710
 beautiful and Mass at St. Jacques had 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.210
 squarely then for the house runs from 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.220
 see finally because it's really a 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.770
 oil so between that I liked a lot 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.660
 May 9th it's a different name from in 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.810
 the if I'm not mistaking him for body at the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.590

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.060
 rice so that's what writing and sadi am 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.250
 one moisturizing and light for the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.010
 body with his son's lawyers 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.169
 rice and coconut used on skin 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.810
 wet after the night moisturize protects 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.840
 to feel you seriously mum is 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:20.390
 fan of the front i 'm a little bit 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:23.780
 too much to my god it feels unfairly to 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.800
 sell if it's the kind of things that 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.400
 I would really like to become the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.089
 kindergarten they say that pretty much it's 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.679
 a 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.899
 it's a big tile anyway for 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:37.360
 the body yes what is very liquid 

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.589
 but it really feels the language for 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.389
 those who are lighthouse of the sale what 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:42.610
 I kept a lot who really like 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.399
 the doctor from the front so if I were 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.849
 little I have a shiny lips to the 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.679
 vanilla in a little pot like that and I 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.069
 go open it to see if it smells 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:55.869
 really vanilla minus 500 injured 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.619
 light I can show you 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.909
 it's like this one more product 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.649
 to get you can find them on 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.569
 the website and its name on the list 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.909

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.599

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.909
 stars tf1 nails he feels nothing of 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.879
 particular we know justin bieber like 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:17.739
 this one I used it more for my 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.439
 nails because especially winter is 

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:22.629
 really super dry all around 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.989

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.429
 heart who for Christmas this candle on 

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:30.129
 is actually for the entire winter 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:37.839
 it's a fir-tree candle 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:40.899
 a sawyer candle so five arms that 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:43.209
 meaning purely Christmas tree there but 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:47.979
 I had dinner but it really feels 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:50.110
 the ca bègles as they say it's the kind 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:53.259
 of blackmail that I know about leaving him 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.509
 in my living room during page info sa 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:58.209

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.279
 bath then his wife just like 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:02.739
 true system I have with the smell so 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:04.379
 really expect the trick are fans of 

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:07.360
 this kind of right I advise you 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:10.300
 so here's the news and the 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.159
 products as little regular of a 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.749
 heap I hope you have an exit 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.259
 video and have often criticized 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.259
