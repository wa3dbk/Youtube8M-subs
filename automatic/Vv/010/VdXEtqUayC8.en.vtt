00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
bash on it I just think it is overweight

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.650 
bash on it I just think it is overweight
overweight<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.700> does<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.970> mean<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.209> it's<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
overweight it does it mean that it's a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.259 
overweight it does it mean that it's a
bad<00:02:50.020> weapon<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.769> just<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.310> as<00:02:51.550> good<00:02:51.820> as

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
bad weapon it's just not as good as

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.080 
bad weapon it's just not as good as
people<00:02:52.959> say<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.610> reason<00:02:54.760> why<00:02:55.060> I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
people say it is and the reason why I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.080 
people say it is and the reason why I
think<00:02:55.570> that<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:55.780> weapon<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.170> overrated<00:02:56.830> is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870 
think that this weapon is overrated is
because<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.420> weapon<00:02:58.810> introduced<00:02:59.500> on<00:02:59.680> a

the Sun dragon is just pretty much the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.720 
the Sun dragon is just pretty much the
exact<00:03:13.360> same<00:03:13.630> thing<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> wing<00:03:14.380> staff<00:03:14.730> must

be an amazing weapon and don't get me
wrong<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:19.000> good<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.350> when<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.620> compare<00:03:20.829> it

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
wrong it's good but when you compare it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.210 
wrong it's good but when you compare it
to<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.720> Lightning<00:03:23.079> staff<00:03:23.350> or<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
to like the the Lightning staff or the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.030 
to like the the Lightning staff or the
ice<00:03:24.730> staff<00:03:25.180> or<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.720> don't<00:03:26.350> know<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.650> fire<00:03:26.860> so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
ice staff or I don't know the fire so

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.970 
ice staff or I don't know the fire so
I'm<00:03:27.130> not<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> family<00:03:27.519> fire<00:03:27.910> staff<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.510> i<00:03:28.980> think

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
I'm not a family fire staff but i think

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.610 
I'm not a family fire staff but i think
that<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.600> non-operated<00:03:31.600> Lightning<00:03:31.989> staff<00:03:32.260> is

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
that the non-operated Lightning staff is

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.229 
that the non-operated Lightning staff is
better<00:03:33.010> than<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> upgrade<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.850> win<00:03:34.000> staff

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
better than the upgrade to win staff

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.930 
better than the upgrade to win staff
that's<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:34.750> my<00:03:34.959> opinion<00:03:34.989> guys<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.860> just<00:03:36.220> don't

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that's just my opinion guys I just don't

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.900 
that's just my opinion guys I just don't
think<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.630> weapon<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.230> really<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.310> good<00:03:39.670> I

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
think this weapon is really that good I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.720 
think this weapon is really that good I
never<00:03:40.660> use<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.110> weapon<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:41.739> like<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.430> talked

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
never use this weapon and like I talked

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.690 
never use this weapon and like I talked
about<00:03:42.970> before<00:03:43.739> crafting<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.860> thing<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.400> low

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
about before crafting the thing the low
