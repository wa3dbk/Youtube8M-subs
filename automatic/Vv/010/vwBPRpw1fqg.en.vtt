00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
unless his natural position I believe I
think<00:01:30.000> he's<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> big<00:01:30.390> point<00:01:30.570> guard<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:30.930> he's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
think he's a big point guard so he's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.270 
think he's a big point guard so he's
challenging<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.710> those<00:01:31.829> minutes<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.250> think

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
challenging for those minutes I think

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
challenging for those minutes I think
coaches<00:01:32.880> still<00:01:33.060> trying<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> figure<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.659> what

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
coaches still trying to figure out what

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.179

he<00:01:33.930> wants<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.810> position

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
difference with the way to the eye

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.910 
difference with the way to the eye
what's<00:02:16.019> been<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.230> difference<00:02:16.410> though<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
what's been the difference though I

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770 
what's been the difference though I
think<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.849> weight<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.060> think<00:02:18.299> he's<00:02:18.599> coming

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
think the weight I think he's coming

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780 
think the weight I think he's coming
down<00:02:19.080> from<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> little<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.160> he's<00:02:20.549> still

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
down from it a little bit he's still

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.130 
down from it a little bit he's still
strong<00:02:21.060> but<00:02:21.090> he's<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.660> least<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.019> know<00:02:22.110> he's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
strong but he's at least you know he's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.140 
strong but he's at least you know he's
getting<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.340> know<00:02:23.489> that<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
getting that that you know that that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.460 
getting that that you know that that
weighed<00:02:24.330> out<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.720> he<00:02:24.870> wasn't<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.379> know

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
weighed out that he wasn't you know

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.199 
weighed out that he wasn't you know
running<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.400> he's<00:02:26.549> getting<00:02:26.760> someone<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.030> wait

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
running so he's getting someone to wait

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.000 
running so he's getting someone to wait
up<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.510> he's<00:02:27.599> still<00:02:27.810> strong<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.200> his<00:02:28.799> eye<00:02:28.980> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
up but he's still strong in his eye I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.319 
up but he's still strong in his eye I
think<00:02:29.370> he's<00:02:29.489> catching<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:29.940> shooting<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.180> lot

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
think he's catching and shooting a lot

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.930 
think he's catching and shooting a lot
more<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.230> his<00:02:31.560> his<00:02:32.099> game<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.549> always

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
more I think his his game is always

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.339 
more I think his his game is always
going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.120> improve<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.780> he's<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> guy<00:02:34.140> who's

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
going to improve and he's a guy who's

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.509 
going to improve and he's a guy who's
going<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.560> get<00:02:34.650> better<00:02:34.829> throughout<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
going to get better throughout the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.490 
going to get better throughout the
season<00:02:35.880> because<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.720> really<00:02:36.870> coming<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.319> late
