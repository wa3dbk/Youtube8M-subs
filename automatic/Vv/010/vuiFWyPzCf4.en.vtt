get to see the sunspot grow and fairly

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.690 
get to see the sunspot grow and fairly
violent<00:01:17.189> reactions<00:01:17.820> thereafter<00:01:18.799> now<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
violent reactions thereafter now it is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
violent reactions thereafter now it is
worth<00:01:20.939> noting<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.840> fairly<00:01:22.320> faint

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
worth noting we do have a fairly faint

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
worth noting we do have a fairly faint
but<00:01:23.310> active<00:01:23.700> magnetic<00:01:24.150> filament<00:01:24.540> attached<00:01:25.080> to

but active magnetic filament attached to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
but active magnetic filament attached to
the<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.590> looks<00:01:26.280> fairly<00:01:26.460> similar<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the some looks fairly similar to the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.350 
the some looks fairly similar to the
februari<00:01:27.990> filament<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.680> 2010<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.180> that's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
februari filament in 2010 so that's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.300 
februari filament in 2010 so that's
worth<00:01:30.509> keeping<00:01:30.869> close<00:01:31.079> notice<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> there's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
worth keeping close notice of there's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.969 
worth keeping close notice of there's
also<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.970> solar<00:01:33.329> tsunami<00:01:33.750> effect<00:01:34.470> shortly

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
also a solar tsunami effect shortly

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.399 
also a solar tsunami effect shortly
after<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> ex-player<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> that's<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
after the ex-player and that's in

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
after the ex-player and that's in
progress<00:01:37.950> right<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> be

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
progress right now so we're going to be

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.499 
progress right now so we're going to be
seeing<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:40.189> reaction<00:01:41.189> shortly<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.479> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
seeing this reaction shortly so this is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.730 
seeing this reaction shortly so this is
extremely<00:01:43.110> violent<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.720> also<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.200> northern

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
extremely violent and also the northern

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.490 
extremely violent and also the northern
hemisphere<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:47.610> reacted<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.270> well<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.810> this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
hemisphere has reacted as well so this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
hemisphere has reacted as well so this
event<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> extremely<00:01:50.610> powerful<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.600> has

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
event is extremely powerful and it has

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.630 
event is extremely powerful and it has
affected<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.229> solar<00:01:52.439> corona<00:01:52.649> quite

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
affected the solar corona quite

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
affected the solar corona quite
significantly<00:01:54.320> ok<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.649> these<00:01:55.770> later

appear that it is earthbound we do get

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
appear that it is earthbound we do get
to<00:02:04.439> see<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> halo<00:02:05.040> effect<00:02:05.189> virtually<00:02:06.180> around

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
to see a halo effect virtually around

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.990 
to see a halo effect virtually around
the<00:02:06.750> entire<00:02:07.020> disk<00:02:07.320> here<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.879> there<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the entire disk here so there is a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.279 
the entire disk here so there is a
strong<00:02:09.239> likelihood<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.050> may<00:02:10.229> be

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
strong likelihood that we may be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.350 
strong likelihood that we may be
receiving

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
receiving

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.520 
receiving

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
auroras in the northern hemisphere

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.620 
auroras in the northern hemisphere

towards the equator region in and around
two<00:02:17.870> days<00:02:18.050> time<00:02:18.320> perhaps<00:02:18.620> februari<00:02:19.340> 17<00:02:20.260> okay

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
two days time perhaps februari 17 okay

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.590 
two days time perhaps februari 17 okay
looking<00:02:21.530> at<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.800> 193<00:02:22.310> angstrom<00:02:22.880> we<00:02:23.240> do<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.480> to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
looking at the 193 angstrom we do get to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.390 
looking at the 193 angstrom we do get to
see<00:02:23.630> something<00:02:23.930> quite<00:02:24.200> interesting<00:02:24.410> here<00:02:24.770> we

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
see something quite interesting here we

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.460 
see something quite interesting here we
do<00:02:25.550> see<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.060> sunspot<00:02:26.480> region<00:02:26.810> grow<00:02:27.020> quite

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
do see this sunspot region grow quite

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.920 
do see this sunspot region grow quite
rapidly<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.250> lots<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.850> activity<00:02:29.300> headed

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
rapidly and the lots of activity headed

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.170 
rapidly and the lots of activity headed
out<00:02:30.020> words<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.250> tears<00:02:31.490> that<00:02:31.610> most<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.090> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
out words but the tears that most of the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.120 
out words but the tears that most of the
activities<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.050> energies<00:02:33.590> are<00:02:33.770> actually

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
activities and energies are actually

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.440 
activities and energies are actually
solar<00:02:34.490> bound<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:34.970> other<00:02:35.090> words<00:02:35.330> you're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
solar bound in other words you're

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.990 
solar bound in other words you're
actually<00:02:35.570> heading<00:02:35.990> backwards<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.700> do<00:02:37.820> get

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
actually heading backwards so we do get

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.410 
actually heading backwards so we do get
to<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.600> formation<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.320> coronal<00:02:39.740> holes<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
to see a formation of coronal holes and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.699 
to see a formation of coronal holes and
the<00:02:41.420> ignition<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.050> some<00:02:42.260> other<00:02:42.380> active

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
the ignition of some other active

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.949 
the ignition of some other active
regions<00:02:43.100> due<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.490> activity<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.840> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
regions due to this activity so it is

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.170 
regions due to this activity so it is
worth<00:02:45.140> noting<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.950> although<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:47.030> will

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
worth noting that the although we will

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.699 
worth noting that the although we will
be<00:02:47.300> receiving<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.870> effects<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.530> earth

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
be receiving the effects here on earth

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.240 
be receiving the effects here on earth
as<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.000> son's<00:02:50.300> body<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.660> earth<00:02:50.900> facing<00:02:51.709> it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
as this son's body is earth facing it

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.440 
as this son's body is earth facing it
appears<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.820> majority<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.300> these

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
appears that the majority of these

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.420 
appears that the majority of these
energies<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.140> violent<00:02:54.830> energies<00:02:55.280> are

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
energies and violent energies are

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.800 
energies and violent energies are
actually<00:02:55.760> headed<00:02:56.000> back<00:02:56.180> towards<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.600> solar

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
actually headed back towards a solar

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.790 
actually headed back towards a solar
corona<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.130> worth<00:02:58.310> keeping<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.760> note<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
corona so that's worth keeping a note of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.560 
corona so that's worth keeping a note of
the<00:03:00.800> KP<00:03:01.130> index<00:03:01.459> has<00:03:01.610> picked<00:03:01.820> up<00:03:01.970> fairly

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
the KP index has picked up fairly

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.470 
the KP index has picked up fairly
sizable<00:03:03.170> geomagnetic<00:03:03.650> disturbances<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:05.000> this

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
sizable geomagnetic disturbances so this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.120 
sizable geomagnetic disturbances so this
does<00:03:05.660> appear<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:06.020> some<00:03:06.650> significant

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
does appear that some significant

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.100 
does appear that some significant
activities<00:03:07.610> are<00:03:07.820> headed<00:03:08.120> our<00:03:08.239> way<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.720> terms

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
activities are headed our way in terms

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.260 
activities are headed our way in terms
of<00:03:09.290> earthquakes<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.550> will<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.820> making<00:03:10.970> an
