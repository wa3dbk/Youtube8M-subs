00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.990
 the Olympic athletes and back hung 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.470
 with me there that was the game now goes 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.470
 the marbles 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.640
 great advertisers for the new 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.530
 doors knock things at a large 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.650
 some of our gold medal in sven 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.090
 kramer pantomime van is this true home 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.520
 we have that view together 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.239
 friend with the sponges contract 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 yes to a large extent 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.480
 yes it is to call me quite the mirror 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 us very happy to heroes that was already so 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 in the in the ancient times in the arena with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 top athletes and there is little to it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.379
 changed only yes they can now what 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.640
 more to get what what is the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.899
 commercial value of a gold 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.159
 medal silver medal bronze 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.629
 medal 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.309
 you can put very complicated formulas on it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.930
 let go that has to do with the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.670
 appearance of the athlete has too 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.050
 so with the sport a bit one 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
 weird year and we don't have one person 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.320
 that a lot of gold but we have it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 very much to stick in it too 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 price pressure place I think you could do better 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 win 1st gold on your own than that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.850
 everyone goes again so that I am yes now 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.320
 I think there are a large number 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.820
 so your advertisers can choose 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.890
 you are looking for something more than just one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.600
 medal mother story is behind and 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 my experience is that it's about it 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.290
 total picture goes into a brand is not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 only interested in a golden one 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.979
 medal is about millions of money 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 tons it's certainly not about 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.340
 millions and not too many tons 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.829
 but I think that you are between 50 and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.369
 the 200 often 200 250,000 euros can 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.369
 get on a year 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.760
 Oh 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.260
 do you expect to see again 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.060
 in the only ready huiting 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.410
 I think the Mulder brothers look at that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 have a kind of course 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.680
 item hole at nos with that game 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 she was fighting against each other 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 can be human with the year a powder 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.340
 maybe make a movie to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.260
 for example yes who knows 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.330
 yes but as a dance I think differently no 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.170
 no oh you must pay attention that you yourself 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.000
 remains that you ensure that it is relevant 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.229
 I have very sweet and clips too 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.150
 to experience in which phase of your 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 career you see there are sure number 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.820
 caterpillars athletes who are still in four years 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.080
 perform better 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.610
 you should not be in every commercial from now 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.600
 you can better and expect and if 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 you when you reach the end of the career 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.030
 benthem then you just have to figure out what 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.030
 you can 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.320
 well almost yes now just to crash 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.700
 because you start your way again 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.560
 be there in four years became olympic 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
 and then you have none at all 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.770
 idea what to do bob the young there 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
 you get that salt that can't use that radio 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.240
 maybe just do good tip 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.320
