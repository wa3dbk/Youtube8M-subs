 is that they want to see them all simply 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.500
 go totally down 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.390
 is the whole list we are going to download a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.480
 support maybe 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.670

 other things to see your bookstore by 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.909
 example if we already say that we are up 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.909

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.319

 Safari pdf and keep it here in your 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.760
 ipad is also very useful because there 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.860
 many books that are paid can 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.100

 they are not going to transfer is cool, it's clear 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.709
 the only time if they have it on their ipad 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.140
 it will not necessarily be in your 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.420
 iphone but the books that are downloaded 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.700
 free if they are going to synchronize 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.530
 between your iphone and your ipad and is that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.050
