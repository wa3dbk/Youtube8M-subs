00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.550
 well so today we find ourselves 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.809
 for a new aluminum tutorial I 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.099
 I said it would be nice of you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.350
 show how to make small 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.449
 Creole in the final so it's creole you 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.949
 have already realized in the shop 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.630
 when I was creative I thought 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.090
 that it would be nice to spin you off 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 little trick to be able to realize you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 same creole optics so he will make you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 aluminum wires in mm a forceps 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.230
 cutting and round end pliers he 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 you will also need small bottles 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 so that can be a hymn that's for the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 diameter in fact so any 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 tube will do it we'll say and then 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 well glue and small rhinestones so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.620
 we will first take more or less 50 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.180
 cm 2 son aluminum tone take 40 but 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 I think 50 for the first time 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's better after when you will have 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.190
 precoumin you will see for yourself 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.629
 then we will go to heat in a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.809
 little chiffonnette so me it's a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.769
 microfiber and the fact of the pack of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 pass the film several times in the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 wipe will heat 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 our son is therefore to make it well 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 smooth but much more malleable so 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 simpler to work so then 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 we are going to put our sons well side by side 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.759
 coast and we'll take a template so there 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.380
 I took a small bottle of fimo so 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.840
 you really take what you want 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.049
 the size you want is for 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.450
 do our our our basic round 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.189
 so here I will not use the top 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 the bottom because it will slide so 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 I use the top for this very 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.229
 well flat on my table us when the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.000
 general rule me I work 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.840
 directly with both movies and there I 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 I told myself that for beginners 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.750
 would be complicated so we will proceed 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.030
 to another method 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.210
 we will see a first son 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 will surround around 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 of our from our flasks and then we 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.630
 will take the second one we will come 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 affix against the first and we will come 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.690
 also make the back so there the most 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.310
 difficult is to make sure that they 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 do not overlap one should not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 that they are one on the other but well 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
 one next to the other 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.539
 they have to follow each other to say that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.330
 the monf he's going to go over i'm you 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.470
 watch over my second one it takes 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.810
 like this for the second 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.630
 also like paul first so we 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 does our our our most form or 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.690
 less so hop I put them back well one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.310
 in the other 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.130
 so we have to fit together and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.890
 not who lather the ride I'm going 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.570
 put my bottle back and I'll give in 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.519
 all so I'm going to squeeze a little bit 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.320
 to have a global shape we get 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.610
 always be careful that it does not happen 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.600
 one on the other but that they are well 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.910
 there beside vote and serve once 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.250
 has squeezed our shape she is made 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.590
 he's just going to have lagoon and it's okay 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.330
 to be a little more complicated 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.860
 so we make sure it's fine 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.799
 flat it is well side by side 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.200
 we will return our work and we will 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.920
 come pinch with our thumb to the level 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.299
 of the join so at the level of the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.440
 the place where the sweetest sons get 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.120
 actually cross at the crossing 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.570
 whose breaks well always one to 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.489
 next to each other we check that and 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.370
 then we will come here to take our sons 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.239
 right that we will go over our 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.750
 left son up and we'll come back 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.480
 in our big circle and go around 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.739
 so we're going to make a thread by a thread 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.299
 so a first and we serve well there 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.890
 we go slowly we resume work 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.989
 if need we really need our sons 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.280
 down on cot cot and then we go 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.720
 do the same with the second is the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.450
 2nd must always be well 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.829
 affixed to the first so we will make a 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.540
 first loop like this and we go in 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.130
 do a second so as to good 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.190
 consolidate our work so 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.950
 that it does not move anymore so 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.240
 we do the second so we have to tighten 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.400
 but not too much either 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.150
 movies are done over 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.720
 really they have to be on one side 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.040
 the other one so I let you watch that 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.380
 will be simpler 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.490
 and here is the note pair of loops 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.550
 fine ears notes earrings 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.980
 hold all alone so his sons are put 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.600
 aside and we will move on to the other part 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.190
 so here I'll take the one from above 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:17.230
 and I'm going to start forming my loop 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:20.019
 who's going how can I tell you who 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.850
 will support my loop fastener 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.890
 my hook so I'm doing 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.540
 loop so there was a little too much rank 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.810
 I see it when I turn it can 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.710
 do I cut a little bit so that these are 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.880
 hands - offs that you go 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.430
 really take myself as and 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.730
 measure the diameter of your buckle 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.260
 more or less do the width of your 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.970
 bread is the widest part of 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.010
 your brush 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.740
 then we take this film there we bring it back 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.810
 to the right over our little 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.230
 loop we go back through will see another 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.150
 small loop the army so in its place 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.750
 and here we will come back to our 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.750
 big circle 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.550
 and we're going back to the other side and 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.540
 we'll do two three laps like that 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.920
 but this time we will 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.020
 do loose tricks we will not do 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.360
 tight turns is more to decorate 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.300
 the outline of our earring is 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.650
 arrived there we will simply cut 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.420
 nanny coming up with our think to 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.040
 hamburg we make a small grid but 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.300
 very very very tight so if it is 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.740
 marked pinch it does not matter 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.160
 since it will be hidden by a small 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.250
 hot gift after we are gone 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.930
 than to decorate the other part so with the 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.220
 bottom son I will redo a ride 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.010
 like the one below 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.360
 not that they are glued stuck once 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.240
 that it's done I just cut 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.060
 the surplus is I come to do a little 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.530
 very loose spiral and one makes very 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.340
 be careful not to mark our son 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.050
 we go slowly and we will make a 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.240
 second above my equal i'm going 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:54.620
 cut off the surplus and I'm going to make a 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.620
 small small spiral verrine 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.410
 and so here now is there left 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.410
 more than to put our little cabochons 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.340
 so this is a cabochon of the brand 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.520
 decopatch I put you all the links in 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:24.750
 down rhine fake as usual glue 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:28.280
 for jewelry form a small tip and 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.280
 I come to ask my little cabochons 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.030
 and let it dry we will not be left 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.380
 more than attacking the second pair so 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.000
 I show you not proceed that's 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.060
 exactly the same except that it will take 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.930
 think about reversing the meaning of the threads I 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.280
 can see a pair of curls 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.610
 I had realized just 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.680
 before and you noticed that the loss of 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.450
 left is the opposite of the pearl of the 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.840
 loss of right so it's up to you to 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.400
 think about changing the pole of all that 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:04.030
 by inspiring you from the first that 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:05.830
 you realized do not forget either 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.600
 to add small hooks to 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.250
 ear and for power the fixed and 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.990
 nicely to your flock 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.030
 so here I am I really hope this 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.950
