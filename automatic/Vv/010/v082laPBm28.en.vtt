00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.399
 welcome to a new video on the day of 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.990
 today I bring you another tour and decided to make 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.000
 a lot that does not bring them a tweet but 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.289
 finally they are here back to the channel and 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 I bring you the truth today 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.400
 that is fabulous I really liked it just 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.570
 leaving very recently was going to be a 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.010
 tweet to unlock our 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.289
 notification center device 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.119
 this click is going to call a cover and 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.589
 well let's see how it works 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.570
 As you can see, I'm here on my blog 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.890
 and the bottom tells me your court 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.119
 blog and good here is what I have to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.980
 do to unlock my device 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.350
 Well, I just have to move my blog 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.630
 as if it were a paper then I can 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.250
 handle totally dry and twix like 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.809
 but the difference this tweet is that it is 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.940
 totally manageable as you can see 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.710
 follow and fingers and any movement if 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.480
 I'm going to approach the sheet is going to go 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.340
 zoom in if I'm going upwards it's going 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.930
 upward to the side as you see it is 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.309
 totally manageable and that's what I 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.660
 love this tweet the truth that is 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.210
 great how they work 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.879
 perfectly these animations see 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.559
 how well my finger is still not that if 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.820
 I do it dry it's going to be something 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.100
 different or that will always be the same 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.690
 animation but this is going to continue my 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.610
 finger is going to be the same animation as me 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.470
 I am provoking and this is good of this 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.390
 tweet and see it as simple simply 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610
 If I want to block, I have to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 overcome some distances and 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.690
 so it's not going to unlock but I know something 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 so it's already unlocked and good as you 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.140
 I said this tweet also works in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.060
 notification center in three systems in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 our home and we try to download our 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.620
 notification center as if it were normal 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.810
 instead of doing it and down that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.160
 slide as normal does it is going to 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.350
 launch this page that is the same 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.820
 totally manageable that I can move it 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.890
 from top to bottom to the sides and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.870
 will follow my finger perfectly not 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.940
 they come jumping but it looks as if by 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.800
 back the icons were seen in 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.300
 a little more transparent then 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.610
 it works very well this is what I 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.840
 love is very realistic and good 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.880
 suppose you already have notification 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.920
 sender and who returned home is going to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.530
 work the same animation back 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.490
 then here is the animation 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.290
 logically it is the same and good as well 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.640
 simple works this tweet and good everything 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.380
 it is installed very simple so we are going to 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.700
 see how it is installed from cydia to 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.050
 install it only we have to go 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.119
 well and once we are simple we 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.280
 let's go drive in driving let's go 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 squeeze fonts what squeeze edit 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.750
 and add and there we are going to write you're 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.610
 urss which is apt point excel eyes 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.680
 dotcom once they write it they go to 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.540
 press add font after we go 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.550
 to search and we will look for concord 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.740
 we select the one from the uip or from excel 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.030
 if we press install and confirm and 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.380
 good in the same package will come 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.060
 the two clicks so there's no 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.500
 problem of which one works and one 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.850
 it was not your tweet I hope there is 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 liked if you liked one of these two 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.970
 wallpaper because I know that whenever I do not 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.630
 have I will leave the links in the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.310
 description 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.310
