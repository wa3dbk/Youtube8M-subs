lot of focus for quite some time now in

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
lot of focus for quite some time now in
the<00:00:24.420> health<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.289> wellness<00:00:25.470> communities

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the health and wellness communities

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.099 
the health and wellness communities
around<00:00:26.609> sugar<00:00:27.740> there<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.130> key<00:00:29.519> wisdom<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
around sugar there is some key wisdom to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.520 
around sugar there is some key wisdom to
understand<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.790> body<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
understand about your body in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
understand about your body in
relationship<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.559> sugar<00:00:34.920> which<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.969> rarely

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
relationship to sugar which is rarely

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.389 
relationship to sugar which is rarely
talked<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> metal<00:00:38.940> communities<00:00:39.540> or

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
talked about in the metal communities or

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
talked about in the metal communities or
the<00:00:41.399> natural<00:00:41.850> health<00:00:42.059> community<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.780> that's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the natural health community so that's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
the natural health community so that's
what<00:00:43.079> we're<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> focus<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.129> today

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
what we're going to focus on here today

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.049 
what we're going to focus on here today
so<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> first<00:00:46.829> area<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.850> focus

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so the first area we're going to focus

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
so the first area we're going to focus
on<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.700> endocrine<00:00:51.300> system<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.750> adrenal

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
on is the endocrine system the adrenal

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
on is the endocrine system the adrenal
glands<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> nervous<00:00:53.399> system<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.699> we're

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
glands the nervous system so when we're

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.599 
glands the nervous system so when we're
in<00:00:57.239> our<00:00:57.420> life<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.850> constantly

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
in our life we are constantly

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.030 
in our life we are constantly
experiencing<00:01:02.609> different<00:01:02.850> levels<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.040> stress

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
experiencing different levels of stress

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.280 
experiencing different levels of stress
and<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.630> our<00:01:06.659> entire<00:01:07.320> body<00:01:07.740> ecosystem<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
and so our entire body ecosystem is

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.130 
and so our entire body ecosystem is
responding<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> stress<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> stimulus

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
responding to this stress the stimulus

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.719 
responding to this stress the stimulus
and<00:01:14.240> acclimating<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:16.280> adjusting<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and acclimating and adjusting and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.469 
and acclimating and adjusting and
modulating<00:01:18.720> itself<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:20.180> relationship<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> our

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
modulating itself in relationship to our

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
modulating itself in relationship to our
life<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.439> our<00:01:23.009> choices<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:24.030> life<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> our

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
life and our choices in life and our

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.380 
life and our choices in life and our
experiences<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.140> our<00:01:25.259> day-to-day<00:01:25.409> life<00:01:26.390> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
experiences in our day-to-day life so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.899 
experiences in our day-to-day life so
especially<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.350> today's<00:01:28.740> life<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.520> are

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
especially in today's life where we are

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.170 
especially in today's life where we are
experiencing<00:01:30.750> more<00:01:31.710> stress<00:01:32.670> than<00:01:32.880> we've<00:01:33.030> ever

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
experiencing more stress than we've ever

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990 
experiencing more stress than we've ever
experienced<00:01:34.049> before<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.670> body

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
experienced before and so our body

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.100 
experienced before and so our body
responds<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> whether<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.070> something

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
responds to this whether it's something

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.929 
responds to this whether it's something
as<00:01:40.110> simple<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.040> stressful<00:01:41.310> thought<00:01:41.610> or

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
as simple as a stressful thought or

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.020 
as simple as a stressful thought or
something<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.049> significant<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.030> an

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
something more significant as an

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
something more significant as an
accident<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.610> something<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.090> nature

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
accident or something of this nature

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.550 
accident or something of this nature
which<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.159> illicit<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:52.170> nervous

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
which all of these illicit the nervous

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
which all of these illicit the nervous
system<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.430> respond<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.619> then<00:01:55.619> elicits<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
system to respond which then elicits the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.780 
system to respond which then elicits the
endocrine<00:01:57.689> system<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.369> adrenal<00:01:59.369> glands<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
endocrine system the adrenal glands to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.990 
endocrine system the adrenal glands to
respond<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> key<00:02:01.740> thing<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.189> understand

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
respond and so a key thing to understand

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.590 
respond and so a key thing to understand
here<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.540> what<00:02:04.409> happens<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.759> endocrine

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
here is what happens in the endocrine

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.410 
here is what happens in the endocrine
system<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> adrenal<00:02:08.310> glands<00:02:08.700> they

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
system and the adrenal glands they

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.290 
system and the adrenal glands they
modulate<00:02:09.750> most<00:02:10.590> all<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> hormone

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
modulate most all the hormone

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.760 
modulate most all the hormone
fats<00:02:13.680> proteins<00:02:14.700> carbohydrates<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:16.660> your<00:02:17.410> body

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
fats proteins carbohydrates in your body

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.160 
fats proteins carbohydrates in your body
and<00:02:18.069> turn<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.209> energy<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.950> glucose<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and turn this energy in to glucose so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.330 
and turn this energy in to glucose so
when<00:02:23.500> you're<00:02:23.890> experiencing<00:02:24.850> stress<00:02:26.340> what

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
when you're experiencing stress what

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.900 
when you're experiencing stress what
occurs<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.830> adrenaline<00:02:29.910> adrenaline

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
occurs is is adrenaline adrenaline

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.790 
occurs is is adrenaline adrenaline
elevates<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.850> then<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.120> help<00:02:34.570> modulate<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
elevates and then to help modulate the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.930 
elevates and then to help modulate the
adrenaline<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:38.040> cortisol<00:02:39.040> comes<00:02:39.520> in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
adrenaline then cortisol comes in

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.850 
adrenaline then cortisol comes in
cortisol<00:02:40.720> spikes<00:02:41.140> cortisol<00:02:41.770> elevates<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
cortisol spikes cortisol elevates and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.550 
cortisol spikes cortisol elevates and
then<00:02:44.860> what<00:02:45.160> comes<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.330> respond<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
then what comes in to respond to and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.580 
then what comes in to respond to and
help<00:02:47.739> modulate<00:02:47.980> these<00:02:48.730> spikes<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.590> adrenaline

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
help modulate these spikes in adrenaline

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.720 
help modulate these spikes in adrenaline
cortisol<00:02:51.250> an<00:02:51.730> insulin<00:02:52.600> comes<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.530> all<00:02:54.190> of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
cortisol an insulin comes in and all of

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.940 
cortisol an insulin comes in and all of
these<00:02:55.209> just<00:02:55.780> three<00:02:56.110> hormones<00:02:56.530> i<00:02:56.680> mean<00:02:56.800> there's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
these just three hormones i mean there's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.880 
these just three hormones i mean there's
many<00:02:57.130> other<00:02:57.220> hormones<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.300> will<00:02:59.110> come<00:02:59.440> into

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
many other hormones that will come into

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.890 
many other hormones that will come into
play<00:03:00.190> here<00:03:00.220> depending<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.239> qualities<00:03:01.750> and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
play here depending on the qualities and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.110 
play here depending on the qualities and
the<00:03:01.989> nature<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.160> stress<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.760> you're

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the nature of the stress that you're

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.180 
the nature of the stress that you're
experiencing<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:04.959> what<00:03:05.080> happens<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.890> is

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
experiencing but what happens is is

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.650 
experiencing but what happens is is
there<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.750> very<00:03:08.290> complex<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.660> real

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
there is a very complex and real

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.550 
there is a very complex and real
physical<00:03:13.019> transference<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:15.120> emittance<00:03:16.120> of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
physical transference and emittance of

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.000 
physical transference and emittance of
glucose<00:03:17.560> sugar<00:03:18.989> happening<00:03:19.989> when<00:03:20.590> these

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
glucose sugar happening when these

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.140 
glucose sugar happening when these
hormones<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.620> spiked<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:24.010> out<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.610> balance

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
hormones are spiked and out of balance

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.460 
hormones are spiked and out of balance
so<00:03:26.079> if<00:03:26.230> we're<00:03:26.440> stressed<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.400> even<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.480> subtle

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
so if we're stressed on even a subtle

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.940 
so if we're stressed on even a subtle
level<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.100> especially<00:03:30.459> significant<00:03:31.360> levels

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
level and especially significant levels

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.620 
level and especially significant levels
you<00:03:32.950> know<00:03:33.100> throughout<00:03:33.489> our<00:03:33.880> day<00:03:34.209> throughout

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630

our life consistently in our life here

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.650 
our life consistently in our life here
is<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:38.610> specific<00:03:39.610> view<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.480> sugar<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:43.299> when<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
is a specific view of sugar so when the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.100 
is a specific view of sugar so when the
adrenaline<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:45.250> cortisol<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.480> insulin

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
adrenaline the cortisol and the insulin

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.170 
adrenaline the cortisol and the insulin
are<00:03:47.350> all<00:03:47.680> doing<00:03:48.250> their<00:03:48.430> thing<00:03:50.340> sugar<00:03:51.340> becomes

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
are all doing their thing sugar becomes

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.630 
are all doing their thing sugar becomes
very<00:03:53.790> imbalanced<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.280> what's<00:03:57.489> not

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
very imbalanced and this is what's not

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.340 
very imbalanced and this is what's not
talked<00:03:57.910> about<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.239> whole<00:03:58.510> lot<00:03:58.720> there's<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.140> lot

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
talked about a whole lot there's a lot

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.850 
talked about a whole lot there's a lot
of<00:03:59.380> focus<00:03:59.680> on<00:04:00.600> dietary<00:04:01.600> which<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:02.290> important

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
of focus on dietary which is important

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.430 
of focus on dietary which is important
so<00:04:03.790> many<00:04:03.970> people<00:04:04.209> are<00:04:04.630> eating<00:04:04.810> what's<00:04:05.230> called

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
so many people are eating what's called

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.710 
so many people are eating what's called
the<00:04:05.500> standard<00:04:05.890> American<00:04:06.340> diet<00:04:06.370> or<00:04:07.360> what<00:04:07.690> I

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
the standard American diet or what I

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.590 
the standard American diet or what I
call<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.109> synthetic<00:04:08.350> diet<00:04:08.890> which<00:04:09.760> are<00:04:10.060> foods

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
call the synthetic diet which are foods

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.430 
call the synthetic diet which are foods
that<00:04:10.870> are<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.980> natural<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:13.720> creates<00:04:14.200> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
that are not natural and that creates a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.140 
that are not natural and that creates a
certain<00:04:14.680> experience<00:04:15.519> in<00:04:15.730> our<00:04:15.940> body<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:18.150> sugar

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
certain experience in our body and sugar

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.430 
certain experience in our body and sugar
is<00:04:19.450> important<00:04:20.109> sugar<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.590> nests

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
is important sugar is nests

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.390 
is important sugar is nests
sorry<00:04:21.830> our<00:04:22.550> body<00:04:22.850> needs<00:04:23.360> sugar<00:04:24.100> important<00:04:25.100> to

people are in a state of adrenal fatigue

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.590 
people are in a state of adrenal fatigue
it's<00:05:15.620> very<00:05:15.980> common<00:05:16.490> today<00:05:16.640> or<00:05:17.030> what<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.300> call

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
it's very common today or what I call

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.050 
it's very common today or what I call
collective<00:05:18.440> adrenal<00:05:18.980> fatigue<00:05:19.130> we're

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
collective adrenal fatigue we're

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.240 
collective adrenal fatigue we're
bombarded<00:05:20.870> with<00:05:21.020> more<00:05:21.650> stress<00:05:21.980> than<00:05:22.100> we've

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
bombarded with more stress than we've

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.320 
bombarded with more stress than we've
ever<00:05:22.400> experienced<00:05:23.180> before<00:05:23.240> so<00:05:23.810> sugar<00:05:24.320> is

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
ever experienced before so sugar is

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.770 
ever experienced before so sugar is
constantly<00:05:26.330> being<00:05:26.720> released<00:05:27.290> and<00:05:27.590> modulated

constantly being released and modulated
no<00:05:29.780> matter<00:05:29.990> what<00:05:30.380> we<00:05:30.590> eat<00:05:30.890> in<00:05:31.250> our<00:05:32.060> body<00:05:32.300> and

no matter what we eat in our body and

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.090 
no matter what we eat in our body and
then<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.280> add<00:05:34.520> into<00:05:35.150> it<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.930> choices<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:36.860> we

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
then you add into it the choices that we

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.900 
then you add into it the choices that we
make<00:05:37.490> as<00:05:37.669> far<00:05:37.940> as<00:05:38.120> food<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.990> fuel<00:05:39.910> just

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
make as far as food and fuel just

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.950 
make as far as food and fuel just
totally<00:05:41.419> turns<00:05:41.690> it<00:05:41.960> into<00:05:42.140> a<00:05:42.320> whole<00:05:42.890> other

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960
