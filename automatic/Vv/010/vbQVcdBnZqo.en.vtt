00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.259
 in house 3 that ends its numbering 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.259
 of the house 3 762 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.320
 62 because the 14 good year 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 like this person who has this house 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.399
 what about the people who have the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.530
 other names there is a number that is 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 negative the next one always said that the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.760
 most negative number is the number 4 that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 closes but next year 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.820
 strangely enter number 9 since 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.680
 also unstable unstable mario 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 white but that means a house a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.610
 department that ends in 4 ends the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.160
 9 obviate for example someone who lives 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.710
 in the number 1 of the egg 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.350
 in the number 91 that is going to be a person 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.689
 that if you think about change not good that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.869
 ment puts 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:17.130
 and think about new relationships is not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.750
 Good to have at four and I 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 I've always said that you have to close them 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.460
 already and nine houses next year with 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.460
 two points above and two points below are 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 the candidate houses whose numbering 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.740
 part in nine and four and four have 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:46.049
 to call the numbers because they are houses 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:48.509
 complicated up there and the houses 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.520
 four always where is 4 by 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.360
 example if someone lives in 24 that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.360
 Attacks the woman 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.189
 a question that happens for people who 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 lives in condominium that has one of 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.729
 general numbering for eight houses 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.459
 example inside when millions by the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.730
 distant house has a letter or another 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:12.750
 number 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.750
 the house looks and they go back 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:24.550
 it does not matter if the four letters are the same 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.740
 that close it immediately talks about 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.200
 this white secret that is closed and I 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640
 I live in the house you say that in the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.490
 Numbering from outside the house we put 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.440
 good good and took off so not with 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.540
 we have protection against this 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.750
 side which closes the number already in the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.410
 background what I do with the number what 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.340
 perfectly framed all the people who 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.840
 end in the empty a toxa or the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.850
 house has to lock him up with 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.130
 little dots around the battery with 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.950
 I 9 is also a woman love would put 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.990
 point and it came out is it is so accurate 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.350
 in numerology that is once a 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.910
 house and for example I the other day outside 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.950
 in a house that had the following 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:12.960
 number 46 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.910
 46 39 the shot I told the shot a death 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.310
 that affected the family to a family 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.550
 united but that was destabilized and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.950
 then asked the runner is 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.220
 that in this house and he told me you do not know that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.720
 He told me the husband died and the family 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.840
 scattered but look fulfilled 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.370
 the thing about grace they have two super numbers 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.030
 bad that had talked towers have the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.560
 4 and 9 to 11 and 11 to 11 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.010
 people asking me for flavor time 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.430
 day 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:49.230
 in the house if jack and who lives in that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.800
 apartment that the boss in the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.000
 house the woman and the woman goes to work 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.040
 very much more have a life of men 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.100
 is going to have a bit of a man's life in 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.540
 he names me but in turn they are going to 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.540
 like to man will send us 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.160
 a sick cat 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.790
 but I know it would be a good number to 11 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.760
 for man even better number than for 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.730
 women and talking to me about this number 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.010
 it's going to happen but the question of 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.630
 million what would be the best number to 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.970
 point that is not could invent what 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.840
 to place in the house where a baby 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.840
 but he did not answer me now
