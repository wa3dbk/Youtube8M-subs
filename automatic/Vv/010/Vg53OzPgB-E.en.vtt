00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.400
 santa and sport fans 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
 prepare for the first of the four 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.179
 duels of the month of March 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 owners of the last feel of the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 State Petro squander 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 confidence in victory 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.150
 to win the four all 2 to 0 with 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 sure the parish continues but until 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 who accepts the tie in the first round 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.760
 Maybe I did not even want to win this game already. 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 which will tie at least 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.560
 already the red blacks just think of returning 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.769
 the hard blows that led from the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.840
 opponent let's discount all she talks 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.980
 which we took one of the previous years to 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.980
 to win him in the rue 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 only the gugu means the whistle and begins to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.789
 players fight in the field more calm 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.239
 cassiano did not mean it is like this 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.239
 literally 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.200
 the sport does not waste time studying 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:00.160
 opponent five minutes and felipe azevedo 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.160
 hits a crusader at angle 1 to 0 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.010
 the other is the chance to respond with 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.010
 straight but go straight 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:25.320
 then the island team decides to impress 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 boots the santa on the ropes when the defense 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.370
 low guard 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.370
 patrick beats for goal 2 to 0 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.150
 the tricolors still use them one more 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 Philip 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.450
 3 to 0 the hurricane azevedo that the replay until 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.070
 already showed in the ring going around 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.570
 up on the lawns 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.120
 we have good moments and we 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.310
 bad times and today is a good time 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.160
 What I'm living is for these two 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.450
 goals in the form that was the first time is 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.630
 almost a knockout of the sport only 45 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.630
 minutes of a game seems set if in 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.990
 2013 only the tricolors had joys 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.780
 in the classic of the crowds the sport seems 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.890
 willing to build a story 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.290
 completely different 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 the clashes this year the saint tries 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.400
 lift your head and keep fighting 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.400
 but if there is fair work in heading 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.940
 warrior lÃ©o gamalho insists try a 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.520
 other 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.800
 almost hit a stroke of honor but it's 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.670
 cardinal who protects the saint from a 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.670
 against heavy attack 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.680
 the tricolor left the field injured but 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.390
 promises reaction 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.640
 we are hurt we are happy but 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.860
 We 're not dead, I'm sure. 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.269
 this will mean a very 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.910
 positive for us 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.069
 the course of the competition because at that 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.160
 is already ahead for the sport to order 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.260
 is to keep hitting the next 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.090
 fight rounds 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.099
 strategy if you press the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 the beginning mainly in a game like 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.299
 this home is you getting strong 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.680
 marking on them up to bring the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.170
 twisted together right? 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.569
 and we come in with this proposal and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.099
 requested with the goals did not go out today 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.980
 the goals came out 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.769
 It's in a normal way they were happening. 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.010
 and then only after also managed the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.010
 scoreboard
