00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.199
 or the tournament organizer 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.910
 in this case we have only one and it is 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.370
 the establishment of we have that we use 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.799
 for this presentation that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.200
 establishment of we have only 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.680

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 exactly the soccer tournament 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.650
 the Argentine championship in this case what 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.900
 what we are seeing is 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.730
 the page where all the players of 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.790
 football they will access to see the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.800
 statistics of the same in this case it 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.010
 has entered only the information of 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.530
 the date 16 the date that has passed the 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.620
 Weekend of June 3 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.900
 the site consists of four sections 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.520
 very important one is the access to 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.510
 the statistics that is that of the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.180
 left another is the section of the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.050
 establishment or tournament organizer 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.860
 and another section where they are reported 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.350
 news 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.080
 for example suspension of the date on 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.020
 equipment of the moment what you want 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.050
 inform the players of the tournament and 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.530
 here below the date information 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.100
 to say so current and next of the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.200
 tournament 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:19.450
 in this case as you notice here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.790
 we are on the date 16 yes and the date 17 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 as you also see this burden of the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.000
 information from point equipment 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.880
 first as I had previously told you 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.540
 let's go to an example let's go and the table 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.540
 of positions 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.600
 the standings only reflects 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.940
 what of the date 16 which is the only date 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.950
 that we have entered in the information in 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.330
 this case we see that there is only very 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.790
 few teams that have three points 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.060
 and some that have one and the others 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.960
 they have zero here you see how it was 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.150
 were the results of the date 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.940
 and would review the results of the date 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.660
 could determine exactly what has 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.660
 happened here 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.110
 if you want to see more information 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.420
 about what happened in a match 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.420
 you can go to match tab 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.630
 in this case, well, I did not mention them but 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.360
 there are sections where you can 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.870
 go and look for information in a more 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.000
 precise in this case group group says 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.550
 unique because because Argentine tournament is 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.800
 composed by a single group to say so 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.230
 of 20 teams where everyone plays against 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.930
 everyone in this case I told him that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:48.160
 we had entered everything concerning 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.840
 to date 16 yes and the phase is the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.880
 closing why because we can 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.530
 configure it also so you have the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.870
 closing and opening 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.130
 in this case if we go and we click 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.819
 for example in the match of tiger san 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.819
 martín de san juan 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.100
 shows us all the information of what 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.340
 what happened in the match in this 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.560
 case this you see here are the scores 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.960
 that he has given the newspaper twice to 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.550
 players this match has ended 3 a 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.690
 1 and here you see all the information 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.210
 detailed of what has happened in the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.090
 match that information is loaded with two 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.240
 simple fichitas in excel that you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.260
 they import into the system and automatically 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.450
 feeds the entire system to 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.610
 provide it with statistics in this 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.570
 case the good arbitration was from rafael and 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.960
 nor the figure was Carlos I think and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.510
 this the admonished good appliances and 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.610
 Garcia and the goals of Gastón Díaz I think and 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.610
 riaño and caprari for 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.180
 for san martín san juan perón so 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.980
 good you only entered 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.570
 fichitas with him what happens in the 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.850
 party and automatically feeds 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.840
 the whole system another example is by 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.840
 example of goal scorers 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.539

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.879
 upload the image of each of the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.889
 tournament players and automatically to 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:18.639
 as it goes by 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.129
 is going from one player to another in goals 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.039
 automatically you see the information of 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.560
 that player and his photo for example here 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.210

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.370
 as the only player who made two goals 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.499
 in a match was claudio riano is 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.249
