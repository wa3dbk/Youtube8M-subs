00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.490
 good hello guys this time 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.440
 we bring another video tutorial of them les 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.070
 I'm going to teach how to unpack 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.600
 to them 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.140
 First of all, we're going to need 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.340
 application called ai file in this the 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.500
 can find in the repository 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.080
 development in any case and we have used 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.230
 in other videos but I'll leave them 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.180
 in the description and well once the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.280
 more normal discharge like all 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.540
 applications we will look like the icon 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.890
 on our desk so to speak 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.890
 let's open the application 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.760
 and for example in case of which 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.580
 you have some downloaded file 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.200
 it is just to click and it will come out 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.559
 the option of if we want to extract the water 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.360
 give an example me for example where I use 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.730
 more the rar files sell being in 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.340
 applying mega for example just 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.490
 download this cat folder data from the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.440
 world 4.3 we go to the ones we have 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.480
 downloaded web data point 3 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.160
 and as you can see, you can not 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.200
 see anything in this application because it is a 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.040
 rar file what we are going to do 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.170
 then it is to give here in the icon to the 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 upper right corner of the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 share 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.270
 and how can you see to hear the icon of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 open there file we apply 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 we hope that there will be 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.570
 and we do not give it in zip viewer 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 hopefully they are known as the can 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.719
 see here shows us all the data that 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.170
 the data has let's say if there are several 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.170
 we select all 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.240
 point 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.980
 against 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.290
 and in the lower right corner is the 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.860
 unpack icon we give you be on 20 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.200
 archives 6 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.849
 unpacking files 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.849
 we hope we hope we wait 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.130
 let's see ok and as you can see here is the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.650
 rar file in documents I'm 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:36.800
 overcoming the default page of the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 live and as you can see here so a 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.640
 new folder with game data 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.920
 in 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.020
 this is an example of an example 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.810
 example if they download some movie 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.790
 some series and what do I know or some up 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.770
 a music that you who is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.160
 compressed you just download it 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.600
 by media or by some other application 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.750
 download manager that has the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.459
 option to share in with this one just what 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.010
 you open with live and unzip it if you already 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.540
 that they will be in which has a 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.850
 great variety of options for example 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.400
 to avoid let's say we select battle in 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.230
 the point of vÃ©lez and here is the icon 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.620
 to copy in the lower right corner 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.610
 to send bluetooth and by mail 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.610
 delete it and return it to pack 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.760
 it is a very very application 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.959
 how to say useful can you can 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.819
 change the name of the file 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.020
 directory here shows it to you 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.150
 exactly to hell exactly what 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.520
 is part of the memory your cell phone is 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.200
 gives you options to open with those who do 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.739
 you want to open it with text views pdf 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.739
 Web 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.890
 and it gives you a very good description of 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.460
 same 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.990
 we have 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.540
 Well, I think it would be toxic 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.760
 it's a very simple saying one side because 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.470
 it's not the great science just downloading 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 the app 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.250
 file and be good loser then any 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.430
 doubt leave in a box of comments 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.830
 in like they are written and if they need 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.620
 a video especially not hesitate to 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.650
 comment but how are we on vacation 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.949
 and I am willing to make videos 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.150
 faster and with more time so then 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.150
 thank you, chau
