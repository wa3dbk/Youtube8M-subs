00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
exactly it to the T but this is the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.520 
exactly it to the T but this is the
closest<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.860> so

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
closest that I could get to it so

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.399 
closest that I could get to it so
basically<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.950> purchased<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> RiRi<00:02:03.240> Lu<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.259> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
purchased it because I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.620 
purchased it because I
at<00:02:08.220> least<00:02:08.399> how<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> collection<00:02:08.820> looked<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.539> I
