00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it deserves a review as of now because

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.270 
it deserves a review as of now because
the<00:00:38.550> apps<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> uses<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:40.170> App<00:00:40.350> Store<00:00:41.070> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
slash apps that actually do work very

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
slash apps that actually do work very
well<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.140> Google<00:01:25.380> cardboard<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.369> mainly

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
well with Google cardboard and mainly

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
well with Google cardboard and mainly
most<00:01:27.210> apps<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> work<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.110> other<00:01:28.290> things

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
most apps that work with other things

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800 
most apps that work with other things
like<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.009> oculus<00:01:29.729> rift<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.450> other<00:01:30.600> things

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
like the oculus rift and other things
like<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.049> mainly<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.040> probably<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:32.579> with

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
like that mainly will probably work with

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
like that mainly will probably work with
this<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this as well but the thing that you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.780 
this as well but the thing that you
probably<00:01:34.799> would<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.369> most<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
probably would need for most of the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
probably would need for most of the
games<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> App<00:01:36.299> Store<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.110> Bluetooth

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
games on the App Store is a Bluetooth

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.109 
games on the App Store is a Bluetooth
controller<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.430> something<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> can

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
controller or something that you can

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
controller or something that you can
make<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> game<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:40.409> most<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
make to the game because most of the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.190 
make to the game because most of the
games<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.150> shadow<00:01:42.450> gun<00:01:42.720> games<00:01:42.990> they

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
games like the shadow gun games they

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
games like the shadow gun games they
have<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.640> walk

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
have on here you can actually walk

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
have on here you can actually walk
around<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> need<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> controller<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.649> do

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
around but you need a controller to do

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.319 
around but you need a controller to do
that<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> on

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that so you can actually use that on

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
that so you can actually use that on
here<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> can't<00:01:49.140> move<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
here but you can't move so that's the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.710 
here but you can't move so that's the
downfall<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.479> downfall

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
downfall but it's really not a downfall

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.050 
downfall but it's really not a downfall
on<00:01:52.170> Google<00:01:52.500> cardboard<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.790> something

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
on Google cardboard it's just something

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
on Google cardboard it's just something
that<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> need<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.810> separate<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> enjoy

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that you need to get separate to enjoy

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
that you need to get separate to enjoy
your<00:01:56.159> games<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.299> anything

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
your games but it's not really anything

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.319 
your games but it's not really anything
wrong<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.229> Google<00:01:58.530> cardboard<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.729> side

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
wrong with Google cardboard on that side

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.030 
wrong with Google cardboard on that side
I'm<00:02:00.450> actually<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.899> do<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> quick<00:02:01.530> test<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
I'm actually gonna do a quick test of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
I'm actually gonna do a quick test of
app<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.820> show<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.240> how<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> basically<00:02:03.930> works

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
app and show you how it basically works

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.499 
app and show you how it basically works
so<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:04.979> real<00:02:05.189> life<00:02:05.399> test<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.360> how

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
so you can see in real life test of how

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
so you can see in real life test of how
it<00:02:06.630> works<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.140> gonna<00:02:07.350> start<00:02:07.590> recording<00:02:07.710> my

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069

it works so I'm gonna start recording my
screen<00:02:08.129> now<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.599> into<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
screen now and I'm going to go into the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.020 
screen now and I'm going to go into the
VR<00:02:10.200> toilet<00:02:10.950> simulator<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.580> give<00:02:11.730> you

VR toilet simulator to give you
quick<00:02:12.150> test<00:02:12.420> okay<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.050> I'm<00:02:13.260> using<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> 1+1<00:02:14.340> and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
quick test okay so I'm using the 1+1 and

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.920 
quick test okay so I'm using the 1+1 and
tested<00:02:14.819> after<00:02:14.970> actually<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.630> Google

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
tested after actually the Google

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.449 
tested after actually the Google
cardboard<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.709> right<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.340> not

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
cardboard that I have right now is not

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.610 
cardboard that I have right now is not
actually<00:02:18.030> fitted<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.660> use<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.080> oneplus<00:02:19.410> one

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
actually fitted to use the oneplus one

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
actually fitted to use the oneplus one
because<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> oneplus<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> big<00:02:21.060> phone

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
because the oneplus one is a big phone

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.270 
because the oneplus one is a big phone
but<00:02:21.990> they<00:02:22.080> actually<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.770> released<00:02:22.920> the

but they actually just released the
Excel<00:02:23.790> version<00:02:23.819> because<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> got<00:02:24.600> mine<00:02:24.840> off<00:02:25.080> of

Excel version because I got mine off of
ebay<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.400> was<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> normal<00:02:27.060> version

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
ebay but this was the normal version

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.059 
ebay but this was the normal version
they<00:02:27.480> actually<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.230> released<00:02:28.470> an

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
they actually just released an

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.890 
they actually just released an
extra-large<00:02:29.580> version<00:02:30.030> after<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.450> already

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900

what it's called but basically the

having<00:06:32.280> to<00:06:32.460> hold<00:06:32.700> it<00:06:32.970> which<00:06:33.360> i<00:06:33.510> think<00:06:33.540> would<00:06:33.810> be

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
having to hold it which i think would be

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.350 
having to hold it which i think would be
really<00:06:33.990> cool<00:06:34.320> and<00:06:34.650> then<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:34.800> can<00:06:34.980> actually

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
really cool and then I can actually

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.670 
really cool and then I can actually
have<00:06:35.509> a<00:06:35.539> controller<00:06:36.020> which<00:06:36.229> I<00:06:36.319> was<00:06:36.439> thinking

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
have a controller which I was thinking

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.189 
have a controller which I was thinking
about<00:06:36.740> going<00:06:37.189> getting<00:06:37.729> a<00:06:37.879> door<00:06:38.090> lock<00:06:38.330> for<00:06:38.599> ps4

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
about going getting a door lock for ps4

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.200 
about going getting a door lock for ps4
controller<00:06:39.620> and<00:06:39.949> playing<00:06:40.460> some<00:06:40.639> games<00:06:40.849> do<00:06:41.090> it

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
controller and playing some games do it

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.089 
controller and playing some games do it
like<00:06:41.389> that<00:06:41.599> but<00:06:41.870> what<00:06:42.289> I<00:06:42.319> really<00:06:42.620> hope<00:06:42.770> for<00:06:42.830> is

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
like that but what I really hope for is

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:45.429 
like that but what I really hope for is
that<00:06:43.189> more<00:06:43.939> developers<00:06:44.509> make<00:06:44.719> more<00:06:44.960> apps<00:06:45.199> for

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:45.439 
that more developers make more apps for

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:47.350 
that more developers make more apps for
Google<00:06:45.620> cardboard<00:06:46.039> to<00:06:46.759> work<00:06:46.939> on<00:06:47.120> the<00:06:47.210> App

it<00:07:01.610> out<00:07:01.879> it<00:07:02.270> was<00:07:02.419> a<00:07:02.449> good<00:07:02.689> first<00:07:02.930> experience

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
it out it was a good first experience

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.399 
it out it was a good first experience
for<00:07:03.710> virtual<00:07:04.280> reality<00:07:04.849> gaming<00:07:05.539> and<00:07:05.930> stuff

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:06.409 
for virtual reality gaming and stuff

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:08.830 
for virtual reality gaming and stuff
like<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:06.919> I<00:07:07.159> feel<00:07:07.669> is<00:07:07.789> riff<00:07:08.000> it<00:07:08.210> may<00:07:08.479> be<00:07:08.539> more

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
like that I feel is riff it may be more

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.230 
like that I feel is riff it may be more
professional<00:07:09.439> but<00:07:09.590> this<00:07:09.830> thing<00:07:10.009> is<00:07:10.189> cheap<00:07:10.879> so

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
professional but this thing is cheap so

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.290 
professional but this thing is cheap so
it's<00:07:11.779> Google<00:07:12.620> just<00:07:12.740> shows<00:07:12.979> how<00:07:13.279> easy<00:07:13.849> it<00:07:14.120> was

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
it's Google just shows how easy it was

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.800 
it's Google just shows how easy it was
to<00:07:14.330> I<00:07:14.840> guess<00:07:15.349> make<00:07:16.340> this<00:07:16.550> and<00:07:16.969> probably<00:07:17.449> I

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
to I guess make this and probably I

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.839 
to I guess make this and probably I
think<00:07:18.620> they're<00:07:18.710> asking<00:07:18.860> for<00:07:19.219> more<00:07:19.340> developers

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:19.849 
think they're asking for more developers

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:21.490 
think they're asking for more developers
to<00:07:20.029> something<00:07:20.419> but<00:07:20.599> I<00:07:20.750> don't<00:07:20.960> want<00:07:21.080> to<00:07:21.139> bramble
