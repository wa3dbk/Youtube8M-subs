00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
between mine and there's mine goes under

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.100 
between mine and there's mine goes under
the<00:04:55.460> sea<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:55.880> it's<00:04:56.120> not<00:04:56.360> seater<00:04:56.720> so<00:04:57.050> it

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
the sea but it's not seater so it

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.900 
the sea but it's not seater so it
doesn't<00:04:57.350> look<00:04:57.470> cool<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.010> it's<00:04:58.550> wired<00:04:58.729> with

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
doesn't look cool and it's wired with

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.570 
doesn't look cool and it's wired with
explosives<00:04:59.710> seriously<00:05:00.710> I'll<00:05:01.070> show<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
explosives seriously I'll show you it

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.909 
explosives seriously I'll show you it
sometime<00:05:01.610> it's<00:05:02.419> wired<00:05:02.990> from<00:05:03.229> exposed<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.800> the

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
sometime it's wired from exposed to the

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.980 
sometime it's wired from exposed to the
tippy<00:05:04.190> top<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.610> my<00:05:04.729> ice<00:05:04.970> crown<00:05:05.300> stood<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.750> tell

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
tippy top of my ice crown stood to tell

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.520 
tippy top of my ice crown stood to tell
made<00:05:06.919> frog<00:05:07.250> kind<00:05:08.120> of<00:05:08.330> snot<00:05:09.080> even<00:05:09.320> close

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
made frog kind of snot even close

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.680 
made frog kind of snot even close
similar<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> world<00:05:10.280> of<00:05:10.400> warcraft<00:05:10.669> lich<00:05:11.390> king

thing<00:05:11.990> but<00:05:12.550> yeah<00:05:13.550> i<00:05:13.580> find<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.240> vibe<00:05:14.419> from<00:05:14.750> it

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
thing but yeah i find the vibe from it

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.620 
thing but yeah i find the vibe from it
since<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.289> was<00:05:15.380> all<00:05:15.500> snip<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:16.600> defies<00:05:17.600> the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
since it was all snip that defies the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.290 
since it was all snip that defies the
laws<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.169> physics<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:19.430> thought<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.120> was<00:05:20.240> a

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
laws of physics I thought this was a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.750 
laws of physics I thought this was a
physics<00:05:20.780> game<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:24.440> know<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.740> think<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.580> might

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
physics game you know I think I might

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.240

except<00:06:21.930> for<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.139> live<00:06:22.469> servers<00:06:22.949> where<00:06:23.219> I<00:06:23.250> just

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
except for the live servers where I just

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.360 
except for the live servers where I just
go<00:06:24.030> into<00:06:24.240> people's<00:06:24.330> houses<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:25.190> steal<00:06:26.190> it

you're<00:06:28.949> wondering<00:06:29.190> what<00:06:29.580> happened<00:06:29.969> to<00:06:30.000> your

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
you're wondering what happened to your

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.850 
you're wondering what happened to your
stuff<00:06:30.270> yeah<00:06:30.449> I<00:06:30.479> probably<00:06:30.750> went<00:06:31.050> in<00:06:31.259> it<00:06:31.409> since

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
stuff yeah I probably went in it since

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.890 
stuff yeah I probably went in it since
your<00:06:32.009> server<00:06:32.400> was<00:06:32.580> live<00:06:32.849> and<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.449> stole<00:06:33.750> your

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
your server was live and I stole your

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.270 
your server was live and I stole your
stuff<00:06:34.139> and<00:06:34.379> then<00:06:34.500> burnt<00:06:34.740> your<00:06:34.830> house<00:06:35.009> to<00:06:35.190> the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280
