hello everyone and welcome in this video
we're<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> be<00:00:02.550> discussing<00:00:02.850> weight

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
we're going to be discussing weight

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.210 
we're going to be discussing weight
distribution<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.959> how<00:00:04.380> it<00:00:04.500> affects<00:00:04.799> vehicle

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
distribution and how it affects vehicle

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.190 
distribution and how it affects vehicle
dynamics<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.210> more<00:00:06.540> specifically<00:00:07.020> getting

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
dynamics and more specifically getting

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.810 
dynamics and more specifically getting
into<00:00:07.560> kind<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.919> why<00:00:08.130> certain<00:00:08.670> weight

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
into kind of why certain weight

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.700 
into kind of why certain weight
distributions<00:00:09.360> are<00:00:09.570> considered<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.469> ideal

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
distributions are considered to be ideal

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.009 
distributions are considered to be ideal
such<00:00:11.219> as<00:00:11.400> 50/50<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.210> whether<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.780> that's

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
such as 50/50 and whether or not that's

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.410 
such as 50/50 and whether or not that's
actually<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.559> case<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:15.000> order<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
actually the case and in order to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.029 
actually the case and in order to
understand<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.410> probably<00:00:16.529> important

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
understand this it's probably important

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.230 
understand this it's probably important
that<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.190> understand<00:00:17.609> slip<00:00:17.880> angles

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
that you understand slip angles

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300 
that you understand slip angles
understeer<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.199> oversteer<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.160> you're

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
understeer and oversteer so if you're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.830 
understeer and oversteer so if you're
familiar<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.939> these<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.390> may<00:00:21.600> want<00:00:21.810> to

rear you're going to have a over
steering<00:01:14.790> vehicle<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.580> everything<00:01:17.580> equal

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
steering vehicle so everything equal

the characteristics of whether it will
understeer<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.610> oversteer<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.450> purely

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
understeer or oversteer is purely

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.020 
understeer or oversteer is purely
dependent<00:01:25.619> upon<00:01:25.799> its<00:01:26.220> weight<00:01:26.430> distribution

dependent upon its weight distribution

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.800 
dependent upon its weight distribution
and<00:01:27.210> loading<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:29.150> this<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> important<00:01:30.750> because

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and loading so this is important because

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.039 
and loading so this is important because
this<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.290> where<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.829> 50/50<00:01:32.759> ideal<00:01:33.570> weight

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this is where this 50/50 ideal weight

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.530 
this is where this 50/50 ideal weight
distribution<00:01:34.590> comes<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
distribution comes from because if you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210 
distribution comes from because if you
have<00:01:36.720> half<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> weight<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.799> front<00:01:38.070> and

you're going around a corner at a
constant<00:01:42.750> speed<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> constant<00:01:43.920> radius

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
constant speed at a constant radius

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
constant speed at a constant radius
you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> neutrally

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you're going to have a neutrally

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
you're going to have a neutrally
steering<00:01:46.409> car<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> slip<00:01:47.340> angles

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
steering car because the slip angles

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
steering car because the slip angles
will<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.479> same<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.259> that's<00:01:49.439> kind<00:01:49.710> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
will be the same and so that's kind of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
will be the same and so that's kind of
the<00:01:50.070> whole<00:01:50.220> reason<00:01:50.250> why<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:51.149> has<00:01:51.270> been

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the whole reason why this thing has been

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
the whole reason why this thing has been
considered<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.110> ideal<00:01:52.259> even<00:01:52.950> though<00:01:53.100> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
considered to be ideal even though it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
considered to be ideal even though it
might<00:01:53.369> necessarily<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.899> ideal<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
might necessarily not be ideal and

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.319 
might necessarily not be ideal and
plenty<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> cars<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.610> not<00:01:56.640> use<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
plenty of cars out there do not use a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
plenty of cars out there do not use a
50/50<00:01:58.229> weight<00:01:58.350> distribution<00:01:58.530> because<00:01:59.130> there

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
50/50 weight distribution because there

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
50/50 weight distribution because there
are<00:01:59.340> benefits<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.969> moving<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> center<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
are benefits of moving that center of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
are benefits of moving that center of
gravity<00:02:01.110> back<00:02:01.649> now<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:03.030> at

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
gravity back now if you look at

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
gravity back now if you look at
basically<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.049> car<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.860> we've<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
basically a car here so we've got the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.530 
basically a car here so we've got the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
center of gravity in the center here's

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.770 
center of gravity in the center here's
the<00:02:06.659> front<00:02:06.869> tire<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.799> rear<00:02:07.979> tire<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.539> move

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the front tire the rear tire if you move

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
the front tire the rear tire if you move
that<00:02:09.810> center<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> gravity<00:02:10.410> forward<00:02:11.099> all<00:02:11.520> else

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that center of gravity forward all else

that center of gravity forward all else
being<00:02:12.330> equal<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.230> car<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
being equal the car is

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.400 
being equal the car is
to<00:02:13.830> tend<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> understeer<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:16.110> move<00:02:16.380> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
to tend to understeer if you move that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
to tend to understeer if you move that

thing<00:02:18.270> you're<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.050> you're<00:02:19.260> going

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
thing you're going to do is you're going

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
thing you're going to do is you're going
to<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.530> transferring<00:02:20.190> more<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> loading

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
to be transferring more of the loading

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.870 
to be transferring more of the loading
to<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> front<00:02:21.840> tire<00:02:22.050> under<00:02:22.380> braking<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
to the front tire under braking and so

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.820 
to the front tire under braking and so
this<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.420> mean<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.020> front<00:02:25.530> wheel

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
this is going to mean the front wheel

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830 
this is going to mean the front wheel
the<00:02:26.640> front<00:02:26.880> two<00:02:27.030> tires<00:02:27.330> are<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> be

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the front two tires are going to be

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
the front two tires are going to be
doing<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.170> vast<00:02:28.380> majority<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.100> braking

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
doing the vast majority of the braking

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.490 
doing the vast majority of the braking
now<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.900> front-wheel<00:02:31.470> drive

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
now if you do have a front-wheel drive

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.860 
now if you do have a front-wheel drive
car<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.760> move<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.120> center<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.510> gravity

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
car and you move that center of gravity

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.850 
car and you move that center of gravity
forward<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.440> you're<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.740> be

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
forward then you're going to be

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.430 
forward then you're going to be
providing<00:02:35.340> more<00:02:35.390> acceleration<00:02:36.390> traction<00:02:36.870> for

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
providing more acceleration traction for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.690 
providing more acceleration traction for
those<00:02:37.590> front<00:02:37.890> tires<00:02:38.040> because<00:02:38.400> you've<00:02:38.520> got

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
those front tires because you've got

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
those front tires because you've got
more<00:02:38.940> weight<00:02:39.150> over<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.170> limit<00:02:40.530> will<00:02:40.680> be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
more weight over it so the limit will be

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.590 
more weight over it so the limit will be
higher<00:02:41.100> at<00:02:41.370> which<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.700> can<00:02:41.880> accelerate<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
higher at which you can accelerate the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.270 
higher at which you can accelerate the
maximum<00:02:42.990> force<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.620> accelerate<00:02:43.890> with

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
maximum force you can accelerate with

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.940 
maximum force you can accelerate with
now<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.300> was<00:02:45.420> mentioning<00:02:45.570> often<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> CG<00:02:46.920> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
now as I was mentioning often the CG is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.600 
now as I was mentioning often the CG is
not<00:02:47.280> at<00:02:47.460> 5050<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.210> more<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.720> 45<00:02:49.500> 55<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.310> 40

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
not at 5050 it's more like 45 55 or 40

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.610 
not at 5050 it's more like 45 55 or 40
60<00:02:50.970> something<00:02:51.300> like<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.660> where<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.200> CG

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
60 something like that where the CG

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.250 
60 something like that where the CG
moved<00:02:52.860> back<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> bit<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.810> done<00:02:55.020> for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
moved back a bit and this is done for

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.170 
moved back a bit and this is done for
several<00:02:55.890> reasons<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.370> all<00:02:56.670> else<00:02:56.820> being<00:02:57.090> equal

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
several reasons but all else being equal

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.900 
several reasons but all else being equal
it<00:02:57.840> would<00:02:58.200> create<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> car<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.400> would<00:02:59.550> tend<00:02:59.820> to

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
it would create a car that would tend to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
it would create a car that would tend to
oversteer<00:03:00.510> however<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.290> does<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.740> other

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
oversteer however it does have other

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.310 
oversteer however it does have other
benefits<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:03.120> thing<00:03:03.330> if<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.570> move<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.870> CG

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
benefits one thing if you move that CG

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.050 
benefits one thing if you move that CG
back<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:05.040> means<00:03:05.220> your<00:03:05.430> front<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:05.970> rear

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
back that means your front and rear

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420 
back that means your front and rear
tires<00:03:06.600> are<00:03:06.960> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.410> doing<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:07.920> evenly

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
tires are going to be doing more evenly

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.510 
tires are going to be doing more evenly
loading<00:03:09.360> during<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> braking<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.130> because

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
loading during the braking so because

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.430 
loading during the braking so because
you<00:03:11.640> don't<00:03:11.820> have<00:03:11.940> as<00:03:12.090> much<00:03:12.330> load<00:03:12.870> transfer<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
you don't have as much load transfer to

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.470 
you don't have as much load transfer to
the<00:03:13.530> front<00:03:13.860> wheels<00:03:14.070> under<00:03:14.580> braking<00:03:14.820> those

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the front wheels under braking those

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.060 
the front wheels under braking those
rear<00:03:15.810> brakes<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.440> actually<00:03:16.740> do<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> good

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
rear brakes can actually do a good

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.070 
rear brakes can actually do a good
amount<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.340> work<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.300> that's<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.510> great<00:03:18.690> benefit

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
amount of work so that's a great benefit

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.110 
amount of work so that's a great benefit
of<00:03:19.140> having<00:03:19.470> your<00:03:19.560> CG<00:03:19.950> back<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> little<00:03:20.430> bit<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
of having your CG back a little bit you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.670 
of having your CG back a little bit you
also<00:03:21.330> will<00:03:21.660> obviously<00:03:21.959> have<00:03:22.230> more<00:03:22.440> traction

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
also will obviously have more traction

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.980 
also will obviously have more traction
if<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> rear-wheel<00:03:24.180> drive<00:03:24.209> vehicle

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
if you have a rear-wheel drive vehicle

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.510 
if you have a rear-wheel drive vehicle
where<00:03:25.380> you've<00:03:25.470> got<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.830> weight<00:03:26.130> over<00:03:26.310> the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
where you've got that weight over the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.110 
where you've got that weight over the
rear<00:03:26.760> tires<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:27.690> why<00:03:28.020> is<00:03:28.530> 5050<00:03:29.400> always<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
rear tires so why is 5050 always you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.580 
rear tires so why is 5050 always you
know<00:03:30.209> claimed<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.870> ideal<00:03:31.380> weight

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
know claimed to be the ideal weight

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.890 
know claimed to be the ideal weight
distribution<00:03:31.890> well<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.270> was<00:03:33.300> saying<00:03:33.420> at<00:03:33.870> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
distribution well like I was saying at a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.500 
distribution well like I was saying at a
constant<00:03:34.380> speed<00:03:34.590> going<00:03:35.490> around<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.970> constant

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
constant speed going around a constant

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.110 
constant speed going around a constant
radius<00:03:36.780> corner<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.530> car<00:03:38.070> will<00:03:38.310> steer<00:03:38.640> neutrally

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
radius corner a car will steer neutrally

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.180 
radius corner a car will steer neutrally
it<00:03:39.209> won't<00:03:39.360> understand<00:03:39.810> oversteer<00:03:40.500> ice<00:03:40.890> will

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
it won't understand oversteer ice will

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.050 
it won't understand oversteer ice will
will<00:03:41.790> behave<00:03:42.120> very<00:03:42.330> predictably<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.910> is

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
will behave very predictably and this is

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.250 
will behave very predictably and this is
kind<00:03:45.240> of<00:03:45.300> leaving<00:03:45.630> out<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> other<00:03:45.990> thing

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
kind of leaving out the other thing

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.080 
kind of leaving out the other thing
where<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.830> know<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.370> weight<00:03:47.580> centrally

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
where you know you want weight centrally

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
where you know you want weight centrally
located<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.080> your<00:03:49.230> car<00:03:49.440> has<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> lower<00:03:49.860> moment

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
located so your car has a lower moment

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.370 
located so your car has a lower moment
of<00:03:50.280> inertia<00:03:50.550> but<00:03:51.120> we're<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.630> purely<00:03:51.870> talking

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
of inertia but we're just purely talking

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.410 
of inertia but we're just purely talking
about<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.520> case<00:03:53.760> understeer<00:03:54.330> and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
about in this case understeer and

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.810 
about in this case understeer and
oversteer<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.980> mitigate<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
oversteer and you can mitigate that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.210 
oversteer and you can mitigate that
basically<00:03:57.390> with<00:03:57.959> how<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.260> place<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.920> center

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
basically with how you place your center

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.740 
basically with how you place your center
of<00:03:59.250> gravity<00:03:59.370> all<00:03:59.910> comes<00:04:00.300> down<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.510> these

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
of gravity all comes down to these

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.170 
of gravity all comes down to these
equations<00:04:01.130> which<00:04:02.130> I<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.520> derived<00:04:02.700> in

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
equations which I have derived in

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.120 
equations which I have derived in
