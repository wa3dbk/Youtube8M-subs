we're going to head back to world 2 I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.279 
we're going to head back to world 2 I
believe<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> believe<00:00:18.810> that's<00:00:19.050> where

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
believe because I believe that's where

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.400 
believe because I believe that's where
it<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.800> take<00:00:20.430> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.910> comet<00:00:21.240> star<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.779> tall

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
it is and take on the comet star of tall

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.580 
it is and take on the comet star of tall
trunk<00:00:22.800> galaxies<00:00:23.340> otherwise<00:00:24.269> known<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.990> known

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
trunk galaxies otherwise known and known

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.950 
trunk galaxies otherwise known and known
as<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.730> fearful<00:00:27.150> galaxies<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
as one of my fearful galaxies I think I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
as one of my fearful galaxies I think I
said<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> way<00:00:28.470> back<00:00:28.800> when<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> did<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> galaxy

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
said it way back when I did the galaxy

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
said it way back when I did the galaxy
the<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:30.539> time<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.320> much<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.650> hate<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the first time about how much I hate it

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
the first time about how much I hate it
but<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.780> comet<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
but it was actually the comet that I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.240 
but it was actually the comet that I
hated<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.930> like<00:00:36.930> you'll<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.620> why<00:00:37.829> because

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
hated and like you'll see why because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.819 
hated and like you'll see why because
this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.270> purple<00:00:40.079> coin<00:00:40.260> mission

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this is actually a purple coin mission

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.209 
this is actually a purple coin mission
and<00:00:41.719> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> guess<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and if you can just take a guess as to

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
and if you can just take a guess as to
where<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.670> purple<00:00:44.969> coin<00:00:45.180> mission<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.660> gonna

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
where the purple coin mission is gonna

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.010 
where the purple coin mission is gonna
be<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.320> tall<00:00:46.530> trunks<00:00:46.920> purple<00:00:47.280> coin<00:00:47.489> slide

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
be like tall trunks purple coin slide

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.430 
be like tall trunks purple coin slide
yeah<00:00:49.020> it's<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.780> only<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> have

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
yeah it's this and so not only do I have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
yeah it's this and so not only do I have
to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.710> accurate<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> get<00:00:53.789> as<00:00:53.879> many<00:00:54.059> coins<00:00:54.270> as

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to be accurate and get as many coins as

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
to be accurate and get as many coins as
possible<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> hundred<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
possible I have to get a hundred by the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
possible I have to get a hundred by the
end<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:58.109> course<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.559> there's<00:00:59.070> gonna<00:00:59.219> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
end and of course this there's gonna be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
end and of course this there's gonna be
more<00:00:59.640> than<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> hundred<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> track<00:01:00.750> because

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
more than a hundred on the track because

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.549 
more than a hundred on the track because
that's<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.250> pain<00:01:02.430> otherwise<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> I've

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
got to get a hundred coins by the end

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.260 
got to get a hundred coins by the end
and<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.229> kill<00:01:07.439> me<00:01:07.650> yep<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
for me because I am really bad at

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.260 
for me because I am really bad at
controlling<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.759> like<00:01:20.759> really

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
controlling this like really

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.600 
controlling this like really
you've<00:01:23.110> got<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.590> can't<00:01:23.829> eat<00:01:24.040> you've<00:01:24.280> got<00:01:24.490> to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
you've got you can't eat you've got to

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.580 
you've got you can't eat you've got to
be<00:01:24.700> like<00:01:24.880> quick<00:01:25.360> little<00:01:25.659> joystick<00:01:25.869> movements

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
be like quick little joystick movements

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.770 
be like quick little joystick movements
with<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.729> there's<00:01:27.939> a<00:01:28.000> lot<00:01:28.149> of<00:01:28.299> coins<00:01:28.540> right

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
with it but there's a lot of coins right

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
with it but there's a lot of coins right
there<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.200> get<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:29.590> then<00:01:30.280> there's<00:01:30.670> these<00:01:31.119> yep

it's a it's the reason that it's so
annoying<00:01:36.220> for<00:01:36.369> me<00:01:36.610> is<00:01:36.880> because<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.289> whole

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
annoying for me is because of the whole

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.100 
annoying for me is because of the whole
if<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.759> don't<00:01:39.970> make<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.210> hundred<00:01:40.479> by<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.780> time

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
if you don't make a hundred by the time

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.279 
if you don't make a hundred by the time
that<00:01:41.500> it's<00:01:41.860> ended<00:01:42.490> off<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:43.210> they<00:01:43.659> kill<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.080> I

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
that it's ended off then they kill you I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
like this is an easy comet but then

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.850 
like this is an easy comet but then
again<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.149> guess<00:01:52.450> that's<00:01:52.689> I<00:01:52.990> guess<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.649> makes

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
again I guess that's I guess that makes

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.080 
again I guess that's I guess that makes
sense<00:01:53.950> they<00:01:54.369> would<00:01:54.520> kill<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.819> because<00:01:54.909> you

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
sense they would kill you because you

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.639 
sense they would kill you because you
can't<00:01:55.270> really<00:01:55.390> go<00:01:55.539> back<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.049> get<00:01:56.200> any<00:01:56.440> more

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
can't really go back and get any more

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.510 
can't really go back and get any more
purple<00:01:57.069> coins<00:01:57.190> if<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.840> finish<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.770> without<00:01:59.950> the
