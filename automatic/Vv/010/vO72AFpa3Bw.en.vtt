classy version on back not much you can
do<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.570> though

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:04.170 

good

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:13.470 

so<00:02:04.840> as<00:02:05.650> soon<00:02:05.920> as<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.160> place<00:02:06.370> I'm<00:02:09.539> freaked<00:02:10.539> out<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
so as soon as I place I'm freaked out so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.180 
so as soon as I place I'm freaked out so
I<00:02:16.170> don't<00:02:17.170> think<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> turn<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.160> on

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
I don't think you have to turn it on

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.930 
I don't think you have to turn it on
every<00:02:18.400> time<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.150> place<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.370> say<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:23.940> or

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
every time so you place it say I or

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:41.750 
every time so you place it say I or
whatever<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.990> want<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.380> here

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.670 

so<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.360> dash<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:45.090> song<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:47.260> set<00:02:47.530> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
so then you do dash a song you set it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.580 
so then you do dash a song you set it
and<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.910> would<00:02:49.120> do<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.510> last<00:02:49.720> sign<00:02:50.110> text<00:02:50.440> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and it would do the last sign text that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.090 
and it would do the last sign text that
you<00:02:50.680> place<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.720> play<00:02:56.500> signs<00:02:56.830> all

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
you place so you just play signs all

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.460 
you place so you just play signs all
over<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.970> can<00:02:58.120> even<00:02:58.209> break<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.600> original<00:02:59.319> one

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
over you can even break the original one

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:06.660 
over you can even break the original one
and<00:03:02.970> place<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.270> again<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.220> every<00:03:06.220> sign<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
and place it again and every sign of you

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.170 
and place it again and every sign of you
place<00:03:06.880> after<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:08.800> like<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.250> if<00:03:09.459> you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
place after that is on like that if you

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.470

want<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.750> set<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> sign<00:03:11.380> text<00:03:11.680> again<00:03:11.920> do<00:03:12.580> dash

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
want to set the sign text again do dash

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.860 
want to set the sign text again do dash
a<00:03:13.780> sign<00:03:14.610> tog<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:16.030> then<00:03:16.870> sup<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.860> sign<00:03:18.220> techs

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
a sign tog and then sup the sign techs

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810 
a sign tog and then sup the sign techs
who<00:03:19.870> breach<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.230> process<00:03:20.680> if<00:03:20.920> you<00:03:21.519> want<00:03:21.700> to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
who breach the process if you want to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.300 
who breach the process if you want to
stop<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:23.350> do<00:03:23.530> dash<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.070> sign<00:03:24.820> off<00:03:27.870> so

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
stop it just do dash is sign off so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.500 
stop it just do dash is sign off so
that's<00:03:30.310> about<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:31.200> see<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.260> next<00:03:32.350> video
