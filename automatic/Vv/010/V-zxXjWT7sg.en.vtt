my<00:03:40.010> am<00:03:40.220> very<00:03:40.670> jacket<00:03:41.209> now<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.810> one's<00:03:42.049> from

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.020 
my am very jacket now this one's from
H&amp;M<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:45.079> for<00:03:45.230> quite<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.410> while

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
H&amp;M it for quite a while

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.300 
H&amp;M it for quite a while
see<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.450> just<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.320> warm<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.980> I

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
see it's just because it's so warm and I

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.860 
see it's just because it's so warm and I
could<00:03:49.790> probably<00:03:50.000> wear<00:03:50.209> nothing<00:03:50.690> underneath

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
could probably wear nothing underneath

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.780 
could probably wear nothing underneath
it<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.440> still<00:03:51.709> be<00:03:51.860> warm<00:03:52.070> enough<00:03:52.370> that's<00:03:52.640> just

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
it and still be warm enough that's just

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.340 
it and still be warm enough that's just
what<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.090> looks<00:03:53.390> like<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:53.930> dark

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350
