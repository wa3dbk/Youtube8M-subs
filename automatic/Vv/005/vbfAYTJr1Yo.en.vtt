00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.309
 good guys welcome to a video on 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.600
 which I will explain everything or 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.469
 less everything I know about the 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.910
 fifa regenerations 14 career mode 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.470
 what are the good feedbacks we are going to 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.470
 start there for the important thing the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.600
 regenerations is the way that the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.880
 game to keep the market from 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.070
 players full of players or the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.260
 market or the world does not fill the body 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.829
 so to speak that is to say at the moment 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.880
 how good at the moment when 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.350
 example to me an old player I will go to 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.940
 for whom I have an old man is teaching 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.040
 with the race mode of the beasts of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.399
 honey at the moment when for example 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.570
 Yaya Tour who is 35 years old decides 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.600
 retire if I have 40 players in the 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.290
 template I would stay with 39 if that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.899
 happens on all the game's computers to 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.510
 As the years go past 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.070
 templates will go say decaying so 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.409
 So much time will come when I will not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.119
 there are players that is the progression 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.620
 Many years will pass of course 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.380
 but the progression 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.390
 there are many players that have less 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.030
 I play the way to correct what has 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.770
 is creating a player 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.180
 and invented I have not invented there 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.520
 many players invented as 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.810
 you know they are very long names and in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.850
 when he retires for example 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.729
 Yaya touré then I will leave a player 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 similar to yaya touré to that we refer 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.300
 with the feedbacks when I was 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 go yaya touré on the team 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.070
 there are times that do not usually happen they tend to be 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 failures of the game but usually if I 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.170
 a new and young player will come out and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 I'll be able to have it on the computer what 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 same goes for all the players by 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.180
 example we know that drogba to this day 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.520
 he's a very old player, not if 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.960
 We will see that we are not going to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 find equal if the same has not been 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.659
 retired yet I believe that no 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.110
 It's not really drug I remember 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.960
 I'm in the year 2010 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.800
 2000 2019 of course this season 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.380
 2018 2019 and many old players are 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 they have retired that is to say today good today 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.489
 sorry this season in the league 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.440
 he has retired dagger for example or pinto 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.209
 it seems that he is going to withdraw also puyol 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 it's going good he might not be retired but 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.370
 almost at the international level has 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.590
 retired geek retires or is he gone 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.120
 Forever is net and rivalry 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.459
 also that I think it was not in the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 game but they're still young they 're going to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.940
 they will be removed and as they pass 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.819
 good years, players will fall 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.440
 as squares for example ronaldinho 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.250
 drogba that you have already seen that he is not 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.630
 that is to say ibrahimovic which neither 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.239
 I'm not going to look for it because it was a 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.040
 little long but I know it is not what it is 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.269
 that we have to do good because it is very 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.380
 simple let's see for example the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.450
 rest of the world 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.070
 galatasaray to see if it comes out here is worth 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.130
 galatasaray we want to look for the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.490
 Drogba regeneration as we have 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.860
 to go to the team where he retired drugs 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.610
 and we have to find a forward that 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.380
 be young and the truth that you see the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.750
 less than first it's good because it 's 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.420
 drug in its most glorious stage was very 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.100
 Well, you have to search for that, not here 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.310
 note that there is a forward with 21 years 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.650
 that long ago retired drug 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.319
 here on the other front with 22 other 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:34.510
 with 18 other with 21 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:38.810
 ok let's see this of 21 ok we see 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.430
 we see that dry juniors sangaré is a 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.579
 forward and is 21 years old 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.790
 they usually enter when they are 19 18 years old 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.170
 17 even so it's like three or 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.849
 four seasons that I retired 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.269
 Drogba is looking at the rest of 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:57.230
 players kevin freak is a Swedish of 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.359
 about 70 and I do not do not put anything right in 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.129
 that under the ambulance you see that 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.700
 it comes out as a signal that puts leads into the 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.400
 club since 2018 nothing comes out in george 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.079
 hat on 'equal 22 years about 73 Scottish 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.139
 he does not tell me what he's wearing from the club 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.329
 of such alejandro the hoist and the same the 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.310
 is an Argentine contract ends 185 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.410
 it could be well it could be the 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.500
 drug regeneration but of course here 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.330
 we have a forward that is marked more in 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.060
 what was didier drogba is not a 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.820
 front of Ivory Coast is a 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.590
 front that measures 190 and it's also a 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.150
 forward that tells us that it shows 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.750
 have a great potential this is 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.610
 it means 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.220
 either in a regeneration or in a 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.930
 normal player means that 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.790
 the player will reach an average 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.130
 considerable that it's going to be pretty good 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.250
 as the years go by right now 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.750
 I can not assign anyone because the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.610
 I have busy but you if it leaves you 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.180
 send a scout you will see that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.070
 surely a player is the truth that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.320
 it will be pretty good it will not be a 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.720
 wonder not with 21 years but that 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.790
 surely when I get to 25 26 then 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.680
 it will be like drone joana these are the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.590
 regenerations nothing else there is nothing else 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.400
 behind that then just then 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.710
 in your career mode they will leave 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.330
 withdrawing certain players and they will go 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.860
 appearing on those computers for example 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.300
 in real madrid when in the 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.520
 Realmadrid forgiveness when you retire 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.330
 Christian will come out a player with a 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.230
 very long name surely you have 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.630
 Well, it's pretty good 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.460
 will be the regeneration of Christian in the 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.710
 bayern of Munich if ribery does not leave 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.470
 before he retires in the bayern of Munich 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.540
 and someone will come out who is very good at 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.720
 athletic mineiro will pass the same with 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.370
 Christian pardon with ronaldinho i fiché 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.510
 to the regeneration of ronaldinho and the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.030
 I sent the real Madrid because I 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.910
 they bought and I can tell you that the 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.040
 regeneration is this carballo matheus 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.230
 to Lima with 22 years 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.000
 I know this is because there was no other in 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.580
 the athletic mineiro and it has to be this 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.819
 the one that replaced ronaldinho 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.819
 and well, nothing more simply good 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.500
 luka modric is going to retire soon 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.960
 there will be many here also iker 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.650
 casillas cristiano ronaldo is 34 years old 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.479
 squares has 37 fixes that you do not 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.249
 it can be good to play for the story says 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.319
 the value zero euro 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.389
 surely the realmadrid will be removed and 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.759
 when he retires they will leave a goalkeeper 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:32.029
 that is similar to iker boxes and that 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.469
 when it gets better, copy a little 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.899
 attributes of iker boxes will not be 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.879
 perfect everything is worth ibrahimovic is not going to 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:40.159
 give a feedback that is perfect 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.359
 that is a according to debrá of mobile but yes 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.009
 that are players that look like 

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:44.809
 not quite and they are players that although 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.759
 they do not even look like one because 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.949
 happen that sometimes gives a feedback 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.889
 which is completely the opposite yes that 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.109
 we know that they are players that of messi 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.969
 stitched a player a regeneration a 

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:57.919
 defense by chance because yes that 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.950
 we know that defense will reach 90 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.660
 92 quietly medium 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.730
 and nothing else that is the regenerations 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.710
 as I say also another tactic for 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.990
 have them then it's like I did with yaya 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.910
 I toured and put them in the team 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.790
 sign them and they retire in the team 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.420
 we already know that it will come out yes or yes in that 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.190
 team and good well with time already 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.840
 you know that you can access the rest os 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.180
 I recommend giving in to the players that 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.640
 you have to be young promises in a 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.710
 game do not dispute many minutes not 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.000
 have a lot of minutes and nothing more 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.560
 I just hope you liked it 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.810
 the video I hope you have served 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.220
 help if you have any further questions about the 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.470
 regeneration is something that has me 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.150
 I forgot to say you can tell me 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.910
 in the comments that I will answer 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.830
 gladly to your questions and nothing 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.480
 more see you in the next one we follow 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:46.580
 with the streamings of the beasts of 

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.940
 daimiel set from match against 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.320
 chelsea important and what I said I hope that 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.460
 I have helped you and see you in 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.460
