00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
hard for me to find things that look

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.610

right on me but I really like these
they're<00:03:11.400> different<00:03:11.730> than<00:03:12.090> any<00:03:12.360> other<00:03:12.450> glasses

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
they're different than any other glasses

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.670 
they're different than any other glasses
that<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.410> own<00:03:13.680> I'm<00:03:14.340> kind<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.700> scared<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.209> glasses

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
that I own I'm kind of scared of glasses

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.660 
that I own I'm kind of scared of glasses
altogether<00:03:16.680> but<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.340> really<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.760> like<00:03:17.940> these

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
altogether but I really do like these

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.280 
altogether but I really do like these
and<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.299> thought<00:03:21.510> they<00:03:21.690> were<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:21.959> cute

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and I just thought they were really cute

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.110 
and I just thought they were really cute
so<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> next<00:03:23.040> pair<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.220> glasses<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.700> got<00:03:23.910> are

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
so the next pair of glasses I got are

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.210 
so the next pair of glasses I got are
definitely<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.750> most<00:03:24.900> unique<00:03:25.080> out<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:25.890> all<00:03:26.040> of

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
definitely the most unique out of all of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.360 
definitely the most unique out of all of
them<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.670> they<00:03:27.090> look<00:03:27.330> like<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:28.010> again<00:03:29.010> they

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
them and they look like this again they

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.050 
them and they look like this again they
had<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:29.700> reflective<00:03:30.239> mirror<00:03:30.600> look<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.190> I

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
had that reflective mirror look and I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.650 
had that reflective mirror look and I
thought<00:03:33.269> these<00:03:33.510> were<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.340> cool<00:03:35.340> I've<00:03:36.329> never

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
thought these were so cool I've never

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.360 
thought these were so cool I've never
seen<00:03:36.959> any<00:03:37.200> glasses<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.799> looked<00:03:38.010> like<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.340> I

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
seen any glasses that looked like this I

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.620 
seen any glasses that looked like this I
really<00:03:38.910> like<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.299> detailing<00:03:41.150> here<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.510> I'm

really like the detailing here and I'm
here<00:03:43.850> now<00:03:44.850> these<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.360> definitely<00:03:46.110> not<00:03:46.470> for

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
here now these are definitely not for

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.250 
here now these are definitely not for
everyone

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
everyone

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.990 
everyone
they<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.320> look<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.860> little<00:03:50.010> funky<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.610> me<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:50.970> I

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
they do look a little funky on me but I

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.449 
they do look a little funky on me but I
like<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.620> definitely<00:03:52.799> have<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
like that you definitely have to have a

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.400 
like that you definitely have to have a
certain<00:03:53.760> swag<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.600> be<00:03:54.690> able<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.870> pull<00:03:55.079> them<00:03:55.200> off

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
certain swag to be able to pull them off

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.500 
certain swag to be able to pull them off
but<00:03:56.100> they<00:03:56.250> look<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.910> when<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.269> try

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
but they look like this when you try

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.910 
but they look like this when you try
them<00:03:57.630> on

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.530 

and<00:04:02.920> I<00:04:03.190> thought<00:04:03.400> these<00:04:03.640> are<00:04:03.880> very<00:04:04.210> unique

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and I thought these are very unique

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.170 
and I thought these are very unique
again<00:04:05.170> I've<00:04:05.380> never<00:04:05.680> seen<00:04:06.520> anything<00:04:06.880> like<00:04:07.120> this

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
again I've never seen anything like this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.160 
again I've never seen anything like this
so<00:04:10.180> if<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.480> want<00:04:10.690> something<00:04:11.050> that's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
so if you want something that's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.290 
so if you want something that's
definitely<00:04:11.500> different<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.700> nobody<00:04:13.090> else

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300
