00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250 
Harbison's that encompasses a variety of
terrain<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:38.000> on<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.329> bluff<00:02:38.569> above<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

terrain it's on the bluff above the
Broad<00:02:39.500> River<00:02:39.769> so<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.519> several<00:02:41.180> hundred

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
Broad River so you have several hundred

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.660 
Broad River so you have several hundred
feet<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.720> elevation<00:02:41.870> change<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.310> got<00:02:43.489> some

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
feet of elevation change so you got some

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.059 
feet of elevation change so you got some
pretty<00:02:43.819> fast<00:02:44.090> down<00:02:44.329> hills<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.709> they've<00:02:45.889> got

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
pretty fast down hills so they've got

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.550 
pretty fast down hills so they've got
really<00:02:46.280> good<00:02:46.489> flow<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:48.049> know<00:02:48.170> there's<00:02:48.410> some

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
really good flow you know there's some

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.410 
really good flow you know there's some
real<00:02:48.709> technical<00:02:48.950> sections<00:02:49.730> with<00:02:50.120> rock

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
real technical sections with rock

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.800 
real technical sections with rock
gardens<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.519> steep<00:02:52.519> climbs<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.540> quick

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
gardens and steep climbs and quick

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
gardens and steep climbs and quick
descents<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.370> really<00:02:55.700> pretty

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
descents and it's really pretty

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.640 
descents and it's really pretty
challenging<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.480> lot<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.720> people<00:02:56.989> who<00:02:57.079> come<00:02:57.290> to

you've<00:03:56.810> got<00:03:57.019> some<00:03:57.200> switchbacks<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.480> know

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
you've got some switchbacks and you know

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.390 
you've got some switchbacks and you know
a<00:03:59.630> few<00:03:59.720> surprises<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:00.650> drop-offs<00:04:01.160> and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
a few surprises with drop-offs and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.150 
a few surprises with drop-offs and
things<00:04:01.610> like<00:04:01.790> that<00:04:01.850> some<00:04:02.239> big<00:04:02.420> whoops<00:04:03.160> that's

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
things like that some big whoops that's

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.740 
things like that some big whoops that's
where<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.489> rock<00:04:04.640> garden<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:05.540> real

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
where the rock garden is and it's real

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.180 
where the rock garden is and it's real
pretty<00:04:05.900> you<00:04:06.200> know<00:04:06.260> it's<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.530> ever<00:04:06.680> look<00:04:06.860> in<00:04:07.010> the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
pretty you know it's I ever look in the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.860 
pretty you know it's I ever look in the
Broad<00:04:07.430> River<00:04:07.670> which<00:04:07.970> is<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.120> beautiful<00:04:08.510> river

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
Broad River which is a beautiful river

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.890 
Broad River which is a beautiful river
and<00:04:09.760> yeah<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:10.790> think<00:04:10.940> that's<00:04:11.360> probably<00:04:11.630> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
and yeah I think that's probably the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
and yeah I think that's probably the
highlight<00:04:12.140> of<00:04:12.350> Harvison

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.980 

you
