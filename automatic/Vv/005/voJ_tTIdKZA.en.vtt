00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.980 
something to mold it in some vaseline
spray<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.910> concrete<00:00:24.300> does<00:00:24.420> stick<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
spray so the concrete does stick to the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.370

something to mix it with the first thing
you're<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> want<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.820> pour<00:00:39.270> up

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you're going to want to do is pour up

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
you're going to want to do is pour up
some<00:00:39.570> concrete<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.320> container<00:00:40.770> or<00:00:41.100> whatever

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
some concrete in a container or whatever

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.060 
some concrete in a container or whatever
that<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> mix<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.890> what

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that you want to mix it in and then what

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
that you want to mix it in and then what
you<00:00:44.190> could<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.969> usually<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you could do which I usually do is you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
you could do which I usually do is you
take<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.680> these<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.660> pour<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> concrete

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
take one of these and pour the concrete

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.680 
take one of these and pour the concrete
through<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.730> eliminates<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.449> bigger

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
through it so it eliminates the bigger

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
through it so it eliminates the bigger
rocks<00:00:52.010> which<00:00:53.010> gives<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.789> smoother

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
rocks which gives you a much smoother

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.049 
rocks which gives you a much smoother
and<00:00:54.660> nicer<00:00:54.809> concrete<00:00:55.559> curb<00:00:55.770> okay<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.699> start

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and nicer concrete curb okay so start

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
and nicer concrete curb okay so start
off<00:00:57.180> by<00:00:57.420> pouring<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:57.870> concrete<00:00:58.440> into<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
off by pouring some concrete into the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
off by pouring some concrete into the
container<00:00:59.699> you're<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> mix<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
container you're going to mix it in and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.340 
container you're going to mix it in and
then<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> start<00:01:02.039> adding<00:01:02.219> water<00:01:02.520> but

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
then you can start adding water but

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.750 
then you can start adding water but
start<00:01:04.350> off<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.769> adding<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.610> water

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
start off by just adding a little water

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.539 
start off by just adding a little water
so<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> don't<00:01:06.930> add<00:01:07.080> too<00:01:07.290> much<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.460> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so you don't add too much and then you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
so you don't add too much and then you
can<00:01:08.760> add<00:01:08.939> more<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.170> along

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
can add more and more as you go along

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.660 
can add more and more as you go along
mixing<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.560 

and<00:01:17.620> then<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.740> start<00:01:19.010> retweets<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.210> you'll

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
and then you start retweets and you'll

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.530 
and then you start retweets and you'll
see<00:01:24.310> your<00:01:25.310> policy<00:01:25.790> that<00:01:25.820> you'll<00:01:26.090> need<00:01:26.270> more

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
see your policy that you'll need more

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:36.590 
see your policy that you'll need more
water

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 

so<00:01:37.440> you're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> want<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> keep<00:01:38.130> doing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so you're going to want to keep doing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.120 
so you're going to want to keep doing
this<00:01:38.580> until<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.930> concrete<00:01:40.409> crashes<00:01:40.860> like

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this until the concrete crashes like

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.719 
this until the concrete crashes like
mashed<00:01:41.400> potatoes<00:01:42.860> kind<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
mashed potatoes kind of like that and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.390 
mashed potatoes kind of like that and
that's<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.140> time<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> start<00:01:46.979> pouring

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
that's when it's time to start pouring

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.270 
that's when it's time to start pouring
it<00:01:47.520> into<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.760> mold<00:01:48.350> for<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.440> mold<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:49.950> pick

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
it into the mold for a mold you can pick

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.040 
it into the mold for a mold you can pick
almost<00:01:50.520> anything<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.150> has<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> nice<00:01:51.750> shape

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
almost anything that has a nice shape

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.680 
almost anything that has a nice shape
and<00:01:52.260> would<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.220> good<00:01:53.580> fingerboard<00:01:54.150> obstacle

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
and would be a good fingerboard obstacle

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.840 
and would be a good fingerboard obstacle
it<00:01:54.900> could<00:01:55.050> be<00:01:55.229> plastic<00:01:55.830> metal<00:01:56.160> or<00:01:56.430> something

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it could be plastic metal or something

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.880 
it could be plastic metal or something
like<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.900> something<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.680> concrete

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
like that is something that the concrete

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.570 
like that is something that the concrete
wouldn't<00:01:59.430> easily<00:01:59.550> stick<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.410> chose<00:02:02.280> this

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
wouldn't easily stick to so I chose this

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.140 
wouldn't easily stick to so I chose this
plastic<00:02:03.509> container<00:02:04.310> so<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.580> next<00:02:05.820> thing

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
plastic container so the next thing

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.999 
plastic container so the next thing
you're<00:02:06.660> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.500> spray<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you're going to want to do is spray it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.300 
you're going to want to do is spray it
with<00:02:08.399> vaseline<00:02:09.149> or<00:02:09.709> something<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.860> makes<00:02:11.100> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
with vaseline or something that makes it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.350 
with vaseline or something that makes it
non<00:02:11.580> sticky<00:02:15.140> like<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:17.030> then<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.150> can

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
non sticky like so and then you can

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:31.640 
non sticky like so and then you can
start<00:02:18.600> adding<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.410> concrete<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:31.500> you're

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
start adding the concrete when you're

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.440 
start adding the concrete when you're
done<00:02:31.769> filling<00:02:32.070> your<00:02:32.250> mom<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.610> concrete<00:02:33.030> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
done filling your mom with concrete you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.140 
done filling your mom with concrete you
can<00:02:33.480> start<00:02:33.900> doing<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.910> basically<00:02:35.910> what

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
can start doing this and basically what

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.110 
can start doing this and basically what
it<00:02:36.239> does<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.200> makes<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> bubbles<00:02:38.280> air

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it does is that it makes the bubbles air

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.750 
it does is that it makes the bubbles air
bubbles<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> surface<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.620> pop<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
bubbles go up to the surface and pop so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.310 
bubbles go up to the surface and pop so
they<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.090> stay<00:02:42.299> at<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> bottom<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.080> then

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
they don't stay at the bottom and then

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.530 
they don't stay at the bottom and then
later<00:02:43.560> on<00:02:43.739> when<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:45.090> you're<00:02:45.209> done<00:02:45.330> with

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
later on when you when you're done with

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
later on when you when you're done with
the<00:02:45.660> curb<00:02:45.900> there's<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.920> air<00:02:47.190> bubbles

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
the curb there's going to be air bubbles

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.610 
the curb there's going to be air bubbles
all<00:02:47.820> over<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.019> surface<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.530> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
all over it and the surface is going to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.100 
all over it and the surface is going to
be<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:50.100> rough<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.549> not<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.480> smooth<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
be really rough and not as smooth as you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.090 
be really rough and not as smooth as you
want<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.620> when<00:02:52.799> you're<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
want it to be when you're going to

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.210 
want it to be when you're going to
fingerboard<00:02:53.489> on<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:55.920> do

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
fingerboard on it so you can just do

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.729 
fingerboard on it so you can just do
this<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.670> while<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.060> you're<00:02:57.269> going<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> see

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
this for a while and you're going to see

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.319 
this for a while and you're going to see
small<00:02:58.739> bubbles<00:02:58.920> come<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> surface<00:02:59.940> and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
small bubbles come up to the surface and

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.539 
small bubbles come up to the surface and
when<00:03:01.290> you're<00:03:01.440> done<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.799> let<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> move

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
when you're done with that let the move

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.310 
when you're done with that let the move
sit<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.060> about<00:03:03.239> three<00:03:03.480> days<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
sit for about three days and then you

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.069 
sit for about three days and then you
can<00:03:04.470> take<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:05.239> feel<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.450> surface<00:03:06.660> with

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
can take it out feel the surface with

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.470 
can take it out feel the surface with
your<00:03:07.230> hand<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:08.400> still<00:03:08.640> cold<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.269> means

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
your hand if it's still cold it means

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.110 
your hand if it's still cold it means
it's<00:03:09.750> not<00:03:09.870> completely<00:03:10.500> dry<00:03:10.769> inside<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.940> it's

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it's not completely dry inside but it's

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.759 
it's not completely dry inside but it's
still<00:03:12.299> okay<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.900> finger<00:03:13.260> board<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.530> or

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
still okay to like finger board on or

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.650 
still okay to like finger board on or
whatever<00:03:13.980> buds<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:14.970> it's<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.329> room

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
whatever buds when it's the room

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.410 
whatever buds when it's the room
temperature<00:03:16.230> then<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.400> completely<00:03:17.940> drying

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
temperature then it's completely drying

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.650 
temperature then it's completely drying
and<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.890> have<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.070> finger<00:03:20.489> board<00:03:20.730> metal<00:03:21.060> pad<00:03:21.390> or

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
and you have a finger board metal pad or

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.500 
and you have a finger board metal pad or
curved<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:23.549> that's<00:03:23.730> about<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.180> my

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
curved so that's about it for my

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.170 
curved so that's about it for my
tutorial<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.320> how<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.920> make<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> concrete<00:03:26.970> metal

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
tutorial on how to make a concrete metal

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.080 
tutorial on how to make a concrete metal
pad<00:03:27.540> or<00:03:27.690> curb<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.489> also<00:03:29.489> when<00:03:29.640> you're<00:03:29.730> taking

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
pad or curb and also when you're taking

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.030 
pad or curb and also when you're taking
it<00:03:30.180> out<00:03:30.269> remote<00:03:30.630> there's<00:03:31.019> no<00:03:31.200> need<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> sand<00:03:31.860> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
it out remote there's no need to sand it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.090 
it out remote there's no need to sand it
or<00:03:32.280> something<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.000> because<00:03:33.769> yeah<00:03:34.769> it's

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
or something like that because yeah it's

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.280 
or something like that because yeah it's
going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.489> really<00:03:35.790> smooth<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.299> you've<00:03:37.079> got

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
going to be really smooth if you've got

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.530 
going to be really smooth if you've got
it<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:37.650> way

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
it the right way

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.660 
it the right way
so<00:03:39.140> go<00:03:39.530> make<00:03:39.739> one<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.510> shrimp<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.890> also<00:03:46.459> if

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
so go make one and shrimp and also if

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.879 
so go make one and shrimp and also if
you
