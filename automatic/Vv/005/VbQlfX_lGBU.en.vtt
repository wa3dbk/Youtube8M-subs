00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.560
 to sauté 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.280
 here we suffer it until it is all 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.430
 poached we add salt and pepper together 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.200

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.090
 freshness that peppermint will give you 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.310
 a little scent to give the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.860
 cockles above they get confused 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.020
