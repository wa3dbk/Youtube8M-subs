00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.480 
probably not because I just a lot of
money<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.720> need<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.960> save<00:04:53.170> and<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:54.010> have<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.160> few<00:04:54.430> of

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
money I need to save and I have a few of

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.710 
money I need to save and I have a few of
the<00:04:54.580> things<00:04:54.640> i<00:04:54.820> want<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.000> buy<00:04:55.150> two<00:04:55.210> that's<00:04:55.600> a

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
the things i want to buy two that's a

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.540 
the things i want to buy two that's a
little<00:04:56.380> more<00:04:56.500> important<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.860> me<00:04:56.920> than<00:04:57.010> lego<00:04:57.430> at

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
little more important to me than lego at

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.630 
little more important to me than lego at
least<00:04:57.730> at<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.120> moment<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:59.800> that's<00:05:00.400> that's

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
least at the moment so that's that's

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.790 
least at the moment so that's that's
another<00:05:00.880> reason<00:05:01.060> for<00:05:01.210> lack<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.540> videos<00:05:02.440> is

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
another reason for lack of videos is

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.640 
another reason for lack of videos is
lack<00:05:02.980> of<00:05:03.010> but<00:05:03.430> i<00:05:03.670> have<00:05:04.570> no<00:05:04.900> lego<00:05:05.140> budget<00:05:05.470> right

time<00:07:02.629> the<00:07:02.750> videos<00:07:02.990> are<00:07:03.020> going<00:07:03.169> to<00:07:03.229> pick<00:07:03.349> up<00:07:03.439> the

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:03.529 
time the videos are going to pick up the

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:05.260 
time the videos are going to pick up the
pace<00:07:03.710> tremendously<00:07:04.669> that's<00:07:04.879> when<00:07:05.000> the<00:07:05.060> secret

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
pace tremendously that's when the secret

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.610 
pace tremendously that's when the secret
projects<00:07:05.539> going<00:07:05.629> to<00:07:05.689> come<00:07:05.839> out<00:07:05.990> in<00:07:06.139> the<00:07:06.379> summer

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620

projects going to come out in the summer
so<00:07:07.479> that's<00:07:08.479> when<00:07:08.839> the<00:07:09.050> videos<00:07:09.409> will

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
so that's when the videos will

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.610 
so that's when the videos will
definitely<00:07:10.759> become<00:07:11.210> more<00:07:11.839> frequent<00:07:12.110> but<00:07:12.439> for

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
definitely become more frequent but for

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.350 
definitely become more frequent but for
now<00:07:12.770> they're<00:07:13.370> going<00:07:13.520> to<00:07:13.639> start<00:07:13.789> to<00:07:13.969> slow<00:07:14.210> down

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
now they're going to start to slow down

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.519 
now they're going to start to slow down
slightly<00:07:14.599> doesn't<00:07:14.990> that<00:07:15.110> doesn't<00:07:15.199> mean<00:07:15.439> to

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:15.529 
slightly doesn't that doesn't mean to

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:16.749 
slightly doesn't that doesn't mean to
unsubscribe<00:07:15.830> because<00:07:16.370> there's<00:07:16.550> a<00:07:16.610> lot<00:07:16.729> of

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
unsubscribe because there's a lot of

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.459
