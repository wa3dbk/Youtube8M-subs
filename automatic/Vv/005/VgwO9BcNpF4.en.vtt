00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.750 

all<00:00:01.410> right<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:01.920> with<00:00:02.070> a<00:00:02.100> workaround<00:00:02.490> for

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right I'm here with a workaround for

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.230 
all right I'm here with a workaround for
those<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.360> who<00:00:03.689> like<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:05.240> talkback

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
those of you who like the talkback

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
those of you who like the talkback
plug-in<00:00:06.750> but<00:00:07.680> don't<00:00:08.639> want<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.330> wait<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
plug-in but don't want to wait for the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.129 
plug-in but don't want to wait for the
AAA<00:00:10.700> x64<00:00:11.700> version<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.540> released<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.019> you

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
AAA x64 version to be released so you

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070 
AAA x64 version to be released so you
can<00:00:13.290> use<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.710> Pro<00:00:13.889> Tools<00:00:14.160> 11<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> I've

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
can use it with Pro Tools 11 so I've

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380 
can use it with Pro Tools 11 so I've
developed<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.800> way<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.029> basically<00:00:18.029> get<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
developed a way to basically get the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.689 
developed a way to basically get the
same<00:00:18.570> functionality<00:00:19.170> using<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.310> bundled

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
same functionality using the bundled

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.759 
same functionality using the bundled
channel<00:00:21.119> strip<00:00:21.330> plug-in<00:00:21.720> we'll<00:00:22.439> need<00:00:22.560> two

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
channel strip plug-in we'll need two

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.609 
channel strip plug-in we'll need two
instances<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> bit<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> routing<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.960> I'll

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
instances and a bit of routing and I'll

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.130 
instances and a bit of routing and I'll
show<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.830> how<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:27.960> thing

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
show you how to do that the first thing

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.730 
show you how to do that the first thing
we<00:00:28.260> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.920> render<00:00:29.340> some<00:00:29.960> tone<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
we want to do is render some tone this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.490 
we want to do is render some tone this
is<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.460> kilohertz<00:00:32.850> tone<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.540> negative<00:00:34.200> 20

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is one kilohertz tone at negative 20

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.459 
is one kilohertz tone at negative 20
decibels<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.930> rendered<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
decibels and I just rendered it on a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.119 
decibels and I just rendered it on a
track<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.360> here<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.270> actually

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
track and here you can see I actually

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.420 
track and here you can see I actually
looped<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:48.300> original<00:00:48.950> if<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.190> just

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
looped it out so the original if we just

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.810 
looped it out so the original if we just
make<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> selection<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.360> then<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:53.190> Windows<00:00:53.550> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
make a selection and then on Windows we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
make a selection and then on Windows we
can<00:00:54.030> go<00:00:54.239> shift<00:00:54.899> windows<00:00:55.559> alt<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.309> 3<00:00:57.739> oops

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
can go shift windows alt and 3 oops

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.880 
can go shift windows alt and 3 oops
that's<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> wrong<00:00:59.699> three<00:01:00.180> shift<00:01:01.170> windows<00:01:01.590> alt

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that's the wrong three shift windows alt

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.660 
that's the wrong three shift windows alt
and<00:01:02.129> three<00:01:02.879> above<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.080> ASCII<00:01:05.010> keyboard<00:01:05.189> not

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and three above your ASCII keyboard not

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
and three above your ASCII keyboard not
on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> numpad<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:06.960> render<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> tone

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
on the numpad that will render the tone

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
on the numpad that will render the tone
and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> course<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.830> loop<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> out

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and then of course you can loop it out

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120 
and then of course you can loop it out
the<00:01:12.540> idea<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.110> loop<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the idea is you loop it out for the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.270 
the idea is you loop it out for the
entire<00:01:14.670> length<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.390> your<00:01:15.450> session<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.280> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
entire length of your session here so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
entire length of your session here so
this<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.670> act<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> key<00:01:18.330> input<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.530> I'll

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
this will act as a key input and I'll

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
this will act as a key input and I'll
show<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> works<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:22.140> tone

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
show you how this works so this tone

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
show you how this works so this tone
here<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.119> going<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.450> bus<00:01:24.990> 1<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.820> our<00:01:26.820> first

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
here is going out bus 1 and our first

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
here is going out bus 1 and our first
instance<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> channel<00:01:28.080> strip<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:28.560> I've

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
instance of channel strip here I've

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
instance of channel strip here I've
hidden<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.549> disabled<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.329> parts<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
hidden and disabled the other parts of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
hidden and disabled the other parts of
it<00:01:31.200> except<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.560> dynamics<00:01:33.740> first<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.909> key

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
it except for dynamics first off the key

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
it except for dynamics first off the key
input<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:37.220> matches<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.960> go

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
input here matches that and then we go

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
input here matches that and then we go
into<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.740> sidechain<00:01:40.979> tab<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.720> our

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
into the sidechain tab here and our

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.440 
into the sidechain tab here and our
source<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.829> key<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> now<00:01:45.299> this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
source is going to be key so now this

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.249 
source is going to be key so now this
compressor<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:48.259> generated

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
compressor is going to use the generated

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.310 
compressor is going to use the generated
tone<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:51.390> trigger<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> gain<00:01:52.049> reduction

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
tone to trigger the gain reduction

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
tone to trigger the gain reduction
circuit<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.490> all<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.420> over

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
circuit so all we have to do is go over

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
circuit so all we have to do is go over
to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.049> compressor<00:01:55.619> limiter<00:01:55.770> tab<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.430> set

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
to the compressor limiter tab here set

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.120 
to the compressor limiter tab here set
the<00:01:57.149> threshold<00:01:57.600> below<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.409> level<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> which

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the threshold below the level of which

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.760 
the threshold below the level of which
the<00:01:59.549> tone<00:01:59.759> will<00:01:59.969> come<00:02:00.149> through<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.680> we

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the tone will come through so here we

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.690 
the tone will come through so here we
have<00:02:01.890> negative<00:02:02.840> 36.8<00:02:04.159> which<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> below

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
have negative 36.8 which is below

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.510 
have negative 36.8 which is below
negative<00:02:06.149> 20<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:07.979> means<00:02:08.280> while<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
negative 20 so that means while the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.660 
negative 20 so that means while the
transport<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.179> running<00:02:09.560> as<00:02:10.560> long<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.459> have

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
transport is running as long as you have

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
transport is running as long as you have
extended<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
extended this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.550 
extended this
throughout<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.400> entire<00:02:14.520> session<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:16.200> going

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
throughout the entire session it's going

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.650 
throughout the entire session it's going
to<00:02:16.740> duck<00:02:17.070> your<00:02:17.870> talkback<00:02:18.870> signal<00:02:20.270> by<00:02:21.270> more

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
to duck your talkback signal by more

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.450 
to duck your talkback signal by more
than<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.840> hundred<00:02:21.990> decibels<00:02:22.320> now<00:02:22.890> this<00:02:23.160> isn't

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
than a hundred decibels now this isn't

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.680 
than a hundred decibels now this isn't
perfect<00:02:23.850> I've<00:02:24.000> run<00:02:24.150> into<00:02:24.300> some<00:02:24.540> funky

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
perfect I've run into some funky

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.130 
perfect I've run into some funky
behavior<00:02:25.230> here<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:26.700> know<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.030> happens<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
behavior here but you know it happens so

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
behavior here but you know it happens so
I'll<00:02:28.230> demonstrate<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.710> for<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.220> here

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
I'll demonstrate that for you here

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.180 
I'll demonstrate that for you here
you're<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> witness<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.200> input<00:02:31.860> level

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
you're going to witness the input level

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.430 
you're going to witness the input level
of<00:02:32.340> my<00:02:32.610> microphone<00:02:33.120> which<00:02:33.660> will<00:02:33.960> be<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
of my microphone which will be the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.250 
of my microphone which will be the
talkback<00:02:34.800> mic<00:02:35.480> that's<00:02:36.480> coming<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:36.960> on<00:02:37.080> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
talkback mic that's coming in on this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.610 
talkback mic that's coming in on this
channel<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:38.070> fed<00:02:38.850> by<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.210> microphone<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
channel here fed by my microphone the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770 
channel here fed by my microphone the
output<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.880> session<00:02:42.330> you're<00:02:42.570> going<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
output in your session you're going to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
output in your session you're going to
want<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.020> go<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> either<00:02:44.450> an<00:02:45.500> unused<00:02:46.500> output

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
want to go to either an unused output

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.540 
want to go to either an unused output
and<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:48.420> use<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> send<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.320> go<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.920> Q<00:02:50.130> sends

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
and then use a send to go to the Q sends

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.640 
and then use a send to go to the Q sends
or<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.270> output<00:02:51.480> directly<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> sins

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
or you can output directly to the sins

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.370 
or you can output directly to the sins
it's<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.750> I'll<00:02:54.870> demonstrate<00:02:54.990> that

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it's up to you so I'll demonstrate that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.580 
it's up to you so I'll demonstrate that
while<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.790> transport<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.420> running<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
while the transport is running and this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.280 
while the transport is running and this
tone<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.250> playing<00:02:59.550> back<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.050> will<00:03:01.170> not

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
tone is playing back that you will not

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.900 
tone is playing back that you will not
hear<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:01.650> microphone<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.370> keep<00:03:02.670> your<00:03:02.760> eye<00:03:02.850> on

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
hear my microphone so keep your eye on

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.120 
hear my microphone so keep your eye on
this<00:03:03.120> level<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.630> notice<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.770> won't<00:03:04.980> hear

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this level and notice you won't hear

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:19.240 
this level and notice you won't hear
anything

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.530 

okay<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.380> see<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.650> red<00:03:21.890> dot

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
okay so you can see this red dot

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.840 
okay so you can see this red dot
represents<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.780> key<00:03:24.410> signal<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.220> that

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
represents the key signal here that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.540 
represents the key signal here that
exceeded<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.720> threshold<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:28.400> will

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
exceeded the threshold and it will

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.700 
exceeded the threshold and it will
always<00:03:28.760> exceed<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.300> threshold<00:03:29.530> given<00:03:30.530> that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
always exceed the threshold given that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.570 
always exceed the threshold given that
it's<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.490> know<00:03:31.520> about<00:03:32.000> 19<00:03:32.390> decibels<00:03:32.840> above<00:03:33.580> so

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
it's you know about 19 decibels above so

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.070 
it's you know about 19 decibels above so
that<00:03:34.610> will<00:03:34.850> handle<00:03:35.210> the<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.860> tape<00:03:37.850> up<00:03:38.420> part<00:03:38.960> of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
that will handle the the tape up part of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.490 
that will handle the the tape up part of
it<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.380> now<00:03:40.280> we're<00:03:40.460> gonna<00:03:40.580> move<00:03:40.820> on<00:03:41.060> to<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
it and now we're gonna move on to the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.500 
it and now we're gonna move on to the
other<00:03:42.800> function<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.860> talkback

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
other function of the of the talkback

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.380 
other function of the of the talkback
which<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.110> plug-in<00:03:48.530> mutes<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.520> if<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.090> exceeds

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
which the plug-in mutes it if it exceeds

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.140 
which the plug-in mutes it if it exceeds
a<00:03:50.570> certain<00:03:50.600> level<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.410> prevent<00:03:52.220> feedback<00:03:52.640> from

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
a certain level to prevent feedback from

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.690 
a certain level to prevent feedback from
ruining<00:03:53.510> everybody's<00:03:54.020> day<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> way<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.580> do

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
ruining everybody's day so the way we do

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.840 
ruining everybody's day so the way we do
it<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:56.630> basically<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.380> mirror<00:03:57.709> image<00:03:57.860> of<00:03:58.250> our

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
it is basically a mirror image of our

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.000 
it is basically a mirror image of our
first<00:04:00.459> excuse<00:04:01.459> me<00:04:01.810> but<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:02.930> time<00:04:02.990> there's<00:04:03.830> no

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
first excuse me but this time there's no

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.810 
first excuse me but this time there's no
key<00:04:04.250> input<00:04:04.640> we<00:04:05.600> are<00:04:05.630> going<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.350> use<00:04:07.280> our<00:04:07.610> mic

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
key input we are going to use our mic

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.580 
key input we are going to use our mic
signal<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.720> trigger<00:04:08.990> the<00:04:09.200> gain<00:04:09.320> reduction

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
signal to trigger the gain reduction

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
signal to trigger the gain reduction
circuit<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.430> our<00:04:10.910> mic<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:12.110> here<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:12.800> just<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.220> set

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
circuit on our mic so here we just I set

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.670 
circuit on our mic so here we just I set
the<00:04:13.730> threshold<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.300> just<00:04:14.720> above<00:04:15.050> where<00:04:15.350> my

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
the threshold to just above where my

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.190 
the threshold to just above where my
voice<00:04:15.830> is<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.430> conversational<00:04:17.180> level<00:04:17.329> and

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
voice is at a conversational level and

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.050 
voice is at a conversational level and
you<00:04:18.470> know<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:19.130> both<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.459> these<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.730> want<00:04:19.850> low

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
you know for both of these you want low

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.120 
you know for both of these you want low
attack<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.690> put<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.079> at<00:04:21.230> one<00:04:21.260> second<00:04:21.890> release

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
attack I put it at one second release

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.570 
attack I put it at one second release
just<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.060> that<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.330> doesn't<00:04:23.660> pop<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:25.040> too<00:04:25.280> quick

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
just so that it doesn't pop in too quick

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.850 
just so that it doesn't pop in too quick
after<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.390> transport<00:04:26.960> stops<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:27.560> after<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
gain reduction once that threshold is

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.340 
gain reduction once that threshold is
increased<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:47.479> can<00:04:47.660> demonstrate<00:04:47.810> that<00:04:48.290> for

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
increased and I can demonstrate that for

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.460 
increased and I can demonstrate that for
you<00:04:48.680> by<00:04:49.520> whistling<00:04:50.270> into<00:04:50.540> my<00:04:50.660> microphone<00:04:51.020> to

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
you by whistling into my microphone to

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.890 
you by whistling into my microphone to
simulate<00:04:51.890> feedback<00:04:52.640> and<00:04:52.940> you'll<00:04:53.360> notice<00:04:53.570> that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
simulate feedback and you'll notice that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.350 
simulate feedback and you'll notice that
a<00:04:54.110> bit<00:04:54.440> of<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.650> signal<00:04:55.040> remains<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.910> I'm<00:04:56.180> not

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
a bit of the signal remains and I'm not

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.780 
a bit of the signal remains and I'm not
quite<00:04:56.540> sure<00:04:56.600> why<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:57.590> anyway<00:04:58.430> here

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
quite sure why that is but anyway here

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.709 
quite sure why that is but anyway here
goes

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.649 

so<00:05:03.800> given<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.949> this<00:05:05.370> level<00:05:05.789> is<00:05:05.939> right<00:05:06.360> above

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
so given that this level is right above

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:09.469 
so given that this level is right above
where<00:05:06.719> my<00:05:07.139> conversational<00:05:07.979> voice<00:05:08.159> is<00:05:08.550> even<00:05:09.240> if

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
where my conversational voice is even if

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.149 
where my conversational voice is even if
I<00:05:09.599> yell<00:05:09.840> into<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.229> mic<00:05:10.409> it's<00:05:10.680> gonna<00:05:10.830> cut<00:05:11.129> down

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
I yell into the mic it's gonna cut down

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.129 
I yell into the mic it's gonna cut down
so<00:05:12.029> you<00:05:12.090> won't<00:05:12.419> have<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.749> worry<00:05:12.960> about

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
so you won't have to worry about

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.529 
so you won't have to worry about
offending<00:05:13.770> your<00:05:14.520> artists<00:05:14.939> ears<00:05:15.210> with<00:05:15.509> your

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
offending your artists ears with your

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.860 
offending your artists ears with your
cue<00:05:15.870> mix<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.430> potentially<00:05:17.719> making<00:05:18.719> them

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
cue mix and potentially making them

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.510 
cue mix and potentially making them
angry<00:05:19.080> because<00:05:19.529> you<00:05:19.710> ruined<00:05:19.919> their<00:05:20.189> hearing

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
angry because you ruined their hearing

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.989 
angry because you ruined their hearing
for<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:20.819> day<00:05:21.499> anyway<00:05:22.499> I<00:05:22.770> hope<00:05:23.639> this<00:05:23.819> is

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:23.999 
for the day anyway I hope this is

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:27.290 
for the day anyway I hope this is

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
helpful and I hope they actually do

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.019 
helpful and I hope they actually do
release<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.810> plug-in<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:28.439> 64-bit<00:05:29.069> ax<00:05:29.729> but

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
release the plug-in and 64-bit ax but

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.879 
release the plug-in and 64-bit ax but
until<00:05:30.300> they<00:05:30.449> do<00:05:30.509> here's<00:05:30.990> a<00:05:31.050> small<00:05:31.349> workaround

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
until they do here's a small workaround
