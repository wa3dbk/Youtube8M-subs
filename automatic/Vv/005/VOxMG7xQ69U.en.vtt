00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.020
 swiss tennis 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.910
 hi the sixties university montreal 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.770
 Julie exists 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.510
 show ambitious in working 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 nanocrystalline cellulose to make me to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 you have the future like any of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.309
 box jean bouchard an enthusiastic who 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.480
 is fascinated the macroscopic baggies 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.399
 happy friborg when in our 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 process and it's going to be the same 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.960
 the factory when you get the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.370
 nanocrystalline cellulose are formed 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 questions are hanging in the water 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.469
 like in the bottle here where we see 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.079
 that it is a little packed sanÃ© these traces 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.850
 per year here about 2% of our 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 story in the water it gives a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 certain viscosity but it's a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 colloids indefinitely stable 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.930
 that is to say that even if the crises all 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.189
 are solid particles will not fall 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.049
 not in the background she stays in 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.640
 suspension because they have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.290
 negative charges on their surface and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.259
 that they are so small that they 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.549
 hold to suspensions without being 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.119
 dissolves his strong knees into 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.450
 suspension 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.790
 when dry happen for the purpose 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.880
 to apply it elsewhere or for the purpose 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.189
 of impact and to distribute it had 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.009
 we get this kind of white powder 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.540
 there that are a little like so- called slats and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.369
 very light crystals and who who by a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.079
 process that was discovered here at fp 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.149
 narration when I spend writing sony 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.549
 that remedies to support us years 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.829
 but they will disperse in question 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 individual and I will see get the 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.460
 suspension as starting 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 we can also have steps 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.080
 intermediaries that is to say that here I 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.140
 2% in our cells to water it 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.060
 sounds to turn its 100% to 20 % of 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.890
 nanocellulose in the water and well 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.490
 the appearance is a bit like the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
 vaseline 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.340
 it's a semi solid gilles favor it 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.459
 semi solid gel here we are at a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.709
 concentration of 20% of which 80% of water in 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.380
 seven of these young people is that we can 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.860
 think of a lot of applications 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.120
 medical or chemical in which one 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.670
 introduced a product that can be a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.709
 drug a hormone inside the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.680
 gel like nanocellulose is a 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.890
 compound that causes no reaction from 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.140
 dermatology or all these are the verify 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.940
 and it could be a support for 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.049
 drugs and things like that it 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.269
 does research at the level 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:46.410
 University on the applications of 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.239
 nanocellulose gels and nbc last 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.810
 property I wanted you to 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.180
 mention li nanocrystals here are 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.190
 in the water a little ordered as good their 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 breast as I leave 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.359
 choose to evaporate the water and reduce the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.209
 volume they will become a bit when 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.880
 even a little uncomfortable people towards 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.290
 the others and yvan align themselves in blood this 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.570
 door to Nimes this is called 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.079
 the self assembly and it's a property 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.280
 quite unique to nanomaterials as 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.320
 nanos crisis all these places that have 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.329
 forms of aiguilhe and when dried 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.620
 has self assembled there what we 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.959
 gets 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.060
 it's almost transparent films but 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.070
 which are iridescent you can see by 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.320
 the mask by varying the viewing angles 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.720
 we change the color of the film 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.640
 then there are optical applications to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.220
 exterior decorative applications 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.530
 my really technical applications that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.270
 is interesting in industries 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.190
 as 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.270
 the worm the automobile the textile or 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.170
 to have specific barriers to 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.170
 certain light wavelengths 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.600
 are important these batch crystals are 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.660
 responsible for the strength of the art of 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.970
 strength of the wood and when one is able 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.860
 the extras because sp innovation has 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.570
 nothing invented here the bed crystals are 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.890
 made by nature 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.690
 that's why for that matter who are so 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.930
 good we what we do is we have 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.110
 managed to extract them from the weight and the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.330
 force to be a bag it not because they 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.730
 are stronger than steel 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.020
 if we add them to another product 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.140
 it can be a varnish it can be a 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.240
 plastic countries over bags 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.490
 packaging so for example we can 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.080
 think of a plastic structure that 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.570
 would be 30% stronger with an addition of 1 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.810
 or 2% in our cells or if it is 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.010
 30% stronger for the function 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.130
 wants him to assume this means 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.680
 we can reduce to 30% and 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.590
 would get the membrane hand so there 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.420
 we do not move and part of 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.030
 plastic produced from oil 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.480
 which is a non- renewable product by 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.520
 a substance that renewed and in addition 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.900
 we have a drop in weight which means 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.220
 that for example in the industry 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.130
 automotive industry 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.260
 aeronautics or weight reduction 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.750
 vehicles or planes is 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.990
 extremely important and gold have filled 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.990
 our mission
