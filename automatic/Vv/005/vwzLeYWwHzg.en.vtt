 chocolate cake in the microwave for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.190

 fresh thick and half a spoon to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.269
 yeast coffee for frosting 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.640
 we need 110 g dark chocolate 50 g 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.590
 of white chocolate 20 g of butter a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.420
 tablespoon icing sugar 2 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.690
 tablespoons of cream and 2 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 tablespoons of water of course 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.840
 will do everything a microwave but no 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.190
 panic if you do not have a microwave you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.910
 can also do everything on plates and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.829
 bake it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.000
 we take the chocolate we will cut it 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.379
 in pieces go add one 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.539
 tablespoon cold water next is 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 gone for a cooking minutes to 500 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:00.899
 watts for mixing vividly for good 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.460
 to melt the chocolate we add the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.830
 butter once the butter has been added 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.630
 whisking hard until you 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 get a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.280
 the mixture is very smooth we will be able 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.720
 stay as a result of the operations 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.820
 the yeast is mixed with flour is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.530
 will mix the eggs with the sugar 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.729
 so I have cassin bas rhin in a small 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.460
 bowl before to make sure they 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 are fresh I add sugar and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.799
 I do not have a mixture and the child 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 I take a choice that served me 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.770
 for sticking like that it keeps me from 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.770
 make too much salt after 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.840
 a study to mix too long that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.580
 we do not want the mixture 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.730
 whiten and then add the cream 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.730
 fresh 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.360
 now it's time for flour 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.220
 enters the track always mixing 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.550
 center to the edge to incorporate well 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.170
 the flour as I add 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.170
 this time the chocolate mix 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.390
 the dough is ready we will be able to the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 put in the mold 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.110
 so of course it's a silicone mold 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.110
 which goes to the micron 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.860
 it's gone for 5 to 6 minutes 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.110
 cooking maximum power if you do not have 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.900
 of my fangs you can do very well 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.720
 bake your cake in the oven at 180 Â° 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.180
 35 minutes and that's what it gives 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.890
 for out of the oven will now be the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.849
 and it's a little cool 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.489
 and during that time we will do this 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.099
 spent a greasing for icing and a 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.450
 little changed the quantities in order to have 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.129
 a frosting that is a little bit 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.140
 less liquid and so it is more 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.150
 easy to spread we do not beat a team 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.359
 who wins we will continue with the microphone 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.680
 wave 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:49.200
 we will first melt the chocolate 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.200
 black we add water icing sugar 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.810
 we mix to melt the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.670
 chocolate we will add the cut butter 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.370
 in pieces and we mix to do it 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.370
 melt world adds plate the soul fresh 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.400
 street unmold cake we will be able 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 spread over the chocolate icing 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.290
 black of course the simplest when 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.120
 we lose frosting is to put ourselves on 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.030
 a grid like that all the excess of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.470
 chocolate makhoul underneath right there otherwise 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.840
 just do how to be challenged on 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.790
 around and we get a cake 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.650
 absolutely beautiful and all icy 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.420
 but we can go even further 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.010
 that's why I pulled out the chocolate 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 white we're going to melt it to make 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.599
 sets on our ice 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.519
 go to the microwave power 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.709
 minimum with a few drops of water and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.840
 there we go for 15 months maximum 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.519
 we will put a little bit if it takes after 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.120
 because white chocolate is very 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.790
 very fragile 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.019
 white chocolate has trouble melt was 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.360
 just a little bit of cream and this 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.100
 will be much easier 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.880
 so to be able to decorate I put in 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.290
 a piping bag 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.180
 so me it's a piping bag 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.840
 improvised since it's a bag 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.920
 freezing 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.920
 I will cut the end 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.849
 he 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.300
 we just have to wait until the frosting 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.430
 be taken for muscular and that's it 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.780
 a recipe that should feast more 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.150
 of a he will say that it was hot at the microphone 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.190
 wave 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.960
 hard to believe and yet it's 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.760
 true also if you want another 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.350
 delicious recipe at the micron cave 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.530
 invites to make the timbales of jeanne 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.430
 smoked salmon zucchini mousse 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.530
 you'll tell me news for a 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.110
 Another easy recipe and quick appointment 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.669

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.620
 who does not want to miss there is a council 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:52.050
 subscribe to the mid- range chain 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.510
 way between the whip the masseur and he 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.610
 must be said the pays the whip the 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.200
 ball is handy for stirring very 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.220
 strongly chocolate once he 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.220
 out of the microwave go go it's gone
