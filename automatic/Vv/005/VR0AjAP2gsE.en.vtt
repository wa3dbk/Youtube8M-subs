then<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:43.000> went<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.330> down<00:03:43.570> into<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.990> local

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
then we went just down into the local

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.220 
then we went just down into the local
black<00:03:45.790> sand<00:03:46.060> beach<00:03:46.270> and<00:03:46.480> had<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.600> swim<00:03:46.750> offshore

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
black sand beach and had a swim offshore

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
black sand beach and had a swim offshore
and<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.860> waters<00:03:48.220> there<00:03:48.490> are<00:03:48.670> actually<00:03:49.030> warm

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
and the waters there are actually warm

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.930 
and the waters there are actually warm
because<00:03:49.600> they're<00:03:49.960> being<00:03:50.140> cooled<00:03:50.470> by<00:03:50.850> some<00:03:51.850> of

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
because they're being cooled by some of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.400 
because they're being cooled by some of
the<00:03:52.000> volcanic<00:03:52.300> heat<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.170> was<00:03:53.290> quite

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
the volcanic heat so that was quite

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.590 
the volcanic heat so that was quite
exciting<00:03:53.790> there<00:03:54.790> are<00:03:54.910> some<00:03:55.060> River<00:03:55.270> gorges

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
exciting there are some River gorges

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.620 
exciting there are some River gorges
that<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:55.990> actually<00:03:56.260> been<00:03:56.290> formed<00:03:56.770> through

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
that have actually been formed through

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.760 
that have actually been formed through
cracks<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:59.830> when<00:04:00.490> when<00:04:00.730> volcanoes<00:04:01.300> cool<00:04:01.770> and

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
cracks in when when volcanoes cool and

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.860 
cracks in when when volcanoes cool and
you've<00:04:02.890> got<00:04:03.040> some<00:04:03.250> really<00:04:04.060> beautifully<00:04:04.570> clear

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
you've got some really beautifully clear

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.830 
you've got some really beautifully clear
river<00:04:05.200> water<00:04:05.560> running<00:04:05.950> through<00:04:06.220> these<00:04:06.520> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
river water running through these and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.600 
river water running through these and
carving<00:04:07.840> out<00:04:07.960> some<00:04:07.990> fantastic<00:04:08.770> scenery<00:04:09.010> and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610

I<00:05:38.280> think<00:05:38.520> Sicily<00:05:39.060> is<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.600> good<00:05:40.500> option<00:05:40.710> in<00:05:41.190> terms

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
I think Sicily is a good option in terms

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.760 
I think Sicily is a good option in terms
of<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.729> school<00:05:41.940> party<00:05:42.300> visit<00:05:42.600> what<00:05:43.440> we<00:05:43.560> like<00:05:43.740> to

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
of a school party visit what we like to

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.200 
of a school party visit what we like to
do<00:05:43.979> is<00:05:44.130> mix<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.430> up<00:05:44.580> you<00:05:44.789> know<00:05:44.880> we've<00:05:45.030> had<00:05:45.150> a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
do is mix it up you know we've had a

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.390 
do is mix it up you know we've had a
couple<00:05:45.720> of<00:05:45.870> years<00:05:46.110> in<00:05:46.289> the<00:05:46.380> Alps<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.280> we

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
couple of years in the Alps and we

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.189 
couple of years in the Alps and we
decided<00:05:47.850> on<00:05:47.940> Sicily<00:05:48.360> this<00:05:48.510> year<00:05:48.720> I<00:05:48.750> think<00:05:48.960> we

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
decided on Sicily this year I think we

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.510 
decided on Sicily this year I think we
certainly<00:05:49.470> will<00:05:49.620> be<00:05:49.740> using<00:05:50.010> it<00:05:50.100> as<00:05:50.220> a<00:05:50.250> base<00:05:50.460> for

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
certainly will be using it as a base for

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.210 
certainly will be using it as a base for
a<00:05:51.150> couple<00:05:51.600> more<00:05:51.720> years<00:05:51.780> before<00:05:52.620> we<00:05:52.919> may<00:05:53.070> look

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
a couple more years before we may look

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.820 
a couple more years before we may look
at<00:05:53.370> another<00:05:54.199> country<00:05:55.199> or<00:05:55.349> another<00:05:55.470> place
