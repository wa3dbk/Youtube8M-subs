we call HTC One m9 plus for sake of

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.069 
we call HTC One m9 plus for sake of
simplicity<00:01:20.439> but<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.609> could<00:01:22.450> turn<00:01:22.659> out<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.049> be

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
simplicity but it could turn out to be
