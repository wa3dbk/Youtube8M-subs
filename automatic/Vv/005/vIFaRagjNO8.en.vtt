00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 myself and the most important thing for me now 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 the challenge is to grow hair i started 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 grow hair since February 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.109
 I last cut my hair and more 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.990
 I will not get a haircut but I want to remind 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.380
 if you want to grow hair then 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 would be necessary every two months 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.900
 cut the ends so that the hair does not 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.270
 split further and also exist 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.170
 some rules they are pretty easy in 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 performance 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.590
 in order to enhance hair growth i 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.530
 found these rules i will try them and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.200
 I want to tell you about them too so that you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 also tried and we did this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 a kind of experiment then 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 shared feedback from someone for what 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.129
 period for example how long has grown 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.770
 hair who has a month for a centimeter 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.770
 who for a month by 3 centimeters who what 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.960
 the case is that way and move on 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.360
 proper to the rules you need 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.420
 observe in order to make hair faster 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 grew the first rule and very important 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.509
 always everywhere is food nutrition and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.159
 vitamins for hair really need vitamins 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.590
 and trace elements 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.479
 therefore, it is advised to eat fruits and vegetables 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.939
 walnuts 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.360
 bean eggs to speed up 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.100
 hair growth is also highly advised to eat 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 cabbage and carrot which is contained 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 beta carotene which is also very good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.530
 affects hair growth 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.649
 that is, the first and most important rule is 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 nutrition healthy nutrition second no less 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.860
 the important rule is to drink a lot of water 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 each person should drink about 30 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.719
 grams per kilogram of weight but in principle 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.380
 can drink up to 2 liters of water 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.829
 still carbon filtered 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.590
 that is, up to two liters in order to 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.450
 organism toxins out if we will 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.420
 drink plenty of water our skin will be more 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.680
 moisturized and hair, respectively 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.019
 will be moistened and 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.300
 and will not be so dried it too 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.130
 enhance hair growth third very helpful 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.870
 and the simple rule is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.599
 accent hair shower 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.900
 that is, when you wash your head do not need 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.269
 wash your hair with very hot water wash 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.750
 hair with warm water, wash off the shampoo 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.030
 warm water and then at the end just 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.890
 rinse all the hairs with cool water 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.690
 in order to stimulate the bulbs 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.410
 this will also increase growth accordingly 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 hair 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.910
 4 and a very important item is a mask for 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.849
 hair growth 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.630
 every week make masks for growth 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.090
 hair 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.260
 there are so many masks on my channel 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.769
 for hair growth 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 you can alternate these masks but they can not 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.599
 do more than once a week because 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.410
 we can dry out the hair 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.709
 the fifth rule is this rule certainly not 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.579
 very easy to do even for me 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.040
 need to quit smoking 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.329
 or at least reduce the amount 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.780
 cigarettes smoked 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.370
 it is very very negative for our 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.590
 skin on the scalp and on the face 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.910
 teeth and everything else ie cigarettes 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.829
 need to forget something to quit 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.799
 the rule is healthy sleep each 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.549
 self-respecting beautiful girl should 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.569
 to pay 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.600

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.260
 air out before bed 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.060
 room to breathe easier 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.840
 and all slept well 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.930
 8 number we are with him every day 7 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.550

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.660
 remind the seventh rule is to avoid 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.319
 tight hairstyles 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.769
 avoid tight gum pins which 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.769
 pull out hair less often try to wear 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:13.290

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:16.930
 that is, do everything to hair 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.609
 breathed the more often they breathe and the better 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.910
 there will be hair growth 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.070

 wet i'm cold air give them 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.120

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.570
