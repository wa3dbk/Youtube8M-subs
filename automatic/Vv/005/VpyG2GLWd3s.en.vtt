would<00:02:47.500> love<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:49.030> happening<00:02:49.600> right<00:02:49.780> in

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
would love to see happening right in

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.039 
would love to see happening right in
front<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.380> them<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.799> you<00:02:51.760> can't<00:02:52.060> can't<00:02:52.780> just

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
front of them and you can't can't just

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.690 
front of them and you can't can't just
organize<00:02:53.560> those<00:02:53.769> kind<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.130> things<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.579> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
organize those kind of things on the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.569 
organize those kind of things on the
minute<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.030> want<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.269> see<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.930> know<00:02:56.579> you

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
it's hanging and sometimes you wish you

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's hanging and sometimes you wish you
didn't<00:03:31.280> know<00:03:31.690> has<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.870> happened<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.260> you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
said that's what you not really not

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.050 
said that's what you not really not
really<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:41.090> got<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.600> say<00:03:41.780> something<00:03:42.880> when<00:03:43.880> this

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
really I got to say something when this

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.550 
really I got to say something when this
one<00:03:44.240> guy<00:03:44.420> had<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.630> big<00:03:44.810> painting<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.350> pool

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
one guy had a big painting in the pool

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.860 
one guy had a big painting in the pool
house<00:03:45.800> but<00:03:46.640> then<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:46.850> realized<00:03:47.240> for<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.540> people

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
house but then I realized for the people

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.170 
house but then I realized for the people
that<00:03:48.020> lived<00:03:48.800> there<00:03:48.890> they're<00:03:49.760> always<00:03:49.940> out

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
that lived there they're always out

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.790 
that lived there they're always out
there<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.810> pool<00:03:50.990> house<00:03:51.200> was<00:03:51.380> always<00:03:51.650> open

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
there and the pool house was always open

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.860 
there and the pool house was always open
and<00:03:52.070> at<00:03:52.190> night<00:03:52.370> they've<00:03:52.640> got<00:03:52.850> guests<00:03:53.660> coming

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
and at night they've got guests coming

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.630 
and at night they've got guests coming
in<00:03:54.110> and<00:03:54.260> having<00:03:54.380> cocktails<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.460> and

in and having cocktails and this and
that<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.090> probably<00:03:56.840> looks<00:03:57.260> really<00:03:57.560> cool

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
that and it probably looks really cool

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.280 
that and it probably looks really cool
in<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.220> thing<00:03:59.210> but<00:03:59.420> when<00:03:59.570> you're<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.930> artist

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
in that thing but when you're the artist

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.230 
in that thing but when you're the artist
and<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.590> go<00:04:00.740> to<00:04:01.340> visit<00:04:01.520> and<00:04:01.820> you<00:04:01.850> see<00:04:02.090> the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
and you go to visit and you see the

and you go to visit and you see the
beautiful<00:04:02.540> home<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.320> then<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.560> realize<00:04:03.860> I'm

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
beautiful home and then you realize I'm

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.310 
beautiful home and then you realize I'm
in<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.280> pool<00:04:04.550> house<00:04:04.790> yeah<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.050> you're

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
in the pool house yeah and you're

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.060 
in the pool house yeah and you're
looking<00:04:06.620> at<00:04:06.740> rest<00:04:06.920> for<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:08.590> might<00:04:09.590> as<00:04:09.740> well<00:04:09.890> go

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
looking at rest for it might as well go

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:38.910 
looking at rest for it might as well go
swimming

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.030 

and<00:04:39.920> if<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.160> had<00:04:40.340> 50<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:40.910> these<00:04:41.120> things<00:04:41.950> you<00:04:42.950> know

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
and if I had 50 of these things you know

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.620 
and if I had 50 of these things you know
I'd<00:04:43.280> take<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.670> down<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.000> just<00:04:44.060> leave<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.360> like

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
I'd take it down and just leave it like

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.890 
I'd take it down and just leave it like
that<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.530> fact<00:04:45.800> is<00:04:46.040> is<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:47.570> minute<00:04:47.840> you

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
that but the fact is is the minute you

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.800 
that but the fact is is the minute you
take<00:04:48.110> them<00:04:48.260> off<00:04:48.440> them<00:04:48.680> they<00:04:49.240> become<00:04:50.240> dangerous

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
take them off them they become dangerous

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.450 
take them off them they become dangerous
like<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.410> lines<00:04:51.650> could<00:04:51.980> get<00:04:52.130> smudged

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
like the lines could get smudged

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.430 
like the lines could get smudged
everything<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.180> alive<00:04:53.510> on<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.230> the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
everything is alive on the on the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.100 
everything is alive on the on the
surface<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:55.490> have<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.210> trained<00:04:56.540> yourself<00:04:56.720> to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
surface so have you trained yourself to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.590 
surface so have you trained yourself to
be<00:04:57.260> really<00:04:58.130> careful<00:04:58.580> about<00:04:58.610> what<00:04:59.300> like<00:04:59.480> when

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
be really careful about what like when

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.570 
be really careful about what like when
you're<00:04:59.750> working<00:04:59.840> well<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.860> notice<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.340> didn't

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
you're working well you notice I didn't

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.090 
you're working well you notice I didn't
get<00:05:01.700> any<00:05:01.850> hand<00:05:02.150> prints<00:05:02.480> anywhere<00:05:02.950> except<00:05:03.950> for

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
get any hand prints anywhere except for

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.130 
get any hand prints anywhere except for
there<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.610> I<00:05:05.270> might<00:05:05.480> have<00:05:05.630> got<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:05.930> when<00:05:06.110> I

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
there and I might have got that when I

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.650 
there and I might have got that when I
was<00:05:06.350> pushing<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.040> that<00:05:07.160> was<00:05:07.340> about<00:05:07.550> it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
was pushing that in that was about it

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.240 
was pushing that in that was about it
but<00:05:08.660> that's<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.080> tricky<00:05:09.380> thing<00:05:09.590> why<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.890> think

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
but that's the tricky thing why I think

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.370 
but that's the tricky thing why I think
you<00:05:10.640> can't<00:05:10.910> just<00:05:11.000> sit<00:05:11.419> there<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:11.750> say<00:05:12.140> how
