00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.630 
it was yeah like if anything I feel like
the<00:04:59.350> game<00:04:59.590> should<00:04:59.800> have<00:04:59.860> been<00:05:00.040> that<00:05:00.190> way<00:05:00.370> and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
the game should have been that way and

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.120 
the game should have been that way and
you<00:05:01.450> know<00:05:01.480> maybe<00:05:02.080> our<00:05:02.380> character<00:05:02.800> could<00:05:02.919> do<00:05:03.040> it

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
you know maybe our character could do it

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.370 
you know maybe our character could do it
would<00:05:03.310> be<00:05:03.340> unique<00:05:03.610> yeah<00:05:04.270> but<00:05:04.450> if<00:05:04.720> everybody

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
would be unique yeah but if everybody

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.210 
would be unique yeah but if everybody
could<00:05:05.530> do<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.770> just<00:05:05.919> seems<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.130> little

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220
