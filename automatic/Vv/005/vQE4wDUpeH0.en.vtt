00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.480
 to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.480
 i 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.610
 between the preparations that is made wall 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.930
 that art here first of all have the 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:53.220
 Beware that the spotlights are wet and 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.040
 put us in a shed 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.890
 second separate them by colors and 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.559
 population for what 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 to be able to dodge a white white and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.960
 the colors colors apart so that they do not 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.119
 are contaminated between colors in the tour 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 of the minimum alpaca must measure for 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.890
 shearing 7 centimeters 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.090
 on the beach the corner should be 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.090
 clean to avoid contamination of 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 the fiber with lows with other grasses 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.900
 the materials that should be used 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.480
 first you must be sharp scissors the 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.440
 obstacles and legislator 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.890
 a record in iodine is like in the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.890
 foods 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.060
 some bags and the canvas 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.870
 the alpacas clean the senses and a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.210
 helmet discover everything from the head 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.800
 up to the foot everything that is at your 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:12.670
 select with earth this is for shearing 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 then after cleaning everything already 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.209
 he gets the lock and there he is 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.720
 the legs are locked and then the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.990
 hands 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:29.250
 then the shearing begins first 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:34.250
 the cloak is removed and leaving the panties 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:39.150
 He still does not start on his behalf 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.850
 it's special care left in the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.430
 uniform uniformed loss cut 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.890
 everything in this mixed bike where it prevents 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 do not in fiber either in the tycoon 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.570
 that is in the other defense and that the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.240
 evolution to this uniform line and there 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.110
 to be careful you can suddenly the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.670
 earthquake and is to tell you in this measure 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 so as not to cut your skin that has 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.660
 consolidated from the father move 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.630
 we can count a time then if not 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.490
 We cut ipad is we have our our 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.790
 to cure him enough we have everything 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.370
 prepared 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.610
 to him 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.670
 it is beautiful a complete is blanket after 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.390
 the waters to avoid pollution 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.900
 which one should be more careful because 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.880
 sometimes and infinity the new ones to the mind 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.880
 and it's difficult to be able to classify 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.880
 When you finish shearing everything 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.040
 releases the animal recommendations with the 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.620
 panties would be that at the time of 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.450
 to shear them out of carved out there 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.250
 to put him to the base so he does not 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.250
 can infiltrate the mantle 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.740
 open the entire mantle and then you 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.420
 pulls out all all that all 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.860
 large ones that have still remained and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.950
 then the mantle is made like this makes it 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.650
 crossing the two parts I do not feel that 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.930
 shape with an alpha removes hair 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.799
 fold when more paquita is forming 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.970
 I feel bends from the foot of the belly the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.470
 arm everything is doubled twice and then it 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.290
 begins 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.100
 to the third in a little of the neck and 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.400
 after the tail of the part of the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.670
 tail starts to roll 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.940
 like a tambo sito 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:46.650
 and then you read and do it reaches you 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.650
 neck and with a collar is assured 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.490
 after that this 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.959
 the little drum gets his voice in the 

00:04:53.989 --> 00:05:00.499
 panties previously new treatments psa 

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:02.500
 each of them and then tie the 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:05.380
 two said stars 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.320
 after starting I still think that already 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.060
 we have the records to be able to water 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.240
 we notice how much is bouncing how many 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.330
 books that to know what is 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.849
 have if it's okay 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.969
 good prey our underweight 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.719
 after finishing and we have to have 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:29.750
 a jute to be useful to be able 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:32.540
 put it and already to be able to store it 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.230
 you have to store a lot of time in the 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:41.450
 fiber because the moth can not eat 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:46.370
 both you can go and also lose 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:50.870
 the fiber weight because the weight of 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.660
 according to the humidity also in the climate 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.770
 the more moisture there is the row weighs and 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:01.910
 when the humidity is gone also the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.120
 fibers becomes dry and recommended us 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.120
 talk
