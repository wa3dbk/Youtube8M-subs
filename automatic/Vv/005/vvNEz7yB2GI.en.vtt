if<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.570> hoisting<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.050> spinnaker<00:01:22.380> without

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
if you're hoisting the spinnaker without

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
if you're hoisting the spinnaker without

then<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.680> idea<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.310> leave<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> jib

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
then it's a good idea to leave the jib

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.790 
then it's a good idea to leave the jib
in<00:01:27.149> place<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> hoist<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.289> behind<00:01:28.649> the

in place and hoist it from behind the

in place and hoist it from behind the
jib<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.250> acting<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.789> blanket<00:01:30.440> stopping<00:01:31.440> the
