measuring to the knock out our hole in
the<00:00:46.120> bumper<00:00:46.270> fascia<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:47.380> we're<00:00:47.500> gonna<00:00:47.590> start

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
the bumper fascia and we're gonna start

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.950 
the bumper fascia and we're gonna start
with<00:00:47.950> a<00:00:48.010> common<00:00:48.430> measurement<00:00:48.960> basically

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
with a common measurement basically

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.120 
with a common measurement basically
we're<00:00:50.080> gonna<00:00:50.200> start<00:00:50.440> from<00:00:50.560> this<00:00:50.710> bolt<00:00:50.980> right

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
we're gonna start from this bolt right

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.590 
we're gonna start from this bolt right
here<00:00:51.190> we're<00:00:51.520> Center<00:00:51.760> wrist<00:00:51.910> bolt<00:00:52.150> we're<00:00:52.480> gonna

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
here we're Center wrist bolt we're gonna

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.570 
here we're Center wrist bolt we're gonna
measure<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.989> down<00:00:53.290> to<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.559> ground<00:00:53.830> and<00:00:54.070> get<00:00:54.550> a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
measure it down to the ground and get a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.670 
measure it down to the ground and get a
reference<00:00:54.910> point<00:00:55.090> from<00:00:55.270> there<00:00:55.510> okay<00:00:56.470> we<00:00:56.559> got

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
reference point from there okay we got

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.470 
reference point from there okay we got
our<00:00:56.770> measurement<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.970> our<00:00:58.090> case<00:00:58.300> that

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
our measurement and in our case that

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.660 
our measurement and in our case that
came<00:00:58.660> out<00:00:58.750> with<00:00:58.840> 26<00:00:59.290> inches<00:00:59.620> of<00:01:00.250> course<00:01:00.460> might

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
came out with 26 inches of course might

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.549 
came out with 26 inches of course might
vary<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.150> then<00:01:01.480> our<00:01:01.600> next<00:01:01.780> step<00:01:02.140> is<00:01:02.320> to

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
vary and then our next step is to

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.180 
vary and then our next step is to
subtract<00:01:02.950> 3/4<00:01:03.700> of<00:01:03.730> an<00:01:03.820> inch<00:01:03.940> as<00:01:04.839> well<00:01:04.900> gives<00:01:05.290> 25

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
subtract 3/4 of an inch as well gives 25

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.670 
subtract 3/4 of an inch as well gives 25
and<00:01:06.520> 1/4<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:07.930> need<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.200> mark<00:01:08.470> that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
and 1/4 and we need to mark that

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.410 
and 1/4 and we need to mark that
difference<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.790> front<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.150> pressure

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
difference to the front of the pressure

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.160 
difference to the front of the pressure
down<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.560> ground<00:01:12.570> next<00:01:13.570> mark<00:01:13.869> we<00:01:14.020> got<00:01:14.050> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
down to the ground next mark we got a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.090 
down to the ground next mark we got a
measure<00:01:14.410> from<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:17.020> three<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> quarter

I<00:04:32.020> actually<00:04:32.290> our<00:04:32.620> fits<00:04:33.130> up<00:04:33.280> there<00:04:33.430> snug

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
I actually our fits up there snug

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.180 
I actually our fits up there snug
without<00:04:34.150> any<00:04:34.510> washers<00:04:34.960> whatsoever<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.950> we're

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
without any washers whatsoever so we're

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.080 
without any washers whatsoever so we're
going<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.370> go<00:04:36.490> ahead<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.820> just<00:04:36.910> start

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
going to go ahead and just start

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.030 
going to go ahead and just start
installing<00:04:37.479> our<00:04:37.690> hardware<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.260> most<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.979> this

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
installing our hardware and most of this

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.379 
installing our hardware and most of this
does<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.430> whole<00:04:39.760> be<00:04:39.940> off<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.120> little<00:04:40.210> bit

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
does this whole be off a little bit

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.850 
does this whole be off a little bit
off-center<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.080> so<00:04:41.320> now<00:04:41.470> we'll<00:04:41.620> take<00:04:41.800> a

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
off-center and so now we'll take a

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.710 
off-center and so now we'll take a
measurement<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.520> we'll<00:04:42.790> see<00:04:43.150> how<00:04:43.270> far<00:04:43.450> we<00:04:43.510> can

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
measurement and we'll see how far we can

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.120 
measurement and we'll see how far we can
match<00:04:44.020> up<00:04:44.229> on<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.500> effect<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.919> makes<00:04:45.040> it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
match up on the in effect it makes it

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.659 
match up on the in effect it makes it
nice<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.280> easy

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
nice and easy

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.300 
nice and easy
next<00:04:46.570> we'll<00:04:46.720> install<00:04:46.870> our<00:04:47.110> hardware<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:48.100> goes

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
next we'll install our hardware it goes

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.240 
next we'll install our hardware it goes
