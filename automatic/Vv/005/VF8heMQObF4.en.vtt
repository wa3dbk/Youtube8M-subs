couple weeks in Portland Oregon and I'm
focusing<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.150> dkw<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.410> doesn't<00:00:16.680> have

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800

focusing here on my dkw it doesn't have
a<00:00:16.830> windshield<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> had<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439

weather and one thing that's perplexing
me<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.939> long<00:00:24.390> time<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> expansion<00:00:25.740> chamber

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
me a long time was the expansion chamber

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
me a long time was the expansion chamber
it's<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> last<00:00:27.630> pieces<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.260> the

actually<00:00:34.680> runs<00:00:34.950> pretty<00:00:35.130> good<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.809> demonstrated

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
actually runs pretty good I demonstrated

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.060 
actually runs pretty good I demonstrated
that<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.050> another<00:00:37.200> video

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

however<00:00:40.100> angel<00:00:41.100> touched<00:00:41.280> me<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.969> last<00:00:42.210> week

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
however angel touched me this last week

however angel touched me this last week
and<00:00:43.340> I<00:00:44.340> now<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:45.500> an<00:00:46.520> expansion<00:00:47.520> chamber<00:00:48.000> I've

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
and I now have an expansion chamber I've

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.670 
and I now have an expansion chamber I've
never<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.079> seen<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.950> before<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
never actually seen one before this is

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.299 
never actually seen one before this is
this<00:00:52.680> broken<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.559> only<00:00:56.010> part

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
this broken one here is the only part

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.849 
this broken one here is the only part
that<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.640> ever<00:00:56.760> seen<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> dkw<00:00:58.379> expansion

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that I've ever seen for a dkw expansion

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.599 
that I've ever seen for a dkw expansion
chamber<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.670> a<00:01:00.050> double<00:01:01.050> line<00:01:01.609> thermally

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
chamber and it's a double line thermally

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
chamber and it's a double line thermally
wrapped<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.090> see<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.329> thick<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.750> has

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
wrapped you can see how thick this has

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
wrapped you can see how thick this has
got<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.769> inner<00:01:04.949> liner<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:05.549> outer

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
got like an inner liner and an outer

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
got like an inner liner and an outer
liner<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.840> probably<00:01:07.170> asbestos<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.890> imagine

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
liner it's probably asbestos I imagine

all<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.170> heat<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.560> there's<00:01:13.070> well

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
all to do with the heat and there's well

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
all to do with the heat and there's well
it's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> bunch<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.640> mystery<00:01:14.970> voodoo<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
it's a bunch of mystery voodoo is what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's a bunch of mystery voodoo is what
it<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.560> how<00:01:16.650> long<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> expansion

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it is that's how long that expansion

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.300 
it is that's how long that expansion
pipe<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.470> three<00:01:19.470> feet<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.770> just

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
pipe is that's a good three feet on just

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.480 
pipe is that's a good three feet on just
that<00:01:20.460> section<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:21.380> inside<00:01:22.380> here<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.280> are

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
that section there inside here there are

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.749 
that section there inside here there are
just<00:01:23.729> plates<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.680> standard<00:01:25.680> plates<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.310> don't

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
just plates just standard plates I don't

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.830 
just plates just standard plates I don't
understand<00:01:27.090> how<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> works<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.340> exhaust

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
understand how it works but the exhaust

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.149 
understand how it works but the exhaust
pipe<00:01:30.840> ramps<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.590> slowly

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
pipe ramps up slowly

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.560 
pipe ramps up slowly
you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.460> tapers<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> normal

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you know tapers up just like a normal

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
you know tapers up just like a normal
expansion<00:01:34.140> chamber<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> bike<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.250> something

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
expansion chamber on a bike or something

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.760 
expansion chamber on a bike or something
and<00:01:35.670> then<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.360> hits<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> plate<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and then it just hits a plate like in a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
and then it just hits a plate like in a
couple<00:01:38.009> different<00:01:38.100> places<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.780> guess

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
couple different places and I guess

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
couple different places and I guess
that's<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.470> you've<00:01:41.009> got<00:01:41.220> three

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that's because you've got three

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.880 
that's because you've got three
cylinders<00:01:41.970> feeding<00:01:42.299> into<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.890> something

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
cylinders feeding into one something

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.080 
cylinders feeding into one something
about<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.659> harmonics<00:01:45.659> or<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.530> pulses<00:01:47.280> or<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
about the harmonics or the pulses or the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.319 
about the harmonics or the pulses or the
tuning<00:01:49.100> that's<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> cat's<00:01:50.430> meow<00:01:50.579> four<00:01:50.970> three

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tuning that's the cat's meow four three

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
tuning that's the cat's meow four three
into<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> try<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.619> I'm

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
into one so I'm going to try this I'm

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.300 
into one so I'm going to try this I'm
really<00:01:53.100> excited<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.890> may<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.040> some

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
really excited and I may make some

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
really excited and I may make some
copies<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.020> because<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.229> such<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> hard

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
copies just because it's such a hard

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.100 
copies just because it's such a hard
piece<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> find<00:01:59.189> so<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.479> pipe<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
piece to find so this pipe here the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.609 
piece to find so this pipe here the
