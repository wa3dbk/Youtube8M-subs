many<00:00:02.810> people<00:00:02.960> request<00:00:03.560> information<00:00:04.279> from<00:00:04.790> us

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
many people request information from us

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.139 
many people request information from us
because<00:00:05.270> we're<00:00:05.479> a<00:00:05.509> research<00:00:05.899> center<00:00:06.379> and<00:00:07.149> the

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
because we're a research center and the

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.850 
because we're a research center and the
questions<00:00:08.510> that<00:00:08.600> typically<00:00:09.019> come<00:00:09.320> up<00:00:09.500> are

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
questions that typically come up are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.210 
questions that typically come up are
what<00:00:10.760> should<00:00:11.000> i<00:00:11.150> do<00:00:11.210> differently<00:00:12.220> because

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
what should i do differently because

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.070 
what should i do differently because
things<00:00:13.670> have<00:00:13.850> been<00:00:13.970> offered<00:00:14.450> that<00:00:14.630> our<00:00:14.780> quote

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
things have been offered that our quote

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.109 
things have been offered that our quote
standard<00:00:15.620> of<00:00:15.860> care<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.460> is<00:00:16.640> there<00:00:16.789> something

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
standard of care and is there something

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.740 
standard of care and is there something
else<00:00:17.269> to<00:00:17.810> be<00:00:17.960> done<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.410> I<00:00:19.220> try<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:19.750> ask

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
else to be done and I try and ask

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.750 
else to be done and I try and ask
patients<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:21.650> think<00:00:21.950> very<00:00:22.010> carefully<00:00:22.460> about

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
patients to think very carefully about

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.109 
patients to think very carefully about
what<00:00:23.300> their<00:00:23.480> goals<00:00:23.720> are<00:00:24.220> but<00:00:25.220> there<00:00:25.520> are<00:00:25.550> more

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
what their goals are but there are more

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.880 
what their goals are but there are more
than<00:00:26.300> one<00:00:26.510> thing<00:00:26.810> there's<00:00:27.230> more<00:00:27.529> than<00:00:27.710> one<00:00:27.860> way

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
than one thing there's more than one way

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.820 
than one thing there's more than one way
to<00:00:28.100> do<00:00:28.640> something<00:00:29.180> and<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:30.020> may<00:00:30.170> be<00:00:30.230> a<00:00:30.350> standard

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
to do something and it may be a standard

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.380 
to do something and it may be a standard
of<00:00:30.949> care<00:00:31.130> treatment<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:31.789> something<00:00:32.210> else

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
of care treatment but something else

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.720 
of care treatment but something else
like<00:00:32.809> an<00:00:32.960> experimental<00:00:33.470> trial<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:34.640> think

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
like an experimental trial so I think

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.010 
like an experimental trial so I think
they<00:00:34.940> should<00:00:35.090> always<00:00:35.420> be<00:00:35.570> asking<00:00:35.750> that

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
they should always be asking that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.920 
they should always be asking that
question<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:37.430> there<00:00:37.730> not<00:00:37.940> an<00:00:38.120> alternative

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
question is there not an alternative

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.889 
question is there not an alternative
approach<00:00:39.790> what<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.329> alternative

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
approach what is that alternative

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.420 
approach what is that alternative
approach<00:00:42.170> how<00:00:42.380> do<00:00:42.440> I<00:00:42.530> get<00:00:42.620> information<00:00:43.250> about

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
approach how do I get information about

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.110 
approach how do I get information about
that<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.510> who<00:00:45.200> do<00:00:45.320> I<00:00:45.350> ask<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:46.130> what<00:00:46.850> does<00:00:47.000> it

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
that and who do I ask and what does it

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.870 
that and who do I ask and what does it
mean<00:00:47.300> if<00:00:47.450> I<00:00:47.570> make<00:00:47.809> that<00:00:47.840> choice<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:49.730> it's

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
mean if I make that choice and it's

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.180 
mean if I make that choice and it's
almost<00:00:50.059> always<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.840> context<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.469> clinical

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
almost always in the context of clinical

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.720 
almost always in the context of clinical
trials<00:00:52.790> what<00:00:53.450> next<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.290> available<00:00:54.890> what

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
trials what next is available what

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.819 
trials what next is available what
experimentally<00:00:56.210> is<00:00:56.600> being<00:00:56.870> done<00:00:57.110> what's<00:00:57.620> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
experimentally is being done what's the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.520 
experimentally is being done what's the
most<00:00:57.980> potentially<00:00:58.700> optimistic<00:00:59.480> new<00:01:00.140> form<00:01:00.410> of

most potentially optimistic new form of
therapy<00:01:01.329> patients<00:01:02.329> always<00:01:02.450> ask<00:01:02.750> me<00:01:02.930> what

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
therapy patients always ask me what

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.600 
therapy patients always ask me what
should<00:01:03.230> i<00:01:03.320> do<00:01:03.379> because<00:01:04.250> there<00:01:04.369> are<00:01:04.430> many

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
should i do because there are many

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.920 
should i do because there are many
choices<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:06.440> try<00:01:06.710> as<00:01:07.130> best<00:01:07.190> i<00:01:07.580> can<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.930> frame

choices and I try as best i can to frame

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.830 
choices and I try as best i can to frame
it<00:01:08.960> somewhat<00:01:09.470> back<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.920> them<00:01:10.100> what<00:01:11.030> risks<00:01:11.690> are

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
it somewhat back to them what risks are

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.050 
it somewhat back to them what risks are
you<00:01:11.960> willing<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.440> take<00:01:12.880> particularly<00:01:13.880> about

you willing to take particularly about

a remote community and they're

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.679 
a remote community and they're
interested<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.790> clinical<00:01:29.119> trial<00:01:29.390> that's

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
interested in a clinical trial that's

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.340 
interested in a clinical trial that's
500<00:01:30.259> miles<00:01:30.439> away<00:01:30.970> that's<00:01:31.970> going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.180> mean

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
500 miles away that's going to mean

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.480 
500 miles away that's going to mean
dislodging<00:01:33.350> themselves<00:01:33.799> from<00:01:33.920> their<00:01:34.100> support

group their family it's going to mean
travel<00:01:36.380> which<00:01:36.560> increases<00:01:37.040> fatigue<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.790> is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
travel which increases fatigue and is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.990 
travel which increases fatigue and is
that<00:01:38.990> reasonable<00:01:39.409> for<00:01:39.770> something<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.340> isn't

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
that reasonable for something that isn't

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.390 
that reasonable for something that isn't
proven<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.200> at<00:01:42.560> least<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.040> let<00:01:43.250> them

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
proven so I at least have to let them

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
proven so I at least have to let them
understand<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:45.460> sometimes<00:01:46.460> hope<00:01:47.210> and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
understand that sometimes hope and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.840 
understand that sometimes hope and
expectations<00:01:48.229> drive<00:01:48.860> people<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.490> do<00:01:49.610> things

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
expectations drive people to do things

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.609 
expectations drive people to do things
that<00:01:50.119> may<00:01:50.240> not<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.450> necessarily<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.470> their

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
that may not be necessarily in their

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.740 
that may not be necessarily in their
best<00:01:51.829> interests<00:01:52.579> but<00:01:53.060> at<00:01:53.180> least<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.450> keep<00:01:53.600> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
best interests but at least to keep that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.130 
best interests but at least to keep that
in<00:01:53.960> mind<00:01:54.610> but<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:55.640> do<00:01:56.000> suggest<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.930> them<00:01:57.079> that

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in mind but I do suggest to them that

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.030 
in mind but I do suggest to them that
they<00:01:57.320> strongly<00:01:57.920> talk<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.490> their<00:01:58.640> doctor<00:01:59.060> and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
they strongly talk to their doctor and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.069 
they strongly talk to their doctor and
clinicians<00:02:01.040> who<00:02:01.220> are<00:02:01.340> experts<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.509> they're

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
clinicians who are experts and they're

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.560
