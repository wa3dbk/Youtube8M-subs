 whose minerals 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.130
 they are the leisure system 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.980

 it is interest will continue to be alive in that we exist in what we are 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.859
 and understand what the meaning of our personal life has wants 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.920
 with collaborating to agree with serving that greater whole 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.439
 to that plot greater restlessness than existence and it is not that there was

 unwinds 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.950
 it is known as a good 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 is to connect with the same 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.159
 with the tails in deep intelligence cycle of that great entity 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.470
 invest in what we are 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.890
 and accept 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 we are one more within that great dignity 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.190
 and who specified surrendered 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.190
 to that great intelligence

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.970
 Yes Luis 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.479
 in the dynamics 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.109
 in the rhythms in the cycles of that great resistance 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.329
 it's always fine pointed to the entire killer where it will put 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.569
 of what the natural rhythm therefore adds for all of it adds the cnc to 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.859
 ourselves 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.689
 be ecological 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.249
 that is much more than being afraid of what might happen with the warming 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.239
 global 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.289
 global 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:33.089
 I visualize the bonds of love that bind us to all beings 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.240
 read i 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.739
 to thank 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.099
 honor life 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.449
 and then a client re-enchant everyday life 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.249
 in deep respect 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.589
 to all beings 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.479
 be ecological 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.389
 that one of it 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:51.649
 and feel 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:54.209
 that the air we breathe 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.209
 it comes from the trees and the jungles of the world 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.679
 here the food that every day takes more 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.949
 behind that food is the person 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.439
 I want to be clear why they will not grow and that they harvested 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:15.039
 wants that until that moment is the land that sheltered the sun that 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.049
 warmed the rain that bequeathed us 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.919
 and that is fine balance 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.329
 is what allows us 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.979
 exist and live 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.179
 st 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.359
 that everything is intertwined 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.419
 that everything affects everything 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.499
 that everything we do 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 touch all keko we create among all the world 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.439
 that not that I do to other sectors being all 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:40.859
 that he has water 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.809
 you are also looking for and doing others 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.029
 who adds the life 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.529
 it is a sacred pasture 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:49.819
 enke 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 every gesture every movement affects the whole 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.919
 psychological 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.399
 obviously it is to take care of the quality of the waters 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.179
 of the airs 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:04.629
 and of our planet 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.609
 But it is much more than that 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.029
 it is also to take care of personal status 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.239
 the personal debug state 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.089
 Purity intentona 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.979
 why 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.370
 the environment is psychological the psychic environment 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.120
 the critic 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.759
 the arrogance 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.819
 the fear 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.509
 the rancor 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.229
 are 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.999
 factors that pollute the environment contaminated deeply 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.419
 psychological work environments 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.970
 pollute our homes pollute cities never 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:44.360
 and therefore 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.029
 whose state efe 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:52.639
 the psychic environment of the world d that black cloud that many people are 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.610
 continuing the atmosphere 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.979
 of the place 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.199
 It's fundamental 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.199
 in a comprehensive police 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.319
 kind thoughts 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.360
 if we look, you have joyful creative types 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.089
 natural 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.089
 they generate a psychic environment 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.659
 luminous 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.659
 and that psychic environment giner luminous actions 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.800
 In sum it is about limits of love and the rest is given in addition
