00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 may not be so imposing but it is the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.849
 first step for children or adults 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.710
 who aspire to conquer the world with robots 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 he is the newest member of a long 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.809
 tradition of lego robotics kits 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.000
 like their ancestors event 3 is a 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.170
 small computer that controls motors 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 and sensors working in conjunction with 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.270
 lego technic pieces he is able to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.610
 take on the most varied forms but 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.780
 Physically assembling a robot is only half 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.640
 of fun 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 the rest is on schedule 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 that determines how it will react to your 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 environment 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 lego development software 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.229
 is still based on a visual language 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.420
 easy to learn but the interface was 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.540
 completely reformulated to become 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.460
 more organized and attractive than before 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.439
 robot controlled by a series of blocks 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 which can assume simple functions like 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.750
 activate the engine or perform operations 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.930
 complex systems such as those involving 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
 boolean and math in general 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.350
 depending on the project tipped chosen 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.110
 the difficulty barrier can be 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.540
 too high for beginners but not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
 programming guides are missing from the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 lake 's own site 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.299
 if the goal is just to create a program 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.939
 simple and fast this can also be 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.710
 done in the same see three and is not 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.689
 need to worry about the size of the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.850
 programs because the new robot has a slot 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.509
 sd card and much more memory 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.270
 internal 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.950
 after schedule and see 3 uses your 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 sensors to understand the world 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 back and react accordingly 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.049
 The kit includes three types 16 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.049
 infra-red 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.489
 a color sensor and a touch sensor 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.800
 comparing event 3 with the model 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.900
 previous or next 2.0 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.510
 it is clear that the new kit stands out 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.580
 by variety now two types of 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 motors and many parts in common 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.640
 including rectangular beams gears 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.620
 of varying wheel sizes and more 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.510
 the only problem is that the computer 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.280
 takes too long to call because 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.000
 It makes it difficult to program by 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.000
 trial and error 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.150
 anyway who does not know 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.980
 interested in programming can 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.380
 control a robot directly through the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.630
 remote control that is part of the kit 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.180
 Another alternative is 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.150
 using the Bluetooth application. 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.370
 smartphone with versions for android and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 oeci leads eating already comes configured 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.360
 for the official robots of the lego but 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.580
 you can also create your own 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.530
 control and sending commands for each 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.300
 motor 2 and 3 that 2,599 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.980
 real 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.110
 certainly not a low price but not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.580
 there is another robotic educational kit 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.580
 as complete as this 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.590
