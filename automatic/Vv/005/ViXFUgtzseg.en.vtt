to hear from you soon yeah for me that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
to hear from you soon yeah for me that
makes<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> most<00:00:34.680> sense<00:00:34.800> you're<00:00:35.280> always<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
makes the most sense you're always the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.250 
makes the most sense you're always the
hands<00:00:36.000> always<00:00:36.210> operating<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.050> most

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
hands always operating is the most

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
hands always operating is the most
relaxed<00:00:37.680> position<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> me<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
relaxed position and that to me is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.460 
relaxed position and that to me is
probably<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> biggest<00:00:40.020> selling

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
probably one of the biggest selling

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.240 
probably one of the biggest selling
points<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.980> me<00:00:41.750> because<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.409> play<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.920> as

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
points for me because that to play in as

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.939 
points for me because that to play in as
relaxed<00:00:44.970> position<00:00:45.089> as<00:00:45.449> possible<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> always

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
relaxed position as possible is always

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.170 
relaxed position as possible is always
going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.159> be<00:00:47.190> good<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.000> no

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to be good for you there's no

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.829 
going to be good for you there's no
downside<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.720> that<00:00:49.100> yeah<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.580> know<00:00:50.729> it<00:00:51.510> seems

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
downside to that yeah you know it seems

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.590 
downside to that yeah you know it seems
very<00:00:52.050> seems<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.979> this<00:00:53.159> sorry<00:00:53.820> simplest<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
very seems like this sorry simplest is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.160 
very seems like this sorry simplest is
simplest<00:00:55.379> method<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:55.890> well<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.670> thought<00:00:56.970> I

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
simplest method as well as I thought I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.310 
simplest method as well as I thought I
straight<00:00:58.170> forward<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.769> know<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.190> no<00:00:59.960> no<00:01:00.960> it's

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
straight forward you know but no no it's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.960 
straight forward you know but no no it's
very<00:01:01.409> effective<00:01:01.860> also<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.820> all

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
very effective also it's good for all

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.299 
very effective also it's good for all
different<00:01:03.150> kinds<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.659> bases<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.979> don't<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
different kinds of bases you don't have

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
different kinds of bases you don't have
to<00:01:05.400> change<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.090> go<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.420> four<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> five<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
to change if you go from four to five to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
to change if you go from four to five to
six<00:01:07.380> string<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.860> same<00:01:08.070> thing<00:01:08.340> operates<00:01:08.760> or

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
six string the same thing operates or

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
six string the same thing operates or
the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.570> technique<00:01:09.960> operates<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> exactly

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the same technique operates and exactly

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.820 
the same technique operates and exactly
the<00:01:10.950> same<00:01:11.190> way<00:01:11.340> good<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.840> when<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the same way good so that when I say you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
the same way good so that when I say you
know<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.250> function<00:01:14.610> formula<00:01:15.030> 1<00:01:15.299> 2<00:01:15.450> 3<00:01:15.479> 4<00:01:15.810> 5<00:01:15.990> 6

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
know the no function formula 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.889 
know the no function formula 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:01:16.350> 1<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.700> say<00:01:18.030> locate<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.630> just

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
7 1 you know if I just say locate I just

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.450 
7 1 you know if I just say locate I just
pick<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.079> note<00:01:19.289> and<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.500> okay<00:01:19.710> well<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
pick a note and say okay well this is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.319 
pick a note and say okay well this is
this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.560> right<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
this is for all right I know I know if I

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.950 
this is for all right I know I know if I
know<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.070> figure<00:01:26.850> out

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
know that's for then I can figure out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.120 
know that's for then I can figure out
every<00:01:27.960> other<00:01:28.079> note<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> major<00:01:28.649> scale<00:01:28.979> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
every other note of the major scale on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
every other note of the major scale on
the<00:01:29.340> bass<00:01:29.430> fingerboard<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.240> knowing<00:01:30.479> that's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the bass fingerboard just knowing that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
the bass fingerboard just knowing that's
for<00:01:30.899> using<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.530> formula<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.670> well

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
for using that formula because well

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
for using that formula because well
that's<00:01:33.030> four<00:01:33.390> threes<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.289> here

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that's four threes got to be here

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.779 
that's four threes got to be here
because<00:01:34.649> three<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.070> always<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.399> half<00:01:35.579> step

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
because three is always a half step

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:36.940 
because three is always a half step
below<00:01:35.939> for

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
below for

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.179 
below for
right<00:01:37.759> right<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.990> then<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:39.439> fives<00:01:39.950> got

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
right right and then and then fives got

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.429 
right right and then and then fives got
to<00:01:40.280> be<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.369> whole<00:01:40.520> step<00:01:40.700> up<00:01:40.880> yeah<00:01:41.780> well<00:01:42.049> five<00:01:42.289> is

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
to be a whole step up yeah well five is

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.569 
to be a whole step up yeah well five is
there<00:01:42.590> then<00:01:42.799> six<00:01:43.039> has<00:01:43.159> got<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.369> be<00:01:43.399> a<00:01:43.460> whole

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
there then six has got to be a whole

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.940 
there then six has got to be a whole
step<00:01:43.759> up<00:01:43.909> from<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.180> wealth<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:45.350> six<00:01:45.710> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
step up from that wealth that's six and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.060 
step up from that wealth that's six and
seven<00:01:46.159> has<00:01:46.250> got<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.429> be<00:01:46.460> here<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.299> you<00:01:47.360> know

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
seven has got to be here so you know

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.279 
seven has got to be here so you know
that's<00:01:49.070> not<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.640> use<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.119> distances<00:01:50.689> you

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's not you use the distances you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.840 
that's not you use the distances you
know<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.829> numbers<00:01:52.189> representing<00:01:52.759> the
