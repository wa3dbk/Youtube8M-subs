suppose<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.910> reason<00:00:25.060> we<00:00:25.269> went<00:00:25.420> organic<00:00:25.630> was

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
suppose the reason we went organic was

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.290

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
simply the class was a problem and we

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.610 
simply the class was a problem and we
said<00:00:58.120> organic<00:00:58.539> fabrics<00:00:58.930> video<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.410> little<00:00:59.500> bit

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
said organic fabrics video a little bit

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.130 
said organic fabrics video a little bit
in<00:00:59.890> car<00:01:00.100> saving<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.699> weren't<00:01:01.140> buying

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
and very little inputs when I suppose

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.230 
and very little inputs when I suppose
our<00:01:07.720> three<00:01:08.619> main<00:01:08.770> products<00:01:09.100> are<00:01:09.250> eggs<00:01:09.580> chicken

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
our three main products are eggs chicken

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.779 
our three main products are eggs chicken
and<00:01:10.690> beef<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.350> supposed<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.369> main<00:01:12.520> difference

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
and beef I supposed to main difference

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.339 
and beef I supposed to main difference
between<00:01:13.060> organics<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:13.690> auto<00:01:14.020> type<00:01:14.229> of

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:14.349 
between organics and auto type of

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.990 
between organics and auto type of
farming<00:01:14.649> is<00:01:14.800> you're<00:01:15.069> not<00:01:15.220> putting<00:01:15.819> any

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
farming is you're not putting any

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.910 
farming is you're not putting any
chemicals<00:01:16.500> fertilizer<00:01:17.500> chemical

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
chemicals fertilizer chemical

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.219 
chemicals fertilizer chemical
fertilizers<00:01:18.340> on<00:01:18.429> your<00:01:18.580> grass<00:01:18.759> or<00:01:19.229> chemical

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
fertilizers on your grass or chemical

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.279 
fertilizers on your grass or chemical
spray<00:01:20.440> is<00:01:20.619> for<00:01:21.310> your<00:01:21.459> grain<00:01:21.789> crops<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.140> you

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
spray is for your grain crops so you

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.550 
spray is for your grain crops so you
basically<00:01:23.679> have<00:01:23.890> no<00:01:24.099> body<00:01:25.030> inputs<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:26.319> just

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
basically have no body inputs you just

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.080 
basically have no body inputs you just
use<00:01:26.649> your<00:01:26.800> own<00:01:26.890> family<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.369> manure<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.310> your

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
use your own family of manure so your

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.260 
use your own family of manure so your
product<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.660> suppose<00:01:32.399> it's<00:01:33.399> very<00:01:33.459> natural<00:01:33.759> it

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
product I suppose it's very natural it

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.669 
product I suppose it's very natural it
is<00:01:34.300> put<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.780> way<00:01:34.869> it's<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:35.530> people

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
is put in a way it's like what people

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:36.960 
is put in a way it's like what people
would<00:01:35.890> have<00:01:35.979> had<00:01:36.099> in<00:01:36.160> this<00:01:36.220> country<00:01:36.399> 50<00:01:36.789> years

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
would have had in this country 50 years

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.740 
would have had in this country 50 years
ago<00:01:37.030> it's<00:01:38.020> an<00:01:38.110> old-fashioned<00:01:38.560> product<00:01:39.750> okay

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
ago it's an old-fashioned product okay

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.240 
ago it's an old-fashioned product okay
chicken<00:01:41.050> no<00:01:41.140> would<00:01:41.289> be<00:01:41.380> expensive<00:01:41.920> what<00:01:42.099> it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
chicken no would be expensive what it's

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.010 
chicken no would be expensive what it's
still<00:01:42.819> only<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.060> same<00:01:43.209> prices<00:01:43.450> we<00:01:43.750> see<00:01:43.899> up

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
still only the same prices we see up

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.960 
still only the same prices we see up
here<00:01:44.080> for<00:01:44.380> beef<00:01:44.590> roast<00:01:44.860> around<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.459> 15<00:01:45.819> euro

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
here for beef roast around the 15 euro

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.749 
here for beef roast around the 15 euro
so<00:01:46.679> it's<00:01:47.679> a<00:01:47.770> big<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.009> chicken<00:01:48.280> as<00:01:48.459> well<00:01:48.489> and
