 doing here in hell I know too 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.019
 that it is not very common to play in hell 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.140
 more often in the center but there 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.829
 There are people playing hell, so it's 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.579

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.950
 library everyone who loves their part 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.400
 groups two names is that side here is 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:02.510
 unip is the left side here is onip 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.270
 I also do not know why the name of xuxa 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.100
 more so it's called then and if that part 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.440
 that the kick to ellaone b is here is means 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.760
 all this part that is from the middle 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.860
 day 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.920
 this corridor is that the entire screen in the 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.020
 front and even winning here has a 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.130
 wrong way in this part that is the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.220
 wrong way is out of the way here 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:36.260
 Wrong, we got this whole aisle. 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 Here it is called or false all his 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.810
 part that the false means 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:47.330
 That 's where we take the right entrance. 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.610
 x from that part you entered 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.600
 in the apartment or carpet like you 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 to prefer 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.060
 here is here a very call of 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.060
 apartment and many call it's carpet 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 I'm particularly not well here is the 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:09.050
 Quartinho very obvious do not lose is the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:14.150
 edict breaking is here is the apartment 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.340
 all of you is that you okay now 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.060
 people getting on a rug here we 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.430
 come in here in this little double and I do not know 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.180
 which does not have a good shrimp fish name 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.320
 but I call it so it does not have a name 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.730
 specific 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.910
 well here all your part that is the rug is 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 I'm not sorry , that's the part that 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.019
 and it's the arena 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 Good, I guess that's what I had. 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.790
 not lacking a part of the emotion 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.430
 Good, she forgot to talk about it from here. 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.609
 leaving from above is the cemetery too 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.049
 I do not know why the name but I believe 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:04.790
 that is because it implies that dies is not 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:08.900
 only one is a kick practically there to bomb 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.849
 the khaki and a graveyard 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.750
 Good, people. This video will stay in 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.430

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.430
