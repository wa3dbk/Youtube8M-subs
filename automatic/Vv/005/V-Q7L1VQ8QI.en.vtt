00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
lot harder but that was a big moment

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
moment and the thing with a lot of the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.690 
moment and the thing with a lot of the
teams<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.020> they're<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.619> riders<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.189> asking

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
teams now they're the riders are asking

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
teams now they're the riders are asking
to<00:01:20.909> turn<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> traction<00:01:21.900> control<00:01:22.520> down<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to turn the traction control down or to

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.360 
to turn the traction control down or to
make<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.689> less<00:01:24.840> effective<00:01:25.520> basically<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
make it less effective basically and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.150 
make it less effective basically and
as<00:01:27.820> we<00:01:28.060> saw<00:01:28.240> with<00:01:28.540> kian<00:01:29.380> re<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:29.830> saw<00:01:29.980> him

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
as we saw with kian re we saw him

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.580 
as we saw with kian re we saw him
spinning<00:01:30.490> up<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.910> also<00:01:31.630> Carl<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.260> know<00:01:32.380> they

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
spinning up and also Carl you know they

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.810 
spinning up and also Carl you know they
that's<00:01:32.920> probably<00:01:33.220> what<00:01:33.370> they're<00:01:33.490> doing<00:01:33.730> and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
that's probably what they're doing and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.090 
that's probably what they're doing and
now<00:01:33.970> it's<00:01:34.120> becoming<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.570> fine<00:01:34.840> line<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.320> what's

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
now it's becoming a fine line of what's

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.910 
now it's becoming a fine line of what's
right<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.430> what's<00:01:36.790> not<00:01:36.940> right<00:01:37.590> well<00:01:38.590> car

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
right and what's not right well car

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.470 
right and what's not right well car
let's<00:01:39.160> just<00:01:39.400> see<00:01:39.520> if<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.730> can<00:01:39.910> gain<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.420> back

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
let's just see if you can gain that back

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.440 
let's just see if you can gain that back
in<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.380> middle<00:01:41.860> part<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> lap<00:01:42.730> he<00:01:43.060> didn't

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
in the middle part of the lap he didn't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.990 
in the middle part of the lap he didn't
lose<00:01:43.660> that<00:01:43.690> much<00:01:44.310> thinking<00:01:45.310> about<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.760> point

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
lose that much thinking about it point

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.330 
lose that much thinking about it point
18<00:01:46.300> nearly<00:01:46.780> point2<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.380> second<00:01:47.800> from<00:01:48.190> that

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
18 nearly point2 of a second from that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.160 
18 nearly point2 of a second from that
big<00:01:48.610> moment<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.120> was<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.360> big<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.780> let's<00:01:49.930> see<00:01:50.110> if

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
big moment it was a big one let's see if

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
you can catch it back through the second

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.280 
you can catch it back through the second
split<00:01:53.490> far<00:01:54.490> that's<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.910> fast<00:01:55.330> corner<00:01:55.810> downhill

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
split far that's a fast corner downhill

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.480 
split far that's a fast corner downhill
there<00:01:56.850> fantastic<00:01:57.850> there<00:01:58.090> Oh<00:01:58.500> still<00:01:59.500> up<00:01:59.650> he<00:02:00.250> is

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
there fantastic there Oh still up he is

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.790 
there fantastic there Oh still up he is
up<00:02:00.730> that's<00:02:01.390> point<00:02:01.660> 3<00:02:01.870> of<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.050> second<00:02:02.440> his<00:02:02.530> game

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
up that's point 3 of a second his game

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.530 
up that's point 3 of a second his game
through<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.130> middle<00:02:03.340> part<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.730> track<00:02:03.970> and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
through the middle part of the track and

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.050 
through the middle part of the track and
writes<00:02:04.990> up<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.650> rumble<00:02:06.010> strip<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.910> does

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
writes up on the rumble strip that does

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.550 
writes up on the rumble strip that does
that<00:02:07.270> give<00:02:07.450> him<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.660> better<00:02:07.840> entry<00:02:08.260> into<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
that give him a better entry into the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.270 
that give him a better entry into the
final<00:02:08.980> corner<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.550> think<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.390> might<00:02:10.600> have<00:02:10.720> done

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
final corner I think it might have done

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.720 
final corner I think it might have done
squeezing<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.450> come<00:02:13.930> across<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.440> line

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
squeezing it on to come across the line

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.190 
squeezing it on to come across the line
he's<00:02:15.730> kept<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.360> yes<00:02:17.020> my<00:02:17.380> boys<00:02:18.160> 3<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> times

he's kept it yes my boys 3 but the times
are<00:02:20.440> very<00:02:20.470> tight<00:02:20.980> here<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.670> far<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:24.400> cars

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
are very tight here so far I think cars

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.700 
are very tight here so far I think cars
actually<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.780> thing<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:26.620> this

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
actually that the thing with this

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.010 
actually that the thing with this
circuit<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.940> said<00:02:28.000> its<00:02:28.240> technical<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
circuit is as I said its technical so

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.840 
circuit is as I said its technical so
the<00:02:29.140> rider<00:02:29.380> has<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.650> really<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.490> know<00:02:30.520> ride
