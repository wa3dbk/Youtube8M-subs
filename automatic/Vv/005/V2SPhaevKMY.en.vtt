and so on this is very cool you've got

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.170 
and so on this is very cool you've got
improved<00:02:47.560> speed<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.070> piloting<00:02:48.550> so<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
improved speed of piloting so if you

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.790 
improved speed of piloting so if you
want<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.390> dish<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.660> 40k<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.440> have<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> legacy

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
want to dish out 40k and have a legacy

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.790 
want to dish out 40k and have a legacy
level<00:02:51.220> of<00:02:51.370> five<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:53.500> get<00:02:53.650> your

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
level of five you can then get your

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.580 
level of five you can then get your
speed<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.340> piloting<00:02:54.820> level<00:02:55.330> one<00:02:55.540> at<00:02:55.780> level<00:02:56.350> ten

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
speed of piloting level one at level ten

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.300 
speed of piloting level one at level ten
you<00:02:57.580> can<00:02:57.730> also<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.300> spend<00:02:58.720> 175<00:02:59.590> k<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> get

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
you can also then spend 175 k and get

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.030 
you can also then spend 175 k and get
speeder<00:03:00.880> piloting<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.960> level<00:03:02.290> 30<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
speeder piloting to at level 30 and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.700 
speeder piloting to at level 30 and
speed<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> piloting<00:03:04.630> level<00:03:05.020> 3<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.740> 44<00:03:06.610> 250k

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
speed of piloting level 3 at 44 250k

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.350 
speed of piloting level 3 at 44 250k
that<00:03:08.710> also<00:03:09.160> requires<00:03:09.390> legacy<00:03:10.390> 5<00:03:12.060> next<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.239> we

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
that also requires legacy 5 next up we

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.330 
that also requires legacy 5 next up we
have<00:03:13.390> all<00:03:13.720> your<00:03:13.840> companion<00:03:14.350> stuff<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.100> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
have all your companion stuff so you can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.190 
have all your companion stuff so you can
increase<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.730> amount<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.390> affection<00:03:16.989> game

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
increase the amount of affection game

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.500 
increase the amount of affection game
from<00:03:17.410> giving<00:03:17.739> gifts<00:03:18.220> by<00:03:18.459> five<00:03:18.940> percent<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
from giving gifts by five percent and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.320 
from giving gifts by five percent and
that<00:03:19.720> goes<00:03:19.989> right<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:20.709> through<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.730> it

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
that goes right up through and it

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.870 
that goes right up through and it
increases<00:03:22.810> five<00:03:23.230> percent<00:03:23.590> each<00:03:23.770> time<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
increases five percent each time the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.670 
increases five percent each time the
only<00:03:25.090> thing<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.360> changes<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.170> legacy

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
only thing that changes is the legacy

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.010 
only thing that changes is the legacy
level<00:03:27.100> requirement<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.030> price<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.570> do<00:03:28.750> so

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
level requirement and the price to do so

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.310 
level requirement and the price to do so
and<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:31.060> you've<00:03:31.300> got<00:03:31.540> increase<00:03:32.080> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
and then you've got increase the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.229 
and then you've got increase the
affection<00:03:32.920> gain<00:03:33.160> from<00:03:33.370> conversations<00:03:33.880> by

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
affection gain from conversations by

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.660 
affection gain from conversations by
five<00:03:34.540> percent<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.920> goes<00:03:36.130> all<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.459> way

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
five percent and that goes all the way

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.490 
five percent and that goes all the way
up<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.300> get<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> total<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.900> fifteen<00:03:38.200> percent

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
up so you get a total of fifteen percent

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.100 
up so you get a total of fifteen percent
if<00:03:38.739> you<00:03:38.980> want<00:03:39.280> you've<00:03:40.269> also<00:03:40.450> got<00:03:40.720> legacy

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
if you want you've also got legacy

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.530 
if you want you've also got legacy
crafting<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.160> this<00:03:42.370> increases<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:42.910> chance<00:03:43.330> of

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
crafting so this increases the chance of

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.960 
crafting so this increases the chance of
an<00:03:43.720> augment<00:03:44.200> slots<00:03:44.560> by<00:03:44.860> one<00:03:45.070> percent<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.730> you

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
an augment slots by one percent and you

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.670 
an augment slots by one percent and you
can<00:03:46.090> get<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.300> all<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> way<00:03:46.810> up<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.050> three

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
can get that all the way up to three

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.520 
can get that all the way up to three
percent<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.910> fairly<00:03:49.360> pricey<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.110> not

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
percent that's fairly pricey and not

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.160 
percent that's fairly pricey and not
much<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.220> percentage<00:03:51.519> increase<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.720> don't

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
much of a percentage increase so I don't

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.470 
much of a percentage increase so I don't
think<00:03:53.620> many<00:03:53.830> people<00:03:53.920> are<00:03:54.250> going<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.700> spec<00:03:55.060> into

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
think many people are going to spec into

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.920 
think many people are going to spec into
that<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.880> very<00:03:58.090> cool<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.750> if<00:03:58.840> you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
that and this is very cool so if you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.270 
that and this is very cool so if you
