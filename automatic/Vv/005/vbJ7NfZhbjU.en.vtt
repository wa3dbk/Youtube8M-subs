little<00:00:53.600> bit<00:00:53.750> about<00:00:53.840> glassing<00:00:54.560> techniques<00:00:54.980> and

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
little bit about glassing techniques and

like that
and<00:01:27.440> then<00:01:28.040> work<00:01:28.280> my<00:01:28.310> way<00:01:28.490> out<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.660> many<00:01:29.750> times

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
and then work my way out so many times

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.109 
and then work my way out so many times
I've<00:01:30.380> sat<00:01:30.560> down<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.770> spot<00:01:31.100> like<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.970> I'm

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
I've sat down a spot like this and I'm

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.090 
I've sat down a spot like this and I'm
glass<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.810> clear<00:01:33.020> across<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.500> valley<00:01:33.680> there

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
glass and clear across the valley there

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.920 
glass and clear across the valley there
at<00:01:34.670> those<00:01:34.880> Aspen's<00:01:35.330> and<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:35.600> sudden

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
at those Aspen's and all sudden

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.670 
at those Aspen's and all sudden
thump-thump-thump

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
thump-thump-thump

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.980 
thump-thump-thump
a<00:01:36.770> buck<00:01:37.009> gets<00:01:37.399> up<00:01:37.550> right<00:01:37.759> below<00:01:37.940> me<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.780> if<00:01:38.899> I

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
a buck gets up right below me and if I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.990 
a buck gets up right below me and if I
would<00:01:39.140> have<00:01:39.229> spotted<00:01:39.440> him<00:01:39.800> first<00:01:40.490> before<00:01:40.790> he

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
would have spotted him first before he

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.820 
would have spotted him first before he
got<00:01:41.149> up<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.570> would<00:01:41.869> have<00:01:41.899> had<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> chance<00:01:42.410> at<00:01:42.680> him

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
got up I would have had a chance at him

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.889 
got up I would have had a chance at him
so<00:01:43.040> that's<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:43.820> one<00:01:44.090> tip<00:01:44.330> when<00:01:44.509> your<00:01:44.660> glass

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
so that's just one tip when your glass

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.930 
so that's just one tip when your glass
and<00:01:45.170> out<00:01:45.290> west<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:45.890> big<00:01:46.130> open<00:01:46.310> country

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and out west in this big open country

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.420 
and out west in this big open country
don't<00:01:47.720> underestimate<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.890> stuff<00:01:49.160> right

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
don't underestimate the stuff right

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.490 
don't underestimate the stuff right
under<00:01:49.759> your<00:01:49.850> nose<00:01:50.119> you<00:01:50.630> want<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.899> sit<00:01:51.050> down<00:01:51.229> and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
under your nose you want to sit down and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.410 
under your nose you want to sit down and
glass<00:01:52.040> this<00:01:52.250> stuff<00:01:52.520> right<00:01:52.759> underneath<00:01:53.240> you

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
glass this stuff right underneath you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.810 
glass this stuff right underneath you
and<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.290> stuff<00:01:54.650> then<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.370> next<00:01:55.640> ridge

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
and then that stuff then the next ridge

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.640 
and then that stuff then the next ridge
and<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.360> next<00:01:56.630> ridge<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.020> work<00:01:57.170> your<00:01:57.320> way<00:01:57.440> out

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
and the next ridge and work your way out

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.460 
and the next ridge and work your way out
glassing<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.700> grain<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.180> terrain

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
glassing with the grain of the terrain

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.170 
glassing with the grain of the terrain
it'll<00:02:00.470> just<00:02:00.590> be<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.770> lot<00:02:01.520> more<00:02:01.729> efficient

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
it'll just be a lot more efficient

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.580 
it'll just be a lot more efficient
hunter<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.600> way<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:02.840> just<00:02:03.229> remember<00:02:03.440> that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
hunter that way so just remember that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.560 
hunter that way so just remember that
next<00:02:03.890> time<00:02:04.040> you're<00:02:04.159> out<00:02:04.280> hunting<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.909> getting

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
next time you're out hunting and getting

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.000 
next time you're out hunting and getting
a<00:02:05.630> good<00:02:05.780> vantage<00:02:05.990> spot<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:06.770> just

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
a good vantage spot like this and just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.740 
a good vantage spot like this and just
spend<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.490> whole<00:02:07.520> evening<00:02:07.670> Glasson

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
spend the whole evening Glasson

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.860 
spend the whole evening Glasson
