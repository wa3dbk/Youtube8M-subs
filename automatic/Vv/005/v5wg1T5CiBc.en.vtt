00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 as a picture is worth more than a thousand 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 words today come world drone let's go to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.680
 take a look at how good one flies 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.660
 of the drones that we liked the most in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.190
 the channel that is the gap x 50 by the way 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 my name is rafael cruz welcome to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.089
 world drone today we have moved 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 here good a little to where the land of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.289
 nobody for we can take a look for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.789
 to have a look at one of the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550
 most interesting drones in the market 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.050
 that nothing we are going to get ready to prepare 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.119
 here some of the little things we are going to see 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 let's put the batteries have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 brought here our good our 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 repertoire of batteries we do not have 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.260
 the more we have now we are going to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.640
 try then let's record also 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.190
 other drones that's why we have another type 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 we are going to take the battery that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 is the good thing that is the official battery the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.070
 of 500 milliamps we are going to connect 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.110
 nothing 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.230
 it is very important that you always have 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.450
 the batteries good before you go to fly 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.620
 have them in a separate place well 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.970
 sheltered 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.700
 because well you know that there may be 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.190
 problems we light the command is worth very 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.980
 important first turn on the remote and 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.019
 then turn on the drone so that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 that's good so you can synchronize 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.320
 with him and there is no problem 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 we turn on the command we turn on the drone 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.450
 we are going to put it well we are going to put it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.979
 here we are going to fly it over there so 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.270
 nothing because we have the only one against is 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.890
 very important and we give nothing to 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.380
 up here in a jiffy in command 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 let's go up and down what 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.009
 we have incro niza 2 shortly already 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.399
 we have then we are going to talk 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.399
 a little 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.870
 good guys let's get closer 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.060
 Soon we are going to approach a second 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.310
 because now good as he had been 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.440
 watching we have been recording in two 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.629
 different flight modes the mode 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.360
 flight flight mode h now let's 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.459
 fly it in h mode h mode is the most 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 fast the fastest so we're going to 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.090
 put it here in this straight line looking 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.890
 there 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.930
 ok let's put it looking over there 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.960
 good to me the camera to more detail 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.830
 in a little good 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.690
 let's fly the drone asia let's fly 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.850
 the drone towards there 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.459
 I'll bring the micro I think 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.290
 my voice is going a little bit we are going to 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.420
 fly the drone towards there and in the mode 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.310
 first with the mode we are going to fly it the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.380
 drone first do with the module like this 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.530
 let's have a look, let's go 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.530
 watch 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.570
 uy sorry forgiveness 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 in hy mode let's do it first in 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.680
 mode 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.030
 perfect the model is the one that we have 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.310
 here for example here in it 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.590
 we can see that there is one in this mode is 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.650
 the slowest is worth so let's go 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.170
 over there and let's see how many and we're going 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.250
 to see how much speed 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.050
 we also see that it is a speed 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.460
 quite 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.500
 pretty fast as you are seeing 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.860
 I do not know if you can see the drone right from 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.860
 the camera 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.240
 the problem in this way 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.280
 is that our reaction speed is 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.350
 quite slow as you are able to see 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.230
 so now let's put the mode 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.290
 faster than ejecting good if you can 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.880
 watch the video of the cob command and see what it is 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.500
 the quick mode that in mode so 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.230
 let's go now we want to 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.040
 As you can see, it leans a lot and 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.900
 well that 's enough already 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.510
 seeing the reaction rate is 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.010
 pretty amazing incredible truth a 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.160
 drone you are seeing that it is very 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.220
 versatile let's land we were going to 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.350
 go acting 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.150
 Well, you guys, you see, it's a drone 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.950
 really versatile here you are watching me 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.360
 with the micro so nothing I hope that you 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.890
 you liked the video sula and you like it and 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.700
 see you a new video here in the world 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.700
