00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that because I this is the mid-range

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.660 
that because I this is the mid-range
monitor<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.969> gimme<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:48.230> if<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.670> HD

with DVI VGA or I think hdmi yes hdmi
port<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> might<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
port is there so this is might be the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.450 
port is there so this is might be the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
smaller size and smaller price if you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.020 
smaller size and smaller price if you

response rate I don't know what

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.610 
response rate I don't know what
difference<00:03:52.800> is<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.100> does<00:03:53.520> but<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.350> think<00:03:55.350> a

difference is it does but I think a
little<00:03:56.100> bit<00:03:56.490> difference<00:03:57.300> with<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.350> can

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
little bit difference with that so I can

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.120 
little bit difference with that so I can
