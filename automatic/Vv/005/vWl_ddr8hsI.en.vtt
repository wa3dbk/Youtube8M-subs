00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
misconception that is often widely

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.279 
misconception that is often widely
propagated<00:00:17.950> out<00:00:18.100> there<00:00:18.310> by<00:00:18.490> low-carb

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
propagated out there by low-carb

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710 
propagated out there by low-carb
detractors<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:20.560> it's<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.550> confusion<00:00:22.359> over

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
detractors and it's the confusion over

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.470 
detractors and it's the confusion over
the<00:00:22.750> terms<00:00:23.109> ketosis<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.689> ketoacidosis<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the terms ketosis and ketoacidosis and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.749 
the terms ketosis and ketoacidosis and
you<00:00:28.480> just<00:00:29.349> got<00:00:29.560> asked<00:00:29.890> this<00:00:29.920> question<00:00:30.369> by<00:00:30.519> one

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
you just got asked this question by one

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.890 
you just got asked this question by one
of<00:00:30.880> my<00:00:31.500> watchers<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.619> my<00:00:32.710> videos<00:00:33.070> that<00:00:33.730> she<00:00:34.720> had

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
of my watchers of my videos that she had

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.260 
of my watchers of my videos that she had
started<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.410> Atkins<00:00:35.800> diet<00:00:35.860> and<00:00:36.310> one<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.149> her

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
started the Atkins diet and one of her

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.299 
started the Atkins diet and one of her
his<00:00:37.390> friends<00:00:37.930> had<00:00:38.079> said<00:00:38.379> you<00:00:38.860> know<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.070> get

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
his friends had said you know you get

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.639 
his friends had said you know you get
too<00:00:39.460> much<00:00:39.610> ketones<00:00:40.120> in<00:00:40.270> your<00:00:40.450> blood<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:40.840> you

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
too much ketones in your blood and you

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.979 
too much ketones in your blood and you
go<00:00:41.860> into<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.129> coma<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.730> then<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.149> die<00:00:43.360> and

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
go into a coma and then you die and

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.080 
go into a coma and then you die and
again<00:00:44.860> what<00:00:45.160> would<00:00:45.340> does<00:00:45.550> this<00:00:45.670> all<00:00:45.820> come<00:00:45.850> down

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
again what would does this all come down

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.750 
again what would does this all come down
to<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.719> this<00:00:47.110> confusional<00:00:47.800> room<00:00:48.039> between<00:00:48.520> the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
to is this confusional room between the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.760 
to is this confusional room between the
difference<00:00:49.329> between<00:00:49.420> ketosis<00:00:50.020> which<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.739> a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
difference between ketosis which is a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.340 
difference between ketosis which is a
process<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.609> burning<00:00:51.760> fat<00:00:52.059> for<00:00:52.300> fuel<00:00:52.449> also

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
process of burning fat for fuel also

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
process of burning fat for fuel also
called<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.649> policies<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:56.010> ketoacidosis

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
called the policies and ketoacidosis

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.689 
called the policies and ketoacidosis
which<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:59.160> disease<00:01:00.160> or<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.489> medical

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
which is a disease or a medical

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.669 
which is a disease or a medical
condition<00:01:01.059> that<00:01:01.359> only<00:01:01.690> affects<00:01:01.930> type<00:01:02.410> 1

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
condition that only affects type 1

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.610 
condition that only affects type 1
diabetes<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.460> again<00:01:04.239> let's<00:01:04.600> understand<00:01:05.290> what

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
diabetes and again let's understand what

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.820 
diabetes and again let's understand what
the<00:01:05.770> two<00:01:05.920> terms<00:01:06.190> are<00:01:06.430> ketosis<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.380> process

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
the two terms are ketosis is the process

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
the two terms are ketosis is the process
of<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.400> body<00:01:09.610> burning<00:01:10.200> ketones<00:01:11.200> for<00:01:11.740> fuel<00:01:12.070> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
of the body burning ketones for fuel and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.600 
of the body burning ketones for fuel and
releasing<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.080> because<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:15.009> body<00:01:15.250> cannot

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
releasing and because the body cannot

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.240 
releasing and because the body cannot
consume<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.689> entire<00:01:16.720> fatty<00:01:17.350> acids<00:01:17.799> for<00:01:18.070> fuel

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
consume the entire fatty acids for fuel

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.550 
consume the entire fatty acids for fuel
it<00:01:18.759> has<00:01:19.000> these<00:01:19.240> byproducts<00:01:19.780> called<00:01:20.170> ketones

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
it has these byproducts called ketones

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.230 
it has these byproducts called ketones
and<00:01:20.829> they<00:01:20.979> float<00:01:21.250> throughout<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.670> body<00:01:21.850> for

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
and they float throughout the body for

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.749 
and they float throughout the body for
and<00:01:22.479> get<00:01:23.229> its<00:01:23.380> treated<00:01:23.770> through<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.549> urine

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
and get its treated through the urine

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.819 
and get its treated through the urine
and<00:01:25.000> that's<00:01:25.630> how<00:01:25.750> you're<00:01:26.049> able<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.380> test<00:01:26.619> for

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
and that's how you're able to test for

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.780 
and that's how you're able to test for
them<00:01:28.170> using<00:01:29.170> ketone<00:01:29.530> strips<00:01:29.790> ketoacidosis

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
them using ketone strips ketoacidosis

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.170 
them using ketone strips ketoacidosis
like<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.869> said<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.820> specific<00:01:33.820> medical

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
like I said is a specific medical

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.060 
like I said is a specific medical
condition<00:01:34.689> that<00:01:34.720> only<00:01:35.049> affects<00:01:35.350> type<00:01:35.829> 1

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
condition that only affects type 1

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.210 
condition that only affects type 1
diabetes<00:01:36.520> who<00:01:37.270> when<00:01:38.079> they're<00:01:38.259> hyperglycemic

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
diabetes who when they're hyperglycemic

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.950 
diabetes who when they're hyperglycemic
which<00:01:39.700> means<00:01:40.000> when<00:01:40.240> they're<00:01:40.420> very<00:01:40.450> high<00:01:40.930> in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
which means when they're very high in

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.260 
which means when they're very high in
there<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.409> blood<00:01:41.680> sugar<00:01:42.040> levels<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.670> their

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
there is blood sugar levels and their

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.210 
there is blood sugar levels and their
bodies<00:01:43.450> cannot<00:01:43.960> produce<00:01:44.200> enough<00:01:44.649> insulin<00:01:44.860> or

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
bodies cannot produce enough insulin or

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.810 
bodies cannot produce enough insulin or
any<00:01:46.180> insulin<00:01:46.780> their<00:01:47.590> body<00:01:47.829> starts<00:01:48.430> producing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
any insulin their body starts producing

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.840 
any insulin their body starts producing
instead<00:01:49.540> of<00:01:49.689> using<00:01:50.140> all<00:01:50.469> that<00:01:50.710> sugar<00:01:51.549> that's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
instead of using all that sugar that's

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.730 
instead of using all that sugar that's
it<00:01:52.090> within<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.479> blood<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:53.290> starts<00:01:53.590> burning

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it within the blood it starts burning

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.660 
it within the blood it starts burning
fat<00:01:54.040> for<00:01:54.250> fuel<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.579> burns<00:01:54.939> ketones<00:01:56.670> so

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
fat for fuel and burns ketones so

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.190 
fat for fuel and burns ketones so
obviously<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.750> see<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.049> two

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
obviously you can see the two

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.069 
obviously you can see the two
differences<00:01:59.710> there<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.579> you<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.539> low<00:02:01.689> cover

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
differences there one you the low cover

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.160 
differences there one you the low cover
who<00:02:02.560> doesn't<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.460> not<00:02:03.850> eating<00:02:04.180> any<00:02:04.509> sugar<00:02:04.899> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
who doesn't is not eating any sugar and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.170 
who doesn't is not eating any sugar and
his<00:02:05.649> blood<00:02:05.920> sugar<00:02:06.250> level<00:02:06.579> should<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.880> really

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
his blood sugar level should be really

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.680 
his blood sugar level should be really
low<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:08.399> burning<00:02:09.399> fat<00:02:09.550> for<00:02:09.759> fuel<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.210> there

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
low is burning fat for fuel and there

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.880 
low is burning fat for fuel and there
boy<00:02:10.869> thereby<00:02:11.530> has<00:02:11.740> ketones

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
boy thereby has ketones

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.410 
boy thereby has ketones
the<00:02:12.980> other<00:02:13.130> one<00:02:13.340> whose<00:02:13.670> blood<00:02:13.940> sugar<00:02:14.330> is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
the other one whose blood sugar is

remember<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.239> said<00:03:41.410> 1123<00:03:42.410> would<00:03:42.860> be<00:03:43.010> normal<00:03:43.400> for

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
remember I said 1123 would be normal for

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.509 
remember I said 1123 would be normal for
a<00:03:43.610> ketogenic<00:03:43.940> diet<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.890> uncontrolled

a ketogenic diet the uncontrolled

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.750 
a ketogenic diet the uncontrolled
diabetes<00:03:46.700> is<00:03:47.269> more<00:03:47.870> than<00:03:48.049> 25<00:03:49.299> mmol<00:03:50.299> per<00:03:50.840> liter

diabetes is more than 25 mmol per liter

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.210 
diabetes is more than 25 mmol per liter
so<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.850> can<00:03:53.030> see<00:03:53.239> it's<00:03:53.870> not<00:03:54.079> simply<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.950> matter

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
so you can see it's not simply a matter

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.060 
so you can see it's not simply a matter
of<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.820> few<00:03:56.269> degrees<00:03:56.450> higher<00:03:56.690> it's<00:03:57.470> at<00:03:57.709> least

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
of a few degrees higher it's at least

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.090 
of a few degrees higher it's at least
almost<00:03:58.459> 10<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.180> 10<00:03:59.690> times<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.680> amount<00:04:00.739> of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
almost 10 to 10 times the amount of

almost 10 to 10 times the amount of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
ketones in the blood that you might see

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.530 
ketones in the blood that you might see
on<00:04:03.110> Atkins<00:04:03.680> diet<00:04:03.739> patient<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:05.390> a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
on Atkins diet patient so it's a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.229 
on Atkins diet patient so it's a
dramatic<00:04:06.200> increase<00:04:06.350> its<00:04:06.860> not<00:04:07.010> just<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.519> little

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
dramatic increase its not just a little

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.940 
dramatic increase its not just a little
bit<00:04:08.420> it's<00:04:08.840> not<00:04:08.959> just<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.380> few<00:04:09.560> degrees<00:04:09.709> higher

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
bit it's not just a few degrees higher

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.690 
bit it's not just a few degrees higher
it's<00:04:10.430> obviously<00:04:11.019> significant<00:04:12.220> well<00:04:13.220> there's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
it's obviously significant well there's

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.880 
it's obviously significant well there's
also<00:04:13.880> some<00:04:14.269> who<00:04:14.450> say<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.840> any<00:04:15.079> ketosis<00:04:15.680> is

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
also some who say that any ketosis is

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.039 
also some who say that any ketosis is
bad<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.519> they're<00:04:17.479> by<00:04:17.660> they're<00:04:17.900> also

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
