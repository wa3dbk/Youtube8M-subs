00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
not want to see these I can easily move

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.649 
not want to see these I can easily move
away<00:01:57.280> from<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.940> barrier<00:01:58.210> block<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.570> my

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
away from the barrier block in my

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.440 
away from the barrier block in my
inventory<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.500> these<00:02:00.430> entities<00:02:00.760> will

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
inventory and these entities will

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.240 
inventory and these entities will
disappear<00:02:02.080> and<00:02:02.260> you'll<00:02:02.470> no<00:02:02.680> longer<00:02:02.710> be<00:02:03.100> able

disappear and you'll no longer be able

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.060 
disappear and you'll no longer be able
to<00:02:03.610> see<00:02:03.880> exactly<00:02:04.659> where<00:02:05.320> they<00:02:05.409> are<00:02:05.530> unless<00:02:05.890> if

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
to see exactly where they are unless if

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.259 
to see exactly where they are unless if
you're<00:02:06.220> hovering<00:02:07.000> over<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:08.759> hitbox<00:02:09.759> which<00:02:10.149> of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
you're hovering over the hitbox which of

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.820 
you're hovering over the hitbox which of
course<00:02:10.300> would<00:02:10.629> be<00:02:10.690> difficult<00:02:11.379> if<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.560> didn't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
course would be difficult if you didn't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.030 
course would be difficult if you didn't
know<00:02:11.920> exactly<00:02:12.370> where<00:02:12.849> they<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:14.379> know<00:02:14.530> now

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
know exactly where they are you know now

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.220 
know exactly where they are you know now
you're<00:02:15.280> lost<00:02:15.459> good<00:02:16.090> news<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.720> always

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
you're lost good news is you can always

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.160 
you're lost good news is you can always
grab<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:18.010> barrier<00:02:18.370> again<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.019> after<00:02:20.019> a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
grab that barrier again and after a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.989 
grab that barrier again and after a
little<00:02:20.290> while<00:02:20.409> these<00:02:21.010> entities<00:02:21.340> will<00:02:21.700> pop

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
little while these entities will pop

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.010 
little while these entities will pop
back<00:02:22.359> into

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
back into

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.350 
back into
distance<00:02:23.320> here<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.100> you'll<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.640> able<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.150> see

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
distance here and you'll be able to see

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.390 
distance here and you'll be able to see
where<00:02:25.600> barrier<00:02:25.960> blocks<00:02:26.230> are<00:02:26.500> which<00:02:26.920> is<00:02:27.040> very

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
where barrier blocks are which is very

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.360 
where barrier blocks are which is very
very<00:02:27.880> useful<00:02:28.860> when<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:30.580> are<00:02:31.530> doing<00:02:32.530> big<00:02:33.010> map

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
very useful when you are doing big map

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.630 
very useful when you are doing big map
builds<00:02:33.940> no<00:02:34.570> barrier<00:02:34.840> blocks<00:02:35.200> aren't<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:36.040> you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
builds no barrier blocks aren't just you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.010 
builds no barrier blocks aren't just you
know<00:02:36.730> them<00:02:36.970> being<00:02:37.180> transparent<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
know them being transparent and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.100 
know them being transparent and
see-through<00:02:39.270> doesn't<00:02:40.270> mean<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.690> they<00:02:40.840> are

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
see-through doesn't mean that they are

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.970 
see-through doesn't mean that they are
wussy<00:02:41.860> little<00:02:42.520> blocks<00:02:43.110> they<00:02:44.110> will<00:02:44.350> support

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
wussy little blocks they will support

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.730 
wussy little blocks they will support
anything<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.150> support<00:02:46.450> sand<00:02:46.810> sand

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
anything so you can support sand sand

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.710 
anything so you can support sand sand
can<00:02:47.920> fall<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.550> them<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.150> everything's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can fall on to them and everything's

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.090 
can fall on to them and everything's
just<00:02:49.990> fine<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.440> can't<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.800> them<00:02:50.920> anymore

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
just fine you can't see them anymore

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.620 
just fine you can't see them anymore
because<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:51.640> moved<00:02:52.060> away<00:02:52.210> from<00:02:52.360> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
because I have moved away from the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.520 
because I have moved away from the
barrier<00:02:53.200> block<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.740> my<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.580> my<00:02:54.640> hand<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
barrier block in my in my hand so you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.710 
barrier block in my in my hand so you
won't<00:02:56.770> see<00:02:56.950> those<00:02:57.100> entities<00:02:57.550> anymore<00:02:58.090> but

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
won't see those entities anymore but

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480 
won't see those entities anymore but
they'll<00:02:58.840> support<00:02:59.170> any<00:02:59.410> block<00:02:59.740> that<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.280> put

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
they'll support any block that you put

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.090 
they'll support any block that you put
on<00:03:00.610> them<00:03:00.790> on<00:03:00.970> top<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.050> they<00:03:02.620> will<00:03:02.770> also

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
on them on top of that they will also

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.620 
on them on top of that they will also
support<00:03:03.570> redstone<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.980> either

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
support redstone and so you can either

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.900 
support redstone and so you can either
run<00:03:07.630> redstone<00:03:08.200> through<00:03:08.590> them<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.370> top<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.640> them

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
run redstone through them on top of them

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.030 
run redstone through them on top of them
on<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.210> side<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.450> them<00:03:10.690> just<00:03:11.230> like<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.650> so

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
on the side of them just like this so

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.100 
on the side of them just like this so
you'll<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.120> put<00:03:13.450> down<00:03:13.480> redstone

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
you'll see that I can put down redstone

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.990 
you'll see that I can put down redstone
on<00:03:14.290> top<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.710> barrier<00:03:14.920> blocks<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.730> want

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
on top of the barrier blocks if I want

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.980 
on top of the barrier blocks if I want
if<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.870> want<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.260> run<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.500> repeater<00:03:18.070> through

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
if I want to run a repeater through

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.760 
if I want to run a repeater through
these<00:03:19.990> barrier<00:03:20.650> blocks<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.250> will<00:03:21.610> work<00:03:21.940> this

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
these barrier blocks it will work this

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.590 
these barrier blocks it will work this
redstone<00:03:23.770> here<00:03:23.800> let<00:03:24.790> me<00:03:24.910> also<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.270> break

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
redstone here let me also just break

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.140 
redstone here let me also just break
this<00:03:27.090> it'll<00:03:28.090> also<00:03:28.980> power<00:03:29.980> redstone<00:03:30.790> from<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
this it'll also power redstone from the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.650 
this it'll also power redstone from the
other<00:03:31.300> side<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.050> this<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:33.510> mechanic<00:03:34.510> of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
other side so this is a mechanic of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.870 
other side so this is a mechanic of
redstone<00:03:35.020> is<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.620> power<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.520> block

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
redstone is that if you power a block

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.030 
redstone is that if you power a block
it'll<00:03:37.150> continue<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.900> power<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.770> other

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it'll continue to power on to the other

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.180 
it'll continue to power on to the other
side<00:03:39.340> or<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:40.360> can<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:40.930> know<00:03:41.050> make<00:03:41.530> sure<00:03:41.560> you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
side or we can you know make sure you

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.150 
side or we can you know make sure you
know<00:03:42.310> anyway<00:03:42.970> redstone<00:03:43.660> works<00:03:44.020> just<00:03:44.500> fine<00:03:44.740> on

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
know anyway redstone works just fine on

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.420 
know anyway redstone works just fine on
these<00:03:46.000> barrier<00:03:46.360> blocks<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.959> can<00:03:47.560> be<00:03:47.740> used<00:03:48.010> if

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
these barrier blocks and can be used if

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.960 
these barrier blocks and can be used if
if<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.209> want<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.540> run<00:03:49.810> redstone<00:03:50.770> along<00:03:50.980> along

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
if you want to run redstone along along

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.070 
if you want to run redstone along along
them<00:03:53.190> now<00:03:54.190> one<00:03:55.000> thing<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.209> they<00:03:55.420> can't<00:03:55.720> be<00:03:55.930> do

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
them now one thing that they can't be do

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.810 
them now one thing that they can't be do
they're<00:03:56.260> not<00:03:56.290> they're<00:03:56.709> not<00:03:56.740> exactly<00:03:57.490> like

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
they're not they're not exactly like

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.470

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
other blocks and that if you use a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
same way that fire does off of the torch

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.470 
same way that fire does off of the torch
not<00:04:52.270> normal<00:04:53.080> like<00:04:53.260> block<00:04:53.620> fire<00:04:53.950> but<00:04:54.610> fire<00:04:55.270> off

not normal like block fire but fire off
of<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.780> torturer<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.770> few<00:04:56.980> other<00:04:57.220> items<00:04:57.460> in

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.600 
of the torturer and a few other items in
Minecraft<00:04:58.810> will<00:04:58.990> always<00:04:59.500> face<00:04:59.770> you<00:05:00.040> but<00:05:00.460> it
