I decided to risk it and go into talena
and<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.270> figured<00:02:43.810> maybe<00:02:44.140> an<00:02:44.380> X<00:02:44.560> Izzard<00:02:44.770> would<00:02:44.980> be

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
and I figured maybe an X Izzard would be

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.560 
and I figured maybe an X Izzard would be
able<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.340> take<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.640> out<00:02:45.730> considering<00:02:46.300> how<00:02:46.420> much

something<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.820> was<00:03:10.000> really<00:03:10.030> scared<00:03:10.390> about<00:03:10.510> I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
something I was really scared about I

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
something I was really scared about I
didn't<00:03:11.380> want<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> over<00:03:11.800> predict<00:03:12.100> again<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.850> you

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
didn't want to over predict again so you

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.580 
didn't want to over predict again so you
know<00:03:13.480> I<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.570> want<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.900> be<00:03:14.080> safe<00:03:14.320> but

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
know I just want to be safe but

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.030 
know I just want to be safe but
unfortunately<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> import<00:03:15.730> opponent

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
unfortunately the import opponent

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.440 
unfortunately the import opponent
predicts<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.160> switch<00:03:18.490> really<00:03:18.940> well<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.300> goes

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
predicts my switch really well and goes

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.510 
predicts my switch really well and goes
for<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.690> nasty<00:03:19.930> plot<00:03:20.380> instead<00:03:20.830> so<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
for a nasty plot instead so this is just

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.820 
for a nasty plot instead so this is just
even<00:03:21.880> more<00:03:22.180> worse<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.750> i<00:03:23.110> go<00:03:23.290> into<00:03:23.440> ray<00:03:23.650> and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
even more worse and i go into ray and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.770 
even more worse and i go into ray and
because<00:03:24.280> she's<00:03:24.490> like<00:03:24.640> my<00:03:24.760> special<00:03:25.240> wall<00:03:25.480> type

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
because she's like my special wall type

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.170 
because she's like my special wall type
of<00:03:25.930> thing<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.070> didn't<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:27.760> how<00:03:27.940> well

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
of thing and I didn't know how well

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.420 
of thing and I didn't know how well
she'd<00:03:28.420> be<00:03:28.510> able<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.690> take<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.870> air<00:03:28.990> /<00:03:29.430> boosted

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
she'd be able to take it air / boosted

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.430 
she'd be able to take it air / boosted
air<00:03:30.550> /<00:03:30.820> there's<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.150> ton<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> damage<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.290> get

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
air / there's a ton of damage and I get

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.010 
air / there's a ton of damage and I get
the<00:03:32.560> flames<00:03:32.830> which<00:03:33.040> really<00:03:33.280> sucks<00:03:33.750> but<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.930> a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
the flames which really sucks but in a

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.660 
the flames which really sucks but in a
way<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.170> guess<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:35.709> don't<00:03:36.100> think<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.430> bad

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
way I guess I don't think it's that bad

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.949 
way I guess I don't think it's that bad
because<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.030> can't<00:03:37.240> really<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.540> anything<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
because I can't really do anything to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.400 
because I can't really do anything to
toe<00:03:38.110> bukas<00:03:38.410> anyway<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.690> unfortunately<00:03:40.690> Ryan

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
toe bukas anyway and unfortunately Ryan

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.610 
toe bukas anyway and unfortunately Ryan
goes<00:03:41.680> down<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:43.209> definitely<00:03:43.570> not<00:03:44.560> good

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
goes down so that is definitely not good

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.220 
goes down so that is definitely not good
as<00:03:45.160> ran<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> big<00:03:46.150> part<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:46.690> team<00:03:47.170> I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
as ran is a big part of this team I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.530 
as ran is a big part of this team I
thought<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.370> i<00:03:48.400> go<00:03:48.550> into<00:03:48.700> brave<00:03:49.000> are<00:03:49.180> these<00:03:49.360> all

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
thought so i go into brave are these all

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.240 
thought so i go into brave are these all
brave<00:03:49.840> charging<00:03:50.350> into<00:03:50.530> battle<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:50.980> hoped

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
brave charging into battle and I hoped

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.470 
brave charging into battle and I hoped
it<00:03:51.430> would<00:03:51.519> be<00:03:51.550> enough<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.000> scare<00:03:52.300> away<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
it would be enough to scare away the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.420 
it would be enough to scare away the
Toba<00:03:52.870> kiss<00:03:53.019> which<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.320> does<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.769> go<00:03:54.220> for<00:03:54.400> a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
Toba kiss which it does I go for a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.860 
Toba kiss which it does I go for a
thunderbolt<00:03:54.940> again<00:03:55.269> I<00:03:55.300> didn't<00:03:55.540> want<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.750> over

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
thunderbolt again I didn't want to over

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.140 
thunderbolt again I didn't want to over
predict<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:56.709> he<00:03:56.830> goes<00:03:57.010> into<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.310> camera<00:03:57.790> which

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
predict but he goes into a camera which

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.699 
predict but he goes into a camera which
obviously<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.930> not<00:03:59.050> affected<00:03:59.530> by<00:03:59.560> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
obviously is not affected by the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.250 
obviously is not affected by the
Thunderbolt<00:04:00.250> being<00:04:00.640> apart<00:04:00.970> ground<00:04:01.209> time<00:04:01.420> so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
Thunderbolt being apart ground time so

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.990 
Thunderbolt being apart ground time so
at<00:04:02.380> this<00:04:02.440> point<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.980> tried<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.580> go<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:03.700> hidden

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
at this point I tried to go for hidden

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.250 
at this point I tried to go for hidden
powers<00:04:04.390> see<00:04:04.570> how<00:04:04.690> much<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.930> would<00:04:05.019> do

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
powers see how much it would do

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.820 
powers see how much it would do
unfortunately<00:04:05.560> did<00:04:06.400> crap<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.090> was<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.570> oh

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
he probably expected me a switch and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
but unfortunately for me he used his lab

but unfortunately for me he used his lab
la<00:04:22.840> plume<00:04:23.140> which<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> special<00:04:24.850> attack<00:04:25.090> that
