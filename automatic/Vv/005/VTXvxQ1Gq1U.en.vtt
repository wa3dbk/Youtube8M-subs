first<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.210> it's<00:00:57.210> fine<00:00:57.859> he's<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.070> some<00:00:59.219> nice

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
first time it's fine he's got some nice

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
first time it's fine he's got some nice
trick<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.940> dare<00:01:00.120> he's<00:01:00.270> leaving<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.809> well<00:01:01.109> when

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
trick we dare he's leaving in well when

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.750 
trick we dare he's leaving in well when
he's<00:01:01.410> throwing<00:01:01.710> shots<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.160> he's<00:01:02.280> moving<00:01:02.579> but

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
he's throwing shots as he's moving but

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
he's throwing shots as he's moving but
the<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.270> powerful<00:01:03.600> fire<00:01:04.019> seems<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the more powerful fire seems to be

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
the more powerful fire seems to be
Bisutti<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> he<00:01:05.489> looks<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:05.880> he<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.299> take

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
Bisutti and he looks as if he can take

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.600 
Bisutti and he looks as if he can take
him<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.950> seems<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
him in so you know this seems to be to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.679 
him in so you know this seems to be to
buy<00:01:08.729> out<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> pattern<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.450> looking

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
buy out the pattern that we're looking

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.429 
buy out the pattern that we're looking
at<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:10.820> yeah<00:01:11.820> exactly<00:01:12.180> i<00:01:12.570> mean<00:01:12.720> lopez<00:01:13.020> should
