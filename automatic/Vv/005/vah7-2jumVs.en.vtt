adding and subtracting linear

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.249 
adding and subtracting linear
expressions<00:00:04.640> okay<00:00:05.640> your<00:00:05.850> vocabulary<00:00:06.210> what<00:00:07.140> is

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
expressions okay your vocabulary what is

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.830 
expressions okay your vocabulary what is
the<00:00:07.379> linear<00:00:07.529> expression<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:09.059> an<00:00:09.240> algebraic

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
the linear expression it's an algebraic

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.470 
the linear expression it's an algebraic
expression<00:00:10.650> remember<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.910> letters<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
expression remember this is letters and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.539 
expression remember this is letters and
numbers<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.139> no<00:00:13.320> doesn't<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.160> equal

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
numbers to have no doesn't have equal

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790 
numbers to have no doesn't have equal
sign<00:00:14.759> that's<00:00:15.059> an<00:00:15.150> equation<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.320> expression

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
sign that's an equation the expression

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.580 
sign that's an equation the expression
is<00:00:16.920> without<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.400> equal<00:00:17.670> sign<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
is without the equal sign in which the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.870 
is without the equal sign in which the
exponent<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> variable<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.590> one<00:00:22.880> so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
exponent of the variable is one so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.370 
exponent of the variable is one so
here's<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.240> examples<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> linear

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
here's some examples of the linear

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.349 
here's some examples of the linear
expressions<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.580> notice<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.090> these

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
expressions if you notice all of these

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
expressions if you notice all of these
the<00:00:27.750> variable<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> X<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> doesn't<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the variable is X it doesn't have to be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.370 
the variable is X it doesn't have to be
X<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.150> all<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.810> X's<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> first<00:00:32.279> power

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
X but all the X's are to the first power

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.240 
X but all the X's are to the first power
that<00:00:34.380> would<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> linear<00:00:34.950> expression

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
that would be a linear expression

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
that would be a linear expression
nonlinear<00:00:38.250> expression<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.030> notice<00:00:39.480> here

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
nonlinear expression if you notice here

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.090 
nonlinear expression if you notice here
is<00:00:40.550> any<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.320> expression<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.950> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
is any of our expression that is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
is any of our expression that is
represented<00:00:44.760> by<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> variable<00:00:45.390> raised<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
represented by a variable raised to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.900 
represented by a variable raised to
something<00:00:46.500> else<00:00:46.680> besides<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.399> first<00:00:47.550> power

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
something else besides the first power

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
something else besides the first power
now<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.719> may<00:00:48.870> see<00:00:48.930> x<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.710> raised<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
now you may see x over here raised to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
now you may see x over here raised to
the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.520> power<00:00:50.660> but<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> depends<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the first power but it depends on that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
the first power but it depends on that
first<00:00:52.829> term<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:54.180> 12<00:00:54.480> X<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> third<00:00:55.469> here

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
first term that 12 X to the third here

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
first term that 12 X to the third here
whether<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.270> nonlinear

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
whether or not it's a nonlinear

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
whether or not it's a nonlinear
expression<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.070> not<00:01:00.140> okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.199> first<00:01:01.649> thing

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
expression or not okay so first thing

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.130 
expression or not okay so first thing
we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> talk<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.399> adding<00:01:03.140> linear

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
we're going to talk about adding linear

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.170 
we're going to talk about adding linear
expressions<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:05.460> gonna<00:01:05.549> find<00:01:05.909> each<00:01:06.210> some

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
expressions we're gonna find each some

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.100 
expressions we're gonna find each some
okay<00:01:09.180> first<00:01:09.450> example<00:01:10.020> X<00:01:10.229> minus<00:01:10.799> 2<00:01:11.100> plus<00:01:12.110> 3x

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
okay first example X minus 2 plus 3x

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.730 
okay first example X minus 2 plus 3x
plus<00:01:13.439> 8<00:01:14.960> we're<00:01:15.960> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> vertical

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
plus 8 we're going to use the vertical

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.390 
plus 8 we're going to use the vertical
method<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:18.439> solve<00:01:19.439> these<00:01:19.590> problems<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
method to solve these problems if you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
method to solve these problems if you
want<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> horizontal<00:01:21.060> method<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
want to use the horizontal method just

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.530 
want to use the horizontal method just
adding<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.100> terms<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.729> can<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
adding your like terms you can do that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
adding your like terms you can do that
so<00:01:25.259> we're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> align<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.700> terms

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so we're going to align the like terms

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.620 
so we're going to align the like terms
vertically<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:28.020> we're<00:01:28.140> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> add

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
vertically and then we're going to add

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
vertically and then we're going to add
now<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.170> notice<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.130> did<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.520> X

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
now if you notice here what I did with X

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.319 
now if you notice here what I did with X
minus<00:01:33.240> 2<00:01:33.500> you<00:01:34.500> need<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
minus 2 you need to know that if you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.219 
minus 2 you need to know that if you
just<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.750> an<00:01:37.500> X<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.430> means<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.509> X

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
just have an X that means you have one X

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.030 
just have an X that means you have one X
that's<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.770> X

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that's all there is there's just one X

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's all there is there's just one X
no<00:01:44.520> more<00:01:44.759> no<00:01:44.939> less<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> put<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> 1

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
no more no less so I'm going to put a 1

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
no more no less so I'm going to put a 1
in<00:01:46.740> front<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.280> X<00:01:47.570> just<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.810> adding

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
in front of that X just for adding

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.800 
in front of that X just for adding
purposes<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.729> we're<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> first<00:01:51.299> add<00:01:51.570> our

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
purposes so we're going to first add our

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.319 
purposes so we're going to first add our
constants<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.490> right<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.299> have

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
constants over here to the right we have

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.590 
constants over here to the right we have
minus<00:01:55.229> 2<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> chase<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.420> plus

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
minus 2 and if you want to chase up plus

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.580 
minus 2 and if you want to chase up plus
a<00:01:57.630> negative<00:01:57.899> 2<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.640> minus<00:02:00.180> 2<00:02:00.479> plus<00:02:01.290> 8

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a negative 2 you can so minus 2 plus 8

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.459 
a negative 2 you can so minus 2 plus 8
different<00:02:02.579> signs<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.600> subtract<00:02:04.140> if

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
different signs we actually subtract if

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.399 
different signs we actually subtract if
you<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.880> questions<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.780> integer<00:02:07.170> rules

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you have questions on your integer rules

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.199 
you have questions on your integer rules
you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.829> go<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.340> watch<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> adding<00:02:09.060> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you can go back and watch the adding and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880 
you can go back and watch the adding and
subtracting<00:02:09.599> integers

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
subtracting integers

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.700 
subtracting integers
so<00:02:11.820> minus<00:02:12.240> two<00:02:12.480> plus<00:02:12.690> eight<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.560> give

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
so minus two plus eight is going to give

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.940 
so minus two plus eight is going to give
us<00:02:13.830> plus<00:02:14.130> six<00:02:14.550> that's<00:02:15.650> going<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.710> give<00:02:16.830> us<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
us plus six that's going to give us a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.990 
us plus six that's going to give us a
positive<00:02:17.190> six<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.050> have<00:02:19.440> 1x<00:02:19.970> plus<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
positive six and then we have 1x plus a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.710 
positive six and then we have 1x plus a
3<00:02:21.390> X<00:02:21.420> which<00:02:21.840> would<00:02:21.990> give<00:02:22.200> us<00:02:22.230> four<00:02:22.770> X's<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
3 X which would give us four X's and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.890 
3 X which would give us four X's and
that<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> our<00:02:25.020> answer

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
that is our answer

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.750 
that is our answer
okay<00:02:27.900> example<00:02:28.320> number<00:02:28.500> two<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.580> have<00:02:29.670> a

okay example number two you have a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.780 
okay example number two you have a
negative<00:02:30.060> 4y<00:02:30.540> plus<00:02:31.320> 3<00:02:31.740> plus<00:02:32.670> 11<00:02:33.060> y<00:02:33.690> minus<00:02:34.590> 5

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
negative 4y plus 3 plus 11 y minus 5

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.160 
negative 4y plus 3 plus 11 y minus 5
we're<00:02:35.790> gonna<00:02:35.910> do<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> same<00:02:36.540> thing<00:02:36.600> use<00:02:37.050> the

negative 2 it's up to you whatever you
feel<00:03:08.640> more<00:03:08.760> comfortable<00:03:09.060> with<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
feel more comfortable with and then you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.110 
feel more comfortable with and then you
have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.010> negative<00:03:11.400> 4y<00:03:12.320> plus<00:03:13.320> 11<00:03:13.980> Y<00:03:14.160> which<00:03:14.970> we

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
have a negative 4y plus 11 Y which we

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.150 
have a negative 4y plus 11 Y which we
give<00:03:15.300> me<00:03:15.540> 7<00:03:16.260> Y<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.750> answer

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.280 

okay<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:23.910> if<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> check<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.720> problem<00:03:25.170> out

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
okay now if you check this problem out

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.840 
okay now if you check this problem out
we<00:03:25.500> have<00:03:25.620> 2<00:03:25.860> times<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.550> negative<00:03:27.090> 7<00:03:27.360> Z<00:03:27.750> +<00:03:28.170> 3<00:03:28.530> +<00:03:29.100> 5<00:03:29.550> Z

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
we have 2 times a negative 7 Z + 3 + 5 Z

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.190 
we have 2 times a negative 7 Z + 3 + 5 Z
minus<00:03:30.690> 2<00:03:31.580> we're<00:03:32.580> gonna<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.210> first<00:03:33.540> use

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
minus 2 we're gonna have to first use

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.620 
minus 2 we're gonna have to first use
the<00:03:34.710> distributive<00:03:35.100> property<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:36.240> clean<00:03:36.510> this

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
the distributive property to clean this

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.030 
the distributive property to clean this
problem<00:03:37.080> up<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:39.080> 2<00:03:40.080> times<00:03:40.920> the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
problem up so we have 2 times the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.370 
problem up so we have 2 times the
negative<00:03:41.280> 7z<00:03:42.209> which<00:03:42.720> would<00:03:42.930> give<00:03:43.110> us<00:03:43.140> a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
negative 7z which would give us a

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.550 
negative 7z which would give us a
negative<00:03:43.610> 14<00:03:44.610> Z<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.230> we're<00:03:46.320> going<00:03:46.440> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
negative 14 Z and then we're going to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.520 
negative 14 Z and then we're going to
distribute<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.430> us<00:03:47.670> well<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.750> 3<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.440> 2

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
distribute that to us well to the 3 so 2

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.160 
distribute that to us well to the 3 so 2
times<00:03:49.980> 3<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.400> 6<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.060> we're<00:03:51.780> going<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.959> bring

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
times 3 is 6 so we're going to bring

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.820 
times 3 is 6 so we're going to bring
that<00:03:52.200> down<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:54.080> now<00:03:55.080> we're<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
that down and now we're going to

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.430 
that down and now we're going to
continue<00:03:56.250> as<00:03:56.700> we<00:03:56.880> were<00:03:57.030> earlier<00:03:57.570> use<00:03:58.290> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
continue as we were earlier use the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.980 
continue as we were earlier use the
vertical<00:03:58.650> method<00:04:01.459> make<00:04:02.459> sure<00:04:02.640> our<00:04:02.760> terms<00:04:03.660> are

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
vertical method make sure our terms are

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.470 
vertical method make sure our terms are
like<00:04:04.260> terms<00:04:04.320> are<00:04:04.920> lined<00:04:05.160> up<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.670> we<00:04:06.330> can

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
like terms are lined up and that we can

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.310 
like terms are lined up and that we can
add<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:07.320> have<00:04:07.350> plus<00:04:07.860> 6<00:04:08.250> positive<00:04:09.150> 6<00:04:09.420> minus<00:04:10.050> 2

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
add we have plus 6 positive 6 minus 2

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.350 
add we have plus 6 positive 6 minus 2
which<00:04:11.220> gives<00:04:11.250> me<00:04:11.670> positive<00:04:12.330> 4<00:04:13.820> we<00:04:14.820> also<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.330> a

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
which gives me positive 4 we also have a

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.310 
which gives me positive 4 we also have a
negative<00:04:15.750> 14<00:04:16.500> z<00:04:16.890> plus<00:04:17.609> 5z<00:04:17.989> which<00:04:18.989> would<00:04:19.169> give

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
negative 14 z plus 5z which would give

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.270 
negative 14 z plus 5z which would give
me<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> negative<00:04:20.070> none

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
me a negative none

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.940 
me a negative none
z<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.050> our<00:04:23.200> answer<00:04:23.350> we<00:04:23.650> cannot

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
z and that is our answer we cannot

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.770 
z and that is our answer we cannot
simplify<00:04:24.460> anymore<00:04:27.360> okay<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:28.480> we're<00:04:28.600> going<00:04:28.690> to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
simplify anymore okay now we're going to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.170 
simplify anymore okay now we're going to

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.909 
look at subtracting linear expressions
we're<00:04:31.690> gonna<00:04:31.780> find<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.350> difference<00:04:34.050> okay<00:04:35.050> now

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
we're gonna find the difference okay now

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.560 
we're gonna find the difference okay now
there's<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.220> few<00:04:36.460> things<00:04:36.700> here<00:04:36.940> that<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.180> won't

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
there's a few things here that I won't

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.100 
there's a few things here that I won't
just<00:04:37.780> show<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.460> first<00:04:39.460> thing<00:04:39.730> is<00:04:39.910> just<00:04:40.270> like

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
just show you first thing is just like

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.890 
just show you first thing is just like
when<00:04:41.410> we're<00:04:41.620> subtracting<00:04:42.060> integers<00:04:43.060> we're

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
when we're subtracting integers we're

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.290 
when we're subtracting integers we're
gonna<00:04:44.020> want<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.440> keep<00:04:44.620> change<00:04:44.889> change<00:04:45.340> but

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
gonna want to keep change change but

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.530 
gonna want to keep change change but
here<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:47.410> last<00:04:47.800> change<00:04:48.310> where<00:04:49.120> we<00:04:49.150> change

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
here that last change where we change

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.050 
here that last change where we change
things<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.230> opposite<00:04:50.710> we're<00:04:51.639> gonna<00:04:51.790> do

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
things to the opposite we're gonna do

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.510 
things to the opposite we're gonna do
that<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:52.450> both<00:04:53.100> numbers<00:04:54.100> that<00:04:54.250> are<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.430> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that with both numbers that are in the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.960 
that with both numbers that are in the
parentheses<00:04:55.200> because<00:04:56.200> there<00:04:56.380> is<00:04:56.470> one<00:04:57.250> so

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
parentheses because there is one so

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.870 
parentheses because there is one so
you're<00:04:58.120> gonna<00:04:58.270> have<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.600> do<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.960> both<00:05:01.740> so

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
you're gonna have to do it to both so

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.750 
you're gonna have to do it to both so
keep<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.090> first<00:05:04.300> term<00:05:04.980> change<00:05:05.980> your<00:05:06.160> minus<00:05:06.580> to

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
keep the first term change your minus to

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.320 
keep the first term change your minus to
a<00:05:06.790> plus<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:07.740> then<00:05:08.740> you're<00:05:09.640> going<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:09.970> change

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
a plus and then you're going to change

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.710 
a plus and then you're going to change
the<00:05:10.690> positive<00:05:11.290> two<00:05:11.530> into<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.040> negative<00:05:12.400> 2y<00:05:12.850> and

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
the positive two into a negative 2y and

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:22.230 
the positive two into a negative 2y and
then<00:05:14.280> change<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.580> minus<00:05:16.150> 8<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.919> +8<00:05:21.060> change<00:05:22.060> it

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
then change the minus 8 to +8 change it

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.760 
then change the minus 8 to +8 change it
to<00:05:22.389> both<00:05:22.630> terms<00:05:24.390> okay

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.170 

what<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.430> did<00:05:29.759> here<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.300> I<00:05:31.190> switched<00:05:32.539> my<00:05:33.539> -<00:05:34.440> for

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
what I did here is I switched my - for

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.670 
what I did here is I switched my - for
4-5<00:05:36.180> y<00:05:36.720> 2<00:05:37.560> -<00:05:38.280> 5<00:05:38.460> y<00:05:38.729> +<00:05:39.060> 4<00:05:39.330> but<00:05:39.930> this<00:05:40.080> is<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.440> same

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
4-5 y 2 - 5 y + 4 but this is the same

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.189 
4-5 y 2 - 5 y + 4 but this is the same
thing<00:05:40.889> all<00:05:41.159> I<00:05:41.310> did<00:05:41.490> was<00:05:41.729> flip<00:05:42.120> it<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.870> was<00:05:43.080> the

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
thing all I did was flip it this was the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.830 
thing all I did was flip it this was the
negative<00:05:43.379> 5<00:05:43.800> why<00:05:44.039> is<00:05:44.639> that<00:05:44.669> -<00:05:44.970> guys<00:05:45.300> with<00:05:45.509> the<00:05:45.629> 5

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
negative 5 why is that - guys with the 5

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.930 
negative 5 why is that - guys with the 5
and<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:46.650> is<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:47.009> positive<00:05:47.190> 4

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
and this is the positive 4

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.089 
and this is the positive 4
the<00:05:48.270> reason<00:05:48.569> I<00:05:48.659> did<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:48.930> is<00:05:49.440> because<00:05:49.800> I'm

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
the reason I did that is because I'm

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.010 
the reason I did that is because I'm
going<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.490> want<00:05:50.699> my<00:05:50.909> terms

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
going to want my terms

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.279 
going to want my terms
to<00:05:52.379> line<00:05:52.650> up<00:05:53.120> whenever<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.419> bring<00:05:54.900> them<00:05:55.139> over

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
to line up whenever I bring them over

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.290 
to line up whenever I bring them over
vertically<00:05:55.949> and<00:05:56.490> that<00:05:56.669> is<00:05:56.819> what<00:05:56.970> I'm<00:05:57.060> going<00:05:57.240> to

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
vertically and that is what I'm going to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.589 
vertically and that is what I'm going to
do<00:05:57.509> now<00:05:58.050> my<00:05:58.259> Y's<00:05:58.500> are<00:05:58.800> first<00:05:59.039> in<00:05:59.430> my<00:05:59.940> constants

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
do now my Y's are first in my constants

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.620 
do now my Y's are first in my constants
your<00:06:00.810> second<00:06:01.759> so<00:06:02.759> I'm<00:06:02.819> going<00:06:03.030> to<00:06:03.090> line<00:06:03.270> them<00:06:03.449> up

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
your second so I'm going to line them up

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.210 
your second so I'm going to line them up
4<00:06:04.440> plus<00:06:04.710> 8<00:06:04.889> is<00:06:05.099> 12<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:06.360> then<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.289> negative<00:06:07.770> 5y

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
4 plus 8 is 12 and then a negative 5y

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.309 
4 plus 8 is 12 and then a negative 5y
plus<00:06:08.819> a<00:06:08.849> negative<00:06:09.180> 2y<00:06:09.599> would<00:06:09.990> give<00:06:10.110> me<00:06:10.289> a

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
plus a negative 2y would give me a

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:16.760 
plus a negative 2y would give me a
negative<00:06:10.759> 7y<00:06:11.759> and<00:06:12.479> that<00:06:13.349> is<00:06:13.530> our<00:06:13.680> answer<00:06:15.770> okay

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
negative 7y and that is our answer okay

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.920 
negative 7y and that is our answer okay
