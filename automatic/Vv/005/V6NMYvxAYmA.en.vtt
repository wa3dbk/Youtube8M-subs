00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.790
 hello everyone in the scene today 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.140
 I will teach how to define the eyebrows so that 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.420
 stay as is 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 very well and now we will repeat what 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 we have done with the other eyebrow in this 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.920
 another first we have to take some 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.530
 tweezers 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.110
 to be able to remove the excess hairs of 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.780
 the eyebrow 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.780
 we will be removing the little by little 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.570
 so later when we apply a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.870
 makeup is much more defined to the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.870
 eyebrow 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.980
 very well as you can see we have already removed the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.700
 most of the praying hairs and now 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.650
 we proceed to paint a little eyebrow 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.880
 first I have chosen this color that you see 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.100
 here 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.350
 so that it is not so much the contrast and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.740
 then give it a little darker color 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.840
 then we will take with a very 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:09.030
 small as you see here 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 and we will apply a little on the eyebrow 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.400
 not much because then we will have to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.060
 apply a darker color 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.380
 very well and the second color would be this 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 what do you see here is worth 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.619
 we go down a little bit because this is a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.759
 much darker tone before we give in a 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.759
 small amount 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 and it would be more or less like that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.490
 and finally the last step would be 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.400
 apply a little with a pencil of a tone 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.260
 brown the imperfections that we can 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.150
 see or the hair holes that we can 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.410
 see then we are applying little to 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.410
 little so you do not notice much 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.790
 and we had the eyebrow 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.550
 you can also blur a bit with the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.550
 finger if you see that you have spent in a 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.550
 piece 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.810
 and so 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.410
 we would have the eyebrow 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.970
 very defined 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.800
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.760
 tutorial and here you have the result of 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.590
 the two eyebrows 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.590
 thank you very much and see you next time
