coverage<00:00:54.089> on<00:00:54.269> them<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.929> I<00:00:55.409> use<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.949> on

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
coverage on them there and I use them on

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
coverage on them there and I use them on
every<00:00:56.909> single<00:00:57.179> piece<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> equipment<00:00:58.139> that<00:00:58.319> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
every single piece of equipment that I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.180 
every single piece of equipment that I
own<00:00:58.889> including<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.609> TV<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.600> skybox<00:01:01.199> my

own including my TV the skybox my
blu-ray<00:01:02.670> player<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.299> of<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.629> computer

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
blu-ray player all of my computer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440 
blu-ray player all of my computer
equipment<00:01:04.610> always<00:01:05.610> goes<00:01:05.880> into<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> surge

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
equipment always goes into a surge

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.600 
equipment always goes into a surge
protector<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:07.620> reason<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
protector the reason I do that is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.640 
protector the reason I do that is
because<00:01:09.120> if<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.810> electrical<00:01:10.260> spike

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
because if there is an electrical spike

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
because if there is an electrical spike
or<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> surge<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.579> electricity<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
or a surge in the electricity it

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
or a surge in the electricity it
protects<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> equipment<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.340> haven't<00:01:14.610> got

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
protects the equipment you haven't got

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.029 
protects the equipment you haven't got
replaced<00:01:15.149> expensive<00:01:15.810> equipment<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
replaced expensive equipment and you

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:18.620 
replaced expensive equipment and you
also<00:01:17.130> normally<00:01:17.969> with<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.360> surge

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
also normally with these surge

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.410 
also normally with these surge
protectors<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.710> some<00:01:19.950> sort<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> insurance

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
protectors get some sort of insurance

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.690 
protectors get some sort of insurance
cover<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.920> they<00:01:22.950> normally<00:01:23.549> do

their surge protectors gets damaged
during<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.609> electrical<00:01:33.119> surge<00:01:33.509> perhaps

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
during an electrical surge perhaps

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.770 
during an electrical surge perhaps
during<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> thunderstorm<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.549> something<00:01:36.000> then

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you will get that piece of equipment

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.810 
you will get that piece of equipment
replaced<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.140> gets<00:01:40.289> damaged<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.399> they<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
replaced if it gets damaged so they and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
coverage as well other manufacturers say

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
coverage as well other manufacturers say
that<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.039> replace<00:01:47.460> equipment<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.179> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that they replace equipment up to a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.969 
that they replace equipment up to a
certain<00:01:48.780> amount<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.170> money<00:01:49.409> if<00:01:49.679> it<00:01:49.799> gets

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
certain amount of money if it gets

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.099 
certain amount of money if it gets
damaged<00:01:50.429> what's<00:01:51.090> connected<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> their

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
damaged what's connected to one of their

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.889 
damaged what's connected to one of their
source<00:01:52.560> surge<00:01:52.829> protectors<00:01:53.429> so<00:01:54.329> very

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
source surge protectors so very

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.859 
source surge protectors so very
worthwhile<00:01:55.609> investing<00:01:56.609> in<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.479> start

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
worthwhile investing in one they start

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.989 
worthwhile investing in one they start
round<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.100> about<00:01:59.280> five<00:01:59.609> or<00:01:59.759> six

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
round about I think about five or six

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.029 
round about I think about five or six
pounds<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.539> single<00:02:00.899> plug<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.950> they're

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
pounds for a single plug one so they're

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.249 
pounds for a single plug one so they're
not<00:02:02.249> very<00:02:02.310> expensive<00:02:03.179> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.079> pay

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
not very expensive and then you can pay
