00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
you grab the cucumber and you can just

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.410 
you grab the cucumber and you can just
go<00:03:48.130> back<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.340> forth<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.850> it<00:03:48.910> makes<00:03:49.060> these

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
go back and forth and it makes these

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.699 
go back and forth and it makes these
just<00:03:49.990> wait<00:03:50.530> for<00:03:50.770> thin<00:03:52.500> slices<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.590> cucumber

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
just wait for thin slices of cucumber

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.589 
just wait for thin slices of cucumber
once<00:03:54.700> kind<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.000> neat<00:03:55.120> when<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.330> do<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.569> this

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
once kind of neat when you do it this

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.979 
once kind of neat when you do it this
way<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:57.270> don't<00:03:58.270> know<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.450> seems<00:03:58.660> like<00:03:58.750> these

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
way is I don't know it seems like these

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.420 
way is I don't know it seems like these
cucumbers<00:03:59.260> go<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.590> lot<00:03:59.770> further<00:04:00.040> when<00:04:00.370> you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
cucumbers go a lot further when you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.640 
cucumbers go a lot further when you
don't<00:04:00.550> have<00:04:00.610> big<00:04:00.819> chunks<00:04:00.849> I<00:04:01.420> mean<00:04:02.260> maybe<00:04:02.440> not

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
don't have big chunks I mean maybe not

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.140 
don't have big chunks I mean maybe not
eating<00:04:02.890> as<00:04:02.980> much<00:04:03.010> cucumbers<00:04:03.610> if<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.849> would<00:04:04.000> put

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
eating as much cucumbers if I would put

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.000 
eating as much cucumbers if I would put
two<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> salad<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.770> really<00:04:05.920> seems

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
two in the salad but it really seems

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.600 
two in the salad but it really seems
like<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.400> lot<00:04:06.640> of<00:04:06.670> cucumber<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.780> know<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.610> so

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
like a lot of cucumber you know and so

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.280 
like a lot of cucumber you know and so
it<00:04:09.730> goes<00:04:09.760> fast<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.510> see<00:04:10.600> how<00:04:10.660> fast<00:04:10.840> download

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
it goes fast you see how fast download

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.590 
it goes fast you see how fast download
so<00:04:11.920> say<00:04:12.430> anything<00:04:12.760> below<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:12.970> carrot<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.480> can

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
so say anything below the carrot you can

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.809 
so say anything below the carrot you can
just<00:04:13.750> go<00:04:14.200> back<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.440> forth<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.400> gotta<00:04:15.580> kind<00:04:15.760> of

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
just go back and forth you gotta kind of

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.759 
just go back and forth you gotta kind of
mind<00:04:16.060> where<00:04:16.359> your<00:04:16.480> fingers<00:04:16.810> are<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.320> relation

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
auction say cheap but less expensive

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.280 
auction say cheap but less expensive
version<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.610> seem<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.850> have<00:04:33.880> more<00:04:34.060> control

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
version and I seem to have more control

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.570 
version and I seem to have more control
so<00:04:35.290> what<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.440> do<00:04:35.530> is<00:04:35.620> go<00:04:36.100> back<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.430> forth

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
so what I do is go back and forth

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.129 
so what I do is go back and forth
because<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.180> blade<00:04:37.419> cuts<00:04:37.690> on<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.900> way<00:04:38.020> up

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
because this blade cuts on the way up

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.900 
because this blade cuts on the way up
and<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.650> way<00:04:38.740> down<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.550> just<00:04:39.639> go<00:04:39.760> back

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
and on the way down so you just go back

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.420 
and on the way down so you just go back
and<00:04:39.940> forth<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.570> like<00:04:40.750> crazy<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.190> these

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
and forth like this like crazy and these

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.219 
and forth like this like crazy and these
things<00:04:42.669> are<00:04:42.880> so<00:04:43.150> thin<00:04:43.540> these<00:04:43.810> pieces<00:04:44.020> of

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
things are so thin these pieces of

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:45.930 
things are so thin these pieces of
