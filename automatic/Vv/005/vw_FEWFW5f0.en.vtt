00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.340

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.410
 ask moment so-called oven diet 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.190

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.440

 know all about everything about it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.290
 you don't know what it is looking for 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.600
 then on my channel 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.560
 type a title k up and down with 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.350
 a car I get or this is revenge 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.030
 from the viewer and that question was I am 14 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 years and how did you follow that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.560
 so advise 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.410
 well such a head no she 14 years at the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.460
 almost real in growth heavy and growing and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.870
 I need this to get all the nutrients 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 Build your body everything that the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.530
 boot from your muscles that your bones to the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.990
 everything just very important 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 that you eat well but then it just comes 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.420
 we are overweight you are very fat and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.490
 how you are already lucky there 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.150
 How will a very good way 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 but I'd be with you first 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.310
 parents with the doctor with a dietician 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.020
 Start talking about how you change your life pattern 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.020
 whether you can change your diet 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.720
 because i think if you live less 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.610
 calories did more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.220
 watch those carbohydrates again 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 I mean especially those sugars is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.100
 a big culprit that you are there 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.690
 that your 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.820
 in many rat you can lose that better 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.100
 comes out to see and spicy 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 will start to feel better and better 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.650
 to feel 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 we are directly connected 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.610
 of course 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.950
 so it returns you diet for 14 year olds 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.740
 no i would really wait until you get a little older 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.810
 that you can go more specific 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.929
 select from which nutrients you 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.570
 more and building materials 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.120
 micronutrients you can go to choose 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.290
 to achieve certain goals 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.000
 for the people who totally do not know where 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.500
 it's about watch my videos again 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.209
 about Kate to keep the principle once 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.610
 that you eat very few carbohydrates 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.989
 lots of proteins and fats you actually become 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.150
 primary fuel and you build 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.160
 body on a meadow with the bar 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.959
 switching could not condition you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.880
 body to use fat as a primary 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.760
 fuel instead of carbohydrates 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.350
 quite a big change so no 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.300
 at 14 years it just nice what the pot 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.180
 proceeds him 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.100
 putting father and mother on the table enjoys 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.750
 just believe me about that 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.780
 number of years are your own potty and you 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.880
 own ditjes and datjes must arrange well 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.980
 I still just sit have dinner 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.200
 therefore lasts and makes you active 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.000
 afraid that you will train that you 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.290
 uncle my path is just a block every day 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.100
 for walking 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.080
 tries to start with 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.880
 push abdominal exercises and the bowl 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.960
 you naturally a century 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.640
 so 14 year old no boiler 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.740
 if your me also not to name you are 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
 to see if you want to go who you have 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.740
 I all over with your parents the doctor 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.690
 for the dietitian 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.280
 therefore just try to be active 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.959
 to be 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.959
 and then everything will be fine 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.740
 well des vennes to words times
