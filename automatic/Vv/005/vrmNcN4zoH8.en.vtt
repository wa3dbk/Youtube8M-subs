00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 enough happens to baby too 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.350
 interesting such events in the baby 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.050
 coordination begins to increase 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.099
 hands I have these now chaotic sweeps 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 hands and feet 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.350
 which may be already feeling the mom they 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.930
 begin to be purged by the brain of the baby 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 starts to reach out there 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.270
 wants if he wants to hit the mouse 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 stomach 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.170
 then he often begins 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.670
 get here to the second end of the second 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 trimester it starts getting already 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.810
 well enough almost any 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.940
 the movement that you feel the end 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.760
 second trimester she has goals 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.129
 directed ie kids 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 somehow manifest your emotions and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 Alyonushka beats the pen where he wants 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.280
 get into this period the baby starts 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 open your mouth and start building 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.170
 grimaces this is also a moment of connection 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.609
 muscle activity of the cerebral cortex then 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.770
 there he starts doing what he wants 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.199
 and of course one of the most global 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.630
 event baby begins to distinguish sounds 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 that is, little by little more and more clear 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
 become his hearing is one of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.430
 first analyzers that start 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.729
 work with a baby and already absolutely 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 generally accepted scientifically proven that 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.549
 baby distinguish intonation and well 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.509
 hears the events that occur during 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.270
 external environment 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 through the water space through 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.439
 tummy anna surface i mean he 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 naturally can't discern the meaning 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.659
 said but he absolutely distinguish 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.799
 intonation is said means click away 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.700
 some kind of sweet purr with him and 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.340
 talk to your baby is enough 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 useful later will find out 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.970
 intonation and often mom who 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.799
 pregnant with the second third baby 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.920
 note that babies respond well to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.159
 touches 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.409
 dad's letters and words peacefully love 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.710
 older brother or sisters of this 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.330
 the set is also already very famous stuff 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.270
 what happens next with march this 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.420
 period of time to you and continues 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.060
 increase appetite therefore all more 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.800
 some moments become actual 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.930
 associated with weight gain 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.150
 it is clear that no one will be for it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 scold put on a diet now it's already 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.290
 old grandma's chest nobody we're not 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.130
 planted on apple diets for any 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.140
 others but of course if you are typing 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.769
 together only limit yourself 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.630
 I need and I generally recommend the general 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.730
 attend a nutrition lecture because 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.160
 however much I want to tell you everything about 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.870
 today I can not exactly about this aspect 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.060
 and there we have a lot of all sorts of nuances 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.090
 cassette all three trimesters 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 on food vodka continue to increasingly 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.980
 grow in the second trimester occurs 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 growth begins abruptly and occurs 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 intensive uterine growth a due to growth 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.980
 fetus as I already told others 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.260
 may notice your tummy 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.840
 second in the second trimester you should 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.500
 already think about under will be inexpensive 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 bandage to help unload 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.280
 your spine and pelvic bones in order 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.660
 to minimize the load in order 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.480
 to allow the spine to rest 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.859
 because the third trimester 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.720
 Kostya’s hand spine, too 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.609
 strong enough load and also 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.750
 second trimester may begin to appear 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.239
 heartburn heartburn inevitable accompaniment 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.220
 someone's pregnancy is just more u 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.019
 someone less such as 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390
 minimize this here this bad 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.209
 phenomena we firstly you need to eat 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.250
 small portions naturally need from 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.819
 ration clean those products that 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.299
 cause heartburn is citrus then apples 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:58.000
 these are products that are rich in you 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.280
 these are definitely fried foods in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.870
 Basically, disciples 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.400
 food because they are very rich 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.750
 kilocalories is absolutely proven that 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.060
 It produces carcinogenic despite not 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.270
 regardless of what and how you fried 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.940
 product fried them always more when 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.290
 This benefit from the fried product is much 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.299
 less than the product which 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.400
 cooked for about a couple or 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:28.889
 extinguished in order to minimize 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.830
 heartburn again return up to this 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.240
 question you need to soak up with small 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.460
 portions and fractional 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.010
 that is, let it be not three times a day 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.930
 meals five to six meals a day for 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.090
 account of this you will overflow live 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.780
 so you will be thrown content 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.300
 food 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.770
 what's own cause heartburn we 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.940
 must remember that if in the second 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.250
 trimester heartburn be observed slightly 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.040
 infrequently and after every meal it 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.800
 in the third trimester this symptoms will 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.560
 harder so start to teach your 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.310
 the organism itself is already in the second 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.410
 antiquity baby starts a little 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.500
 baby's skin begins to change 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.650
 coat with original lubricant 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.450
 original lubricant she is familiar for sure 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.210
 many of you have seen videos by birth 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.460
 baby so here it is thick white 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.940
 the lubricant of this is the one 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.410
 original lubricant it consists of 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.620
 Sebum with flake 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.990
 play the fool is very important 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.940
 function in utero i.e. not in vain 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.380
 not formed before birth in the second 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.030
 trimester i.e. this is protection 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.729
 antibacterial baby is protection from 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.780
 frequent long stay in 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.820
 water because it is inevitable later 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.570
 this grease will help pass 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.460
 baby through the birth canal on the uvula 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.130
 baby begins to form taste 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.530
 nipples so if he swallows 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.569
 amniotic fluid is sometimes 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.369
 sometimes a baby can distinguish its taste 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.899
 the organ of touch continues to evolve 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:11.209
 baby in this trimester when you will 

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:13.309
 on ultrasound, pregnant women can often 

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:15.469
 watch your baby suck your thumb 

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:17.629
 that is, you can capture it now and 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.610
 on video and on photo 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:22.159
 that is, here it is one of the first 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.499
 reflexes that appear and often 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.539
 babies of taste childbirth and regina passes 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.729
 they suck or pacifier or thumb 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.919
 if especially if you get breasts for 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.550
 cops because u need to satisfy 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.559
 your sucking reflex is physiology 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.930
 we understand that the end of the second trimester 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:40.789
 marked by the fact that now not only you 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.740

 touching or hitting baby’s feet 

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.709
 from the inside you can offer Russian 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.439
 listen you can have a hand in all this 

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:59.360
