00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 hello friends today one more time here to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.830
 show you one more tip for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.289
 who has a small pool for those who 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 has a small joinery and likes 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.199
 feeding is always a little something not 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 necessarily half because I 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 I will show you today is very old would this 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.920
 fits the accordion head flame 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.620
 Look, I have a passion for this path. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 I love this chapter we already have many 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.390
 these paths fanfold the secret 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 his is close indicate site right 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.600
 that there is right that the person in Brazil 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.280
 that ultimately will stay here 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.329
 square or not a little bit 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 open flame becomes wine and litter 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.340
 in colonial times I did this 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.970
 here from above with 10 centimeters of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.670
 length only the team not counting 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.090
 explains the middle I already counted on eight 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.070
 and another low with 6 for 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.990
 stay a distance 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 after him, do not hang everything 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 equal 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 And look how it looks more beautiful. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.830
 aesthetically looks very beautiful if you do 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.070
 in what size make two cylinders 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.840
 difference is already great 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.439
 how to start this path 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 I got a lot here because I'm going 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.759
 do not know what to do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.610
 and I'll do 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.619
 first I cut a piece and woman of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.780
 9 millimeters 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.750
 I cut with who we feel wide and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.170
 32 inches in length 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.229
 this show that counts a little short 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.619
 then making him 35 centimeters 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.719
 of lenght 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.930
 as I said the secret is laying a 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.860
 on the other if you do the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.870
 the wrong way or the drilling has 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.099
 wrong because she's only in the center 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.260
 ah you too may be regretting 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.659
 not only with two cases you can 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.420
 also increase the quantity 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.120
 in the case of the two little shakes in 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 side you back putting 2 large and 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.269
 Stretching more it will stay with 10 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.319
 lollipops so okay if you want to 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.849
 increase 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.690
 just put two big here and well 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.060
 but to p 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 I'll make another bigger gap another 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.579
 video for you is but this size of 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.540
 a good size so the drilling does not have 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:55.590
 how to go wrong because it's a hole in 101 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.209
 and that is at the tip will mark the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.079
 width of the material and make the 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.959
 curve then is that sense it 45 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:12.390
 down and risking 4 cents and doing 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:17.970
 holes for the last 10 small ears 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:21.720
 I already was already positioned in the 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:25.319
 side and put the final 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.950
 so I have the center set up and I have 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.819
 the two mounted sides of our 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.120
 sides mounted and center mounted 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.120
 fit into this part 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.879
 the sides 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:51.800
 So you try to put it in the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.000
 seven holes oh you will do the test see 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.360
 if it is closing O it will close 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.120
 What's the drink, this little one? 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:14.060
 The small measure you 'll discover is 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:16.250
 that hole is exactly that 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.940
 large does not matter the fulfillment of this 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:25.550
 big the small side for incredible 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.390
 that looks like this is the half is of sicuro 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.500
 in this future 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.280
 this is 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:41.700
 this is the countenance to take two holes or 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.970
 little one who is the pur of the great 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.070
 then it will close me perfectly 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.090
 I knew it but I heard it is now 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.090
 very easy very easy even with base 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.670
 you measure and do a little to the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.490
 then the first is done in the 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:03.360
 big head do not worry about 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.669
 small one that will give site enough you 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.690
 copy this course said furlan 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:12.120
 There is no way they do not receive 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.790
 and you will have very beautiful hair 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.100
 Yesterday I posted the video of how I did it. 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.440

 I was doing there 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:37.880
 I also survive the spike a little 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.820
 more loose for those who do not get tight 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:45.050

 the captain formed very handsome I used 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.210
 then the wood of four centimeters 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:11.540
 width by a feeling of thickness 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:15.960
 is the fulfillment of this greater 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.010
