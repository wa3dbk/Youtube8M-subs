00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.690
 Hello limited stuff is weak Anthony 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:15.639
 Though it is the record store day which the whole also explained 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.620
 Again, this is Sunday, April 18 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:23.350
 It is already this weekend 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:29.610
 I think that I will be called that discount sale in the recorder who is on duty but I 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:33.930
 After all it is limited and advanced to be released for this day 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.970
 I don't know how many years ago this was but this zara 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.060
 of people who say mcfarlane 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 I bought a tiny record that N Mohd spree 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.970
 Then last year is here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.860
 With Danny Hathaway's live at the bitter end 1971 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.760
 I bought a record to say 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:02.230
 This is really good to buy 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.850
 It is limited to 4,000 sheets in the world, but the jacket is good, the sound is good and the contents are good. 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.720
 Without saying 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.470
 It is L'Ecole 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.860
 You can make like a video I bought this from just finished rsd like a last year 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 If everyone's is it's also an already too late and wished good this 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.000
 It will be sold out soon, so this year is a little in advance 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.710
 What kind of thing is limited release 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.680
 I want to check with you a little 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.940
 Hmm 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.690
 Yes This is the official site of rsd Japan 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.690
 Although only what is released in Japan is listed here 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:02:01.710
 I am proud of my work 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 In the video I will sing in my personal taste but the highlight of the year is 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:10.350
 What 's the price ? This is Sakamoto Ryuichi's 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:16.800
 the best of playing the orchestra 2014 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.270
 There is thing of lp 3 piece set very high with 10,000 yen saying, but this is something 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.290
 It may be a good deal 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.680
 I was watching this page carefully on the deck 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 It Well 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.100
 I went to near the bottom 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.900
 this 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:42.540
 It's this, it's something like a bad smell that's going on 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.470
 In some genres, it's a rare groove, or jazz rock 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:50.250
 I wonder 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:56.890
 Me Naku' know this remote place entirely all due respect I who say this Jiro Inagaki is what kind of person 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:00.819
 The one also are reading these sentences but I do not know at all and what serves as vivid kun 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.880
 There was a sound source when I searched on youtube 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:10.360
 If you ask this, this is it 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:16.880
 I sound can be seen it is the Tteyuu looks good just to look at me in video parentheses well 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:20.470
 Though this is high with 41,167 yen and so-so but 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.020
 This is I think that I should go to buy 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:29.800
 You will also be concerned about things that will be released overseas in a row 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.660
 Please check Inion's homepage 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:39.420
 There is rsd here though 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.540
 Like this, every genre or so is arranged in full alphabetical order 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.710
 But I love jazz 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:49.960
 I would like to 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.200
 Although I explained it one year ago, this rsd gives priority to store sales 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.590
 Because 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.220
 Even if you make a reservation here, it may not be available 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:04.250
 I can not but believe this buyer's power already 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:08.600
 The reservation on the homepage is from 10 am on April 18 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.430
 Check without turning and check a favorite piece 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.840
 Seeing this jazz page at- 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:21.789
 -Out this is by cassandra wilson This enthusiasm other day Blue Note 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.480
 I'd wanted to go Truly I'm Tan still have not seen even once is unfortunately raw 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.980
 Right 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 The cover of this album is something just recently released 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.169
 I already bought a cd though 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:41.030
 It is a tribute album to Billy Holiday 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:42.169
 This interesting thing is to look at the song It is easy to understand if you look at this 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.639
 Yes 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:50.509
 And Cassandra Wilson sings on one side 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:55.129
 Head and the mood that im in before called fusion 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:58.669
 I'm back, but Billy Holiday sings 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:02.160
 The same say the word hate and the mood that i am in 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:07.320
 So what age the same song 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:13.950
 I think that it is a very wonderful project I say that compilation over 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:18.420
 In This is probably but I think well of as a collection item wonderful 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:22.150
 I am already listening to these two songs already 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:26.380
 So unfortunately my song a little bit 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.510
 It is not so I think I will pass this time 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.870
 I think it is good as a collection item 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:39.680
 I was worried about one more 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:44.760
 It is here Thelonious thing that Monk seat London Collection vol 2 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:51.420
 Well this is limited to 2000 worldwide 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.830
 Well I think this will soon be sold out I heard the Thelonious Monk still properly 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.810
 Without it 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:01.200
 Well hey I'm I'll try kana bought for study it a little more investigate this 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.280
 The London Collection has volume one two three 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.750
 Like 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.150
 1 is piano solow 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.880
 This vol 2 seems to be a piano trio 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.280
 8 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.940
 Monk's Final Recording Session As is a Band Leader 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.420
 From 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:32.289
 Well, my own leader's work is the recording of the last recording session 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:36.310
 The end of the book there is Mac Kibon there is a ne in bassist would do a thing say 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:40.880
 It is a drummer Art Blakey in gunna business 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:44.630
 Well this may be a battle for a while- 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.940
