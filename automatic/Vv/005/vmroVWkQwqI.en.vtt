00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
think the all-around gun it's great gun

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
think the all-around gun it's great gun
to<00:01:11.009> use<00:01:11.160> some<00:01:11.880> people<00:01:12.180> don't<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.750> some

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to use some people don't like it some

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.850 
to use some people don't like it some
people<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.649> um<00:01:14.990> what<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> best

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
people do um what I think is the best

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
people do um what I think is the best
with<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.190> gun<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.700> red<00:01:17.880> dot<00:01:18.770> just

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
with this gun is the red dot just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.580 
with this gun is the red dot just
because<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.850> red<00:01:21.060> dot<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.270> kick<00:01:21.630> cuz<00:01:22.049> kick

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
because what red dot and kick cuz kick

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.930 
because what red dot and kick cuz kick
is<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:22.979> important<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.549> gun<00:01:23.760> because

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
is very important for this gun because

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.180 
is very important for this gun because
it<00:01:24.090> has<00:01:24.240> has<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.350> bit<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> recoil<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
it has has a little bit of recoil that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.640 
it has has a little bit of recoil that
can<00:01:26.340> throw<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.670> off<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.960> i<00:01:27.990> highly<00:01:28.500> suggest

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
can throw you off so i highly suggest

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.820 
can throw you off so i highly suggest
using<00:01:29.280> kik<00:01:29.760> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.140> use<00:01:31.320> qik<00:01:31.619> it's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
using kik if you don't use qik it's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.980 
using kik if you don't use qik it's
going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.159> bouncing<00:01:32.610> around<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.780> might

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
going to be bouncing around you it might

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
going to be bouncing around you it might
take<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.860> take<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.400> longer<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
take you it's gonna take you longer to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929 
take you it's gonna take you longer to
kill<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> person<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:38.220> pretty<00:01:38.670> sure<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
kill the person so I'm pretty sure you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
kill them on the iron sights I think are

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.080 
kill them on the iron sights I think are
not<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.630> great<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.520> modern<00:01:47.939> warfare

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
not that great I like the modern warfare

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.499 
not that great I like the modern warfare
two<00:01:48.450> iron<00:01:48.780> sights<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:49.320> better<00:01:50.060> that's<00:01:51.060> just

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
two iron sights a lot better that's just

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.380 
two iron sights a lot better that's just
personal<00:01:52.020> preference<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:54.240> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
personal preference I'm because for some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
personal preference I'm because for some
reason<00:01:54.500> these<00:01:55.500> iron<00:01:55.860> sights<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.400> remind

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
reason these iron sights kind of remind

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.240 
reason these iron sights kind of remind
me<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> famas<00:01:57.360> iron<00:01:57.570> sights<00:01:57.900> for<00:01:58.170> mw2<00:01:58.950> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
me of the famas iron sights for mw2 I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.170 
me of the famas iron sights for mw2 I
didn't<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
didn't really like them so but it's a it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.140 
didn't really like them so but it's a it
works<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.900> guess<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.530> long<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.490> long<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
works I guess as long as long as you

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.479 
works I guess as long as long as you
have<00:02:06.329> cake<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.780> can't<00:02:07.020> stress<00:02:07.380> using<00:02:08.220> cake

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
have cake I can't stress using cake

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
annoying but hey you know I can use to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.260 
annoying but hey you know I can use to
my<00:02:33.630> advantage<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.170> use<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.680> gun<00:02:34.890> too<00:02:35.270> but

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
my advantage I can use this gun too but

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.960 
my advantage I can use this gun too but
you<00:02:36.570> gotta<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.050> know<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.350> used<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.970> all

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
you gotta really know it's used that all

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.400 
you gotta really know it's used that all
those<00:02:39.270> people<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.600> play<00:02:39.840> search<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
those people that play search and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.610 
those people that play search and
destroy<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.810> getting<00:02:43.050> on<00:02:43.170> big<00:02:43.380> kill

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620

streaks<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.070> stuff<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:45.090> highly<00:02:45.450> suggest

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
streaks and stuff I would highly suggest

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.210 
streaks and stuff I would highly suggest
using<00:02:46.580> kik<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.790> silencer<00:02:48.270> because<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> mean

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
using kik and silencer because I mean

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.370 
using kik and silencer because I mean
you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.310> get<00:02:50.490> used<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.910> iron<00:02:51.060> sights

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
you can get used to the iron sights

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.860 
you can get used to the iron sights
obviously<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.640> long<00:02:53.640> as<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.450> kick

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
obviously as long as you have the kick

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.890 
obviously as long as you have the kick
in<00:02:55.170> silencer<00:02:55.740> because<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.820> won't<00:02:57.030> bump<00:02:57.420> like

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
in silencer because it won't bump like

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
in silencer because it won't bump like
jump<00:02:58.530> around<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.980> lot<00:02:59.160> it'll<00:02:59.370> still<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.790> its

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
jump around a lot it'll still have its

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.720 
jump around a lot it'll still have its
strength<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.140> it'll<00:03:01.380> be<00:03:01.410> silent<00:03:02.250> at<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.550> same

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
strength but it'll be silent at the same

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.940 
strength but it'll be silent at the same
time<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.870> would<00:03:04.020> be<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.200> good<00:03:04.440> gun<00:03:04.680> for

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
time so that would be a good gun for

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.580 
time so that would be a good gun for
search<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.490> think<00:03:05.820> I've<00:03:06.540> seen<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.990> in<00:03:07.020> search<00:03:07.230> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
search I think I've seen it in search so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.780 
search I think I've seen it in search so
I<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:09.230> suggest<00:03:10.230> using<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.650> if<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:10.950> want<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.340> do

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
I I suggest using it if you want to do

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.720 
I I suggest using it if you want to do
well<00:03:12.350> um<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:15.180> gun<00:03:15.390> works<00:03:16.190> pretty<00:03:17.190> much<00:03:17.310> for

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
well um this gun works pretty much for

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.550 
well um this gun works pretty much for
anything<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.810> said<00:03:19.020> the<00:03:19.200> up-close

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
anything like I said the up-close

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.360 
anything like I said the up-close
personal<00:03:20.030> stuff<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.110> things<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.340> only

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
personal stuff but the things I the only

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.640 
personal stuff but the things I the only
things<00:03:24.300> I<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:24.780> find<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.500> not

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
things I can really find that are not

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.060 
things I can really find that are not
that<00:03:25.860> greater<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:27.450> me<00:03:27.630> again<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.560> iron<00:03:28.800> sights

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
that greater to me again the iron sights

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.240 
that greater to me again the iron sights
and<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:30.330> recoil<00:03:31.050> how<00:03:31.650> jumpy<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:34.220> when<00:03:35.220> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and the recoil how jumpy it is I when I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.100 
and the recoil how jumpy it is I when I
first<00:03:35.310> got<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.480> know<00:03:36.600> you<00:03:36.660> didn't<00:03:37.050> have

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
first got it you know you didn't have

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.920 
first got it you know you didn't have
any<00:03:37.290> attachments<00:03:38.160> or<00:03:38.220> anything<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:39.450> was<00:03:39.660> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
any attachments or anything it was a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.870 
any attachments or anything it was a
little<00:03:40.260> bit<00:03:40.470> harder<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.010> get<00:03:41.100> those<00:03:41.310> first<00:03:41.670> few

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
little bit harder to get those first few

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.920 
little bit harder to get those first few
kills<00:03:42.540> without<00:03:43.530> anything<00:03:44.330> but<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.480> mean<00:03:45.720> just

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
kills without anything but I mean just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.530 
kills without anything but I mean just
just<00:03:46.290> watch<00:03:46.470> this<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.970> look<00:03:48.090> at<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.209> you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
just watch this just look at that you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.150 
just watch this just look at that you
got<00:03:48.959> those<00:03:49.140> kills<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.530> didn't<00:03:49.800> hit<00:03:49.890> him<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
got those kills I didn't hit him in the

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.860 
got those kills I didn't hit him in the
first<00:03:50.340> part<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.730> them<00:03:50.850> when<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> hit<00:03:51.120> him<00:03:51.239> yup

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
first part in them when I hit him yup

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.070 
first part in them when I hit him yup
see<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.160> such<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> strong

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
see that it's just so it's such a strong

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.020 
see that it's just so it's such a strong
fast<00:03:55.080> killing<00:03:55.590> gun<00:03:55.800> that<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.280> don't<00:03:56.700> see<00:03:56.880> why

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
fast killing gun that I don't see why

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.060 
fast killing gun that I don't see why
you<00:03:57.090> wouldn't<00:03:57.360> want<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.660> use<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:57.989> gun<00:03:58.230> and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
you wouldn't want to use this gun and

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.390 
you wouldn't want to use this gun and
get<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.459> killstreak<00:03:59.850> easily<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:01.400> would

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
get you on a killstreak easily I would

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.070 
get you on a killstreak easily I would
use<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.790> salt<00:04:03.090> kill<00:04:03.300> streak<00:04:03.570> with<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.870> gun

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
use the salt kill streak with this gun

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.410 
use the salt kill streak with this gun
because<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:05.580> easily<00:04:05.880> get<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> kill

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
because it you can easily get on a kill

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.270 
because it you can easily get on a kill
streak<00:04:06.540> with<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.110> but<00:04:07.860> unless<00:04:08.100> you're

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
