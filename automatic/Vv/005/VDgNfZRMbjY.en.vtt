00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 for many people is the baltic sea 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.299
 anomaly only a natural origin 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.189
 plate but the scientists the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.830
 This anomaly has been studied and tested 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.349
 have some samples of the object 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 and have confirmed that the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.670
 anomaly a metallic one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.500
 has composition and at least 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.510
 14,000 years old is another 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.490
 Investigations lead us to two 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.439
 notable new views on june 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 1977 during a routine test flight over 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.030
 the baltic sea of ​​a swedish air force 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.510
 This pilot witnessed an UFO 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.790
 sighting and 1982 had a Polish 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.760
 fischer also a ufo sighting 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.590
 experienced both cars were reported and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 in the nearness to see slash 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 I have to cross the Baltic Sea 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 anomaly 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 The Baltic Sea anomaly a 14,000 years 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 old spaceship fourth june 2014 the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.800
 is not an object from the modern times and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.199
 people made whatever that is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.000
 that dates from the ice age or even the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.270
 peter lindberg said on 24 february 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 2013 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.260
 The property is older than 14,000 years 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 even older than the straight edge 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 exact angles rounded edges 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.130
 sort of like a plate and of the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 base underneath the media and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.330
 there is hardly anything left to science 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 Guess because if you look at what 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 because of the innocent baltic sea 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 one finds hardly an expression of the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.280
 that can describe 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.979
 there are three objects 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.330
 the main object is circular and 60 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.150
 meter in diameter 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 then there is a smaller structure that about 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.979
 200 meters far from the main object on the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.110
 Meeresgrund can be found and also 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.020
 not after a natural origin 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.080
 looks like and the third structure is one 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.649
 round window plans of 28 meters height 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.649
 and 275 meters wide with a deep 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.500
 crack was discovered the whole plant of 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.679
 a recovery company swedish diver 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.899
 The delete explora team came across 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.600
 by chance on this most interesting 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.030
 anomalies the divers had left 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.459
 around on the seabed at the hotel 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.739
 to look for something to appreciate 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.780
 the committees come from and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.880
 forget lying in the seabed and for 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.250
 the discoverers are quite profitable 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.140
 It was very specific in search of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.959
 sunken warships with one 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.239
 tons of silver charge suddenly 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.100
 appears on her son achim in 85 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.519
 meters deep a very unusual 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.709
 Structure a flat round disc with 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.739
 striking straight edges and corners of 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.799
 60 meters in diameter they dip immediately 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.380
 down to investigate the phenomenon 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.690
 the first guess it could be 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.549
 an only unusually shaped but 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.730
 of course , formations like acting 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.799
 turns out to be unsustainable as she is around it 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
 The fabric turns out to be swimming around 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.720
 as a rather pitts shaped object, for example 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.090
 raised four meters above the sea floor 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.890
 the edges of the screen are perfect 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.440
 rounded and on the surface 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.200
 oval hole that looks like an entrance 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.170
 also the structure of the top sees 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.060
 clearly artificially created from parts 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.989
 The surface are charcoal-like 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.420
 covered with soot 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.760
 the pils-like structure is at the end 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.160
 a long deep into the ground 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.079
 The train gave the impression of one 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.560
 very long brake track or one 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.780
 Runway is considering Peter Lindberg leader 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.299
 and founders of the recovery divers team 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.470
 say we do not know what we do 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.900
 have found 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.390
 everything we have at this time 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.510
 could determine the size and the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.090
 shape of the object and based on the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.129
 solar picture that an extremely long folk 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.040
 railway across the sea bottom to the 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.590
 circular anomaly leads or too 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.840
 stephan hollow out of this 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.090
 another diver of the team says 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.670
 during my 20-year-old dives 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.459
 career and 6000 dives I have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.580
 Never seen anything like normal stones 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.750
 Do not burn, I have no idea what 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.390
 we saw there 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 I dived into the depths of the baltic sea 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.769
 to find answers there 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.470
 instead, I dove with even more 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.090
 ask again somehow that will 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.049
 but hardly found in the media 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 treated 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.699
 there are even attempts to explain this 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.919
 everything was just a bit strange 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.620
 Stone formations passing through the glaciers 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.150
 By chance, ice age moves like this 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.130
 the rock were cut 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.419
 as this country still above the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.180
 sea ​​level 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.430
 but who looks at the pictures of the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.979
 can only say that is in the exactness 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.750
 inconceivable 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.580
 especially the exact cassettes-like 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.550
 Wells can not be achieved in this way 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.410
 Of course, a harder gesture can come 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.389
 in with the power of a meter high 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.600
 glacier attracted by soft gesture 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.580
 deep grooves and verchen cut that 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.710
 But then it does not suddenly become exact 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.660
 at right angles and the incisive 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.940
 object has completely disappeared and 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.990
 leaves an exact box-like 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.669
 excerpt what can it be sacred 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.449
 Stone Age place of worship one 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.660
 incredible mood of nature from gray 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.660
 prehistoric times
