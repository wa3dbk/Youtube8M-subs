00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
and then these are two pieces did you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.670 
and then these are two pieces did you
attach<00:01:41.780> leave<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.899> right<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.530> make

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
there's a peg system here all you do is

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.069 
there's a peg system here all you do is
just<00:02:02.850> line<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> attach<00:02:03.689> them<00:02:03.869> it's

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
just line it up and attach them it's

just line it up and attach them it's
really<00:02:04.350> simple<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.860> fact<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.640> peg<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
really simple in fact the peg is a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.389 
really simple in fact the peg is a
it's<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.750> shape<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:09.069> tell<00:02:09.250> you're

it's a shape so you can tell you're

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.710 
it's a shape so you can tell you're
getting<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.729> right<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.119> I'm<00:02:10.209> just<00:02:10.360> gonna<00:02:10.450> I

getting it right so I'm just gonna I
don't<00:02:10.929> want<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.170> undo<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> because<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.610> all<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
don't want to undo it because of all the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.660 
don't want to undo it because of all the
different<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.890> spikes<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:15.069> they<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.489> be<00:02:15.640> a

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
different like spikes here they can be a

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.040 
different like spikes here they can be a
little<00:02:15.819> flimsy<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.510> don't<00:02:16.750> want<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.930> break

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
little flimsy and I don't want to break

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.630 
little flimsy and I don't want to break
in<00:02:17.260> fact<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.560> one's<00:02:17.800> already<00:02:18.310> showing<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
in fact this one's already showing a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.250 
in fact this one's already showing a
little<00:02:18.700> bit<00:02:18.910> stress<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.630> don't<00:02:19.959> want<00:02:20.140> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
little bit stress so I don't want to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.979 
little bit stress so I don't want to
mess<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.900> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
mess with that but so we're going to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.750 
mess with that but so we're going to
show<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.380> off<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.770> minute<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.670> get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
show that off in a minute but you get

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.920 
show that off in a minute but you get
the<00:02:24.819> idea<00:02:24.940> there<00:02:25.239> three<00:02:25.390> pieces<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.810> can

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
the idea there three pieces and you can

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.449 
the idea there three pieces and you can
bind<00:02:26.020> them<00:02:26.140> together<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.650> don't<00:02:27.190> want<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> have

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
bind them together I don't want to have

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.940 
bind them together I don't want to have
another<00:02:27.489> live<00:02:27.819> figure<00:02:28.180> after<00:02:28.270> breaking<00:02:28.950> so

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
another live figure after breaking so

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.930 
another live figure after breaking so
I'm<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.130> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.310> zoom<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.670> little<00:02:30.790> bit

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.750 
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit
so<00:02:31.270> here<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.510> have<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:32.080> figure<00:02:32.470> itself

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
so here we have the figure itself

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
so here we have the figure itself
checking<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.880> sculpt<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.450> think<00:02:34.600> they<00:02:34.660> did

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
checking out the sculpt I think they did

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780 
checking out the sculpt I think they did
a<00:02:34.840> pretty<00:02:35.050> good<00:02:35.230> job<00:02:35.290> on<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.800> those<00:02:36.370> helmets

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
a pretty good job on it those helmets

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.600 
a pretty good job on it those helmets
rather<00:02:37.120> well<00:02:37.390> done<00:02:38.250> obviously<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.400> being

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
rather well done obviously this being

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.220 
rather well done obviously this being
the<00:02:39.670> older<00:02:39.910> styles<00:02:40.300> their<00:02:40.810> helmets<00:02:41.080> weren't

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the older styles their helmets weren't

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.630 
the older styles their helmets weren't
as<00:02:41.290> fancy<00:02:41.620> as<00:02:41.650> they<00:02:41.860> were<00:02:41.920> but<00:02:42.220> they<00:02:42.250> capture

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
as fancy as they were but they capture

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.580 
as fancy as they were but they capture
that<00:02:42.760> pretty<00:02:43.030> well<00:02:43.239> with<00:02:43.930> his<00:02:44.140> green<00:02:44.440> eyes

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that pretty well with his green eyes

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.470 
that pretty well with his green eyes
with<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> bunch<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.220> little<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.850> know<00:02:45.970> dots<00:02:46.239> in

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
with a bunch of little you know dots in

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.990 
with a bunch of little you know dots in
it<00:02:46.769> or<00:02:47.769> we<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:47.980> see<00:02:48.160> before<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.550> compound

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it or we can see before that compound

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.150 
it or we can see before that compound
eyes<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.269> they<00:02:49.300> did<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.690> pretty<00:02:49.900> well<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
eyes so they did that pretty well the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.040 
eyes so they did that pretty well the
antennas<00:02:51.700> here<00:02:51.910> also<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> really<00:02:52.750> nice

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
antennas here also have a really nice

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.850 
antennas here also have a really nice
paint<00:02:53.470> job<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.709> them<00:02:54.069> with<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.180> sort<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.860> lack

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
paint job on them with this sort of lack

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.830 
paint job on them with this sort of lack
of<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.040> better<00:02:57.069> word<00:02:57.250> worn<00:02:57.730> look<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:58.510> red

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
of a better word worn look it's like red

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.479 
of a better word worn look it's like red
and<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.560> you've<00:02:59.709> got<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.069> these<00:03:00.250> little

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
and then you've got like these little

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.370 
and then you've got like these little
greenish<00:03:01.180> speckles<00:03:01.780> throughout<00:03:01.989> him<00:03:02.140> and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
greenish speckles throughout him and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.720 
greenish speckles throughout him and
they<00:03:02.530> do<00:03:02.590> really<00:03:02.799> good<00:03:03.010> job<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> representing

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
they do really good job of representing

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.150 
they do really good job of representing
that<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:05.230> they<00:03:05.350> got<00:03:05.500> their<00:03:05.620> portions<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.069> his

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
that and they got their portions on his

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.500 
that and they got their portions on his
head<00:03:06.310> right<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.910> overall<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.330> did<00:03:07.450> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
head right to so the overall just did a

articulation is hindered slightly by

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.800 
articulation is hindered slightly by
this<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:43.890> not<00:04:43.980> very<00:04:44.280> much<00:04:44.580> because<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.690> gives

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
this but not very much because it gives

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.500 
this but not very much because it gives
pretty<00:04:46.080> good<00:04:46.170> leeway<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.970> do<00:04:48.060> have<00:04:48.150> swiveling

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
pretty good leeway you do have swiveling

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.590 
pretty good leeway you do have swiveling
lsr<00:04:48.810> till<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:49.200> damn<00:04:49.350> kneecap<00:04:49.770> cheese<00:04:50.600> double

knee joint here swiveling hang out the
foot<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.270> then<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.480> have<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.840> bendito

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
foot and then you have the bendito

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.440 
foot and then you have the bendito
action<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:55.920> standard<00:04:56.220> articulation<00:04:56.850> i<00:04:57.060> think

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
action so standard articulation i think

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.760 
action so standard articulation i think
is<00:04:57.540> pretty<00:04:57.630> much<00:04:57.780> using<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.140> ichigo<00:04:58.440> v<00:04:58.590> three
