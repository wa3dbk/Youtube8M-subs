00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
like it's not really a big deal it is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.400 
like it's not really a big deal it is
actually<00:00:37.219> legal<00:00:37.989> mainly<00:00:38.989> due<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:39.140> security

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
actually legal mainly due to security

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.829 
actually legal mainly due to security
reasons<00:00:39.890> on<00:00:40.040> also<00:00:40.309> because<00:00:40.489> happy<00:00:41.480> birthday

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
is actually patent so you cannot

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.459 
is actually patent so you cannot
actually<00:00:44.030> have<00:00:44.570> someone's<00:00:44.929> birthday<00:00:45.170> in

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
public or post up the video about it

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.329 
public or post up the video about it
even<00:00:47.749> though<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:48.140> really<00:00:48.379> do<00:00:48.829> most<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.219> the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
even though you really do most of the

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.329 
even though you really do most of the
time<00:00:50.859> number<00:00:51.859> 9

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
time number 9

underage<00:00:52.760> Facebook<00:00:53.359> accounts<00:00:53.870> um<00:00:54.559> obviously

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
underage Facebook accounts um obviously

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.310 
underage Facebook accounts um obviously
many<00:00:56.089> people<00:00:56.420> can<00:00:56.570> probably<00:00:56.749> assume<00:00:56.929> why<00:00:57.260> this

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
many people can probably assume why this

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.639 
many people can probably assume why this
is<00:00:57.620> illegal<00:00:58.339> because<00:00:58.989> they've<00:00:59.989> set<00:01:00.289> a<00:01:00.440> limit

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
is illegal because they've set a limit

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.009 
is illegal because they've set a limit
and<00:01:01.010> there's<00:01:01.370> very<00:01:02.030> good<00:01:02.300> reasons<00:01:02.690> for<00:01:02.899> why

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
and there's very good reasons for why

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.960 
and there's very good reasons for why
they<00:01:03.260> have<00:01:03.469> age<00:01:03.679> limits<00:01:04.100> even<00:01:04.400> though<00:01:04.519> most<00:01:04.760> of

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
they have age limits even though most of

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.060 
they have age limits even though most of
us<00:01:05.059> probably<00:01:05.239> broke<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.830> when<00:01:06.830> Facebook

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
us probably broke that when Facebook

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.380 
us probably broke that when Facebook
came<00:01:07.400> out<00:01:08.110> number<00:01:09.110> 8<00:01:09.470> using<00:01:09.830> VPN<00:01:10.460> services<00:01:11.060> now
