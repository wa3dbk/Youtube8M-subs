 napkin with a logo slice 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.780
 let's take a closer look at the glasses 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.130
 provides for several types 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.610
 fit to face other glasses and such 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.140
 did not meet this connection by type 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.150
 masks at what the difference from the launch of narrow 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.570
 points where a similar type is used 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.549
 there is a good fit without flare 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:58.860
 not even on large faces if uncomfortable 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.540
 fit rubber foam 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.390
 gaskets that were included they 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.820
 just put here on this mask and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:18.600
 adjacent foam can be removed and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.600
 use the pinch- type fit 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.569
 With the help of such overlays, glasses have 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.879
 two embedded 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.000
 receiver at a frequency of 5 80 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.480
 sensitivity of 90 decibels working 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.519
 in diversity mode front camera 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.519
 640 by 480 resolution 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.060
 adjustable pupillary distance 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:56.380
 when power is also not in the same glasses 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.410
 I have not seen such a noise 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.540
 fan not annoying but he's there 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:08.860
 eat and cool apparently microcircuit 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.209
 further powered from two to six with input 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.160
 ppm is important though the tracker in these glasses is not 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.540
 built in but papin's entrance for what 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.139
 these points are used 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.289
 support picture in picture function 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.950
 the picture from the front camera is displayed 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:31.990
 in the corner you can change the position you can 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.370
 change the size of this picture through the menu 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.440
 points and the ppm entry serves just as 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.600
 here to get with the equipment 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.450
 three-way switch for example 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:49.060
 you can choose picture modes either 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:51.610
 it will only be from the receiver well, either 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.410
 The entry itself is a picture or it will be 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.180
 picture-in-picture mode 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:01.300
 either it will be a picture only mode with 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.610
 external camera can not hand 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.099
 points here it switches by 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.180
 buttons ok switch it from the remote with 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:20.080
 using your switch further 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:22.680
 hdmi input and input and you output and output 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.680
 headphone 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.060
 also here is an interesting feature in 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.639
 menu 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.180
 point unfortunately we can not it 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:40.060
 show because your exit is coming 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:45.340
 picture only with receivers at 5 8 and 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.560
 it displays no glasses menu no picture 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.889
 in the picture do not display only serves 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.849
 picture from the receivers but in the points menu we 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.840
 we can set thebat ti battery 2 3 4 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.210
 5 or 6 s in this case in the upper corner 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.819
 the right will show the state 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.409
 batteries 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:11.229
 how much it is charged also goes 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.780
 channel indication range indication 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:17.800
 channel change is very simple by pressing 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:21.580
 the buttons on the glasses I change 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.310
 range need to climb menu points 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:33.819
 and the output of the video input this moment is 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:36.840
 can be either a receiver or hdmi 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.840
