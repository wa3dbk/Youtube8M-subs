the two seconds to make it come on go

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
the two seconds to make it come on go
off<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.590> hit<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
off the hit on it will go like that and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
off the hit on it will go like that and
go<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.719> after<00:02:01.049> seven<00:02:01.409> degrees<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
go down the after seven degrees the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
go down the after seven degrees the
negative<00:02:02.130> seven<00:02:02.369> degrees<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.119> of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
negative seven degrees like a lot of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.090 
negative seven degrees like a lot of
these<00:02:03.270> do

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
these do

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.430 
these do
and<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.520> course<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.820> will<00:02:04.909> flip<00:02:05.150> around<00:02:05.450> 180

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
and of course it will flip around 180

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.040 
and of course it will flip around 180
that<00:02:06.710> way<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.880> they<00:02:08.030> leave<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.420> way<00:02:08.630> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
that way and they leave that way and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.150 
that way and they leave that way and
back<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.480> see<00:02:11.480> just<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.780> show<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
back and see just to show you just to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.210 
back and see just to show you just to
get<00:02:13.280> this<00:02:13.459> thing<00:02:13.730> back<00:02:14.150> up<00:02:14.800> that's<00:02:15.800> easy<00:02:16.010> it's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
get this thing back up that's easy it's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.220 
get this thing back up that's easy it's
easy<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.790> come<00:02:16.940> back<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.660> flip<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:17.990> back

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
easy to come back on so flip that back

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.980 
easy to come back on so flip that back
off<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.790> then<00:02:19.910> this<00:02:20.090> little<00:02:20.360> thing<00:02:20.570> here<00:02:20.600> just

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
off and then this little thing here just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.600 
off and then this little thing here just
keeps<00:02:21.200> coming<00:02:21.470> loose<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:24.110> covers<00:02:24.470> up<00:02:24.590> PC

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.790 

hookup<00:02:28.610> there<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.120> that's<00:02:29.390> uh<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:30.590> know<00:02:30.650> if

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
hookup there so that's uh you know if

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.110 
hookup there so that's uh you know if
you<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.010> see<00:02:31.130> that<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.430> there's<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.850> space

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
you can see that or not there's a space

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.790 
you can see that or not there's a space
there<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:33.230> very<00:02:33.320> very<00:02:33.620> hard

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
there and it's just it's very very hard

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.160 
there and it's just it's very very hard
to<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.100> hooked<00:02:35.060> up<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.600> last<00:02:35.810> thing<00:02:36.020> on

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
to get hooked up and the last thing on

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.990 
to get hooked up and the last thing on
this<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:37.250> he's<00:02:37.520> right<00:02:37.730> here

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
this and he's right here

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.360 
this and he's right here
it's<00:02:38.270> got<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.570> little<00:02:38.750> round<00:02:39.500> plastic<00:02:40.190> wheel

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
it's got this little round plastic wheel

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.370 
it's got this little round plastic wheel
or<00:02:41.180> you've<00:02:41.300> tightened<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.720> down<00:02:41.750> and<00:02:42.230> then<00:02:42.320> of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
or you've tightened it down and then of

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.690 
or you've tightened it down and then of
course<00:02:42.440> solution<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:42.950> taking<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.340> back<00:02:43.370> off

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
course solution I'm taking it back off

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.910 
course solution I'm taking it back off
pretty<00:02:44.540> cheap<00:02:44.840> but<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.350> know<00:02:45.470> ninety-nine

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
pretty cheap but you know ninety-nine

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.940 
pretty cheap but you know ninety-nine
dollars<00:02:45.950> again<00:02:46.489> what<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> expect<00:02:47.830> here<00:02:48.830> of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
dollars again what do you expect here of

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.350 
dollars again what do you expect here of
course<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.910> 430<00:02:50.360> e^x<00:02:50.870> -<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.060> if

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
course is the 430 e^x - and you know if

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.699 
course is the 430 e^x - and you know if
you<00:02:53.510> don't<00:02:53.690> invite<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.320> know<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> hit

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
you don't invite it you know the hit

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.290 
you don't invite it you know the hit
goes<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.610> take<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:55.970> around<00:02:56.180> this

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
goes like this and take it around this

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570 
goes like this and take it around this
way<00:02:56.360> only<00:02:56.600> goes<00:02:56.810> 90<00:02:57.050> degrees<00:02:57.440> if<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.280> go<00:02:58.400> this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
way only goes 90 degrees if you go this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.009 
way only goes 90 degrees if you go this
way<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.850> goes<00:02:58.940> 180<00:03:00.340> easier<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.489> handle<00:03:02.269> turn<00:03:02.900> it

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
way it goes 180 easier to handle turn it

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.080 
way it goes 180 easier to handle turn it
on<00:03:03.110> you<00:03:03.200> just<00:03:03.230> push<00:03:03.769> that<00:03:03.920> button<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.700> then

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
on you just push that button up and then

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.250 
on you just push that button up and then
you<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.330> hit<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.840> won't<00:03:05.989> see<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.230> light

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
you can hit that you won't see the light

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.080 
you can hit that you won't see the light
there<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:07.400> what<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.610> back<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.940> it<00:03:08.060> looks

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
there that's what the back of it looks

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.590 
there that's what the back of it looks
like<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.610> course<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.940> lock<00:03:11.120> on<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.450> is

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
like and of course the lock on it is

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.090 
like and of course the lock on it is
like<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.170> other<00:03:12.290> canisters<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:12.950> that

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
like all the other canisters just that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.949 
like all the other canisters just that
little<00:03:13.310> button<00:03:14.060> there's<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.269> lot<00:03:14.360> easier<00:03:14.810> of

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
little button there's a lot easier of

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.199 
little button there's a lot easier of
course<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.260> metal<00:03:15.500> foot<00:03:15.709> as<00:03:15.830> well<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:17.150> we

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
course the metal foot as well then we

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.949 
course the metal foot as well then we
move<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.570> 580<00:03:18.049> x2<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.239> right<00:03:20.480> here

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
move to the 580 x2 so it's right here

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.050 
move to the 580 x2 so it's right here
and<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.530> course<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:21.980> know<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.370> head<00:03:22.549> point<00:03:22.910> of

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
and of course you know the head point of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.479 
and of course you know the head point of
course<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.390> goes<00:03:23.510> 180<00:03:23.989> degrees<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.500> way<00:03:24.769> and

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
course it goes 180 degrees that way and

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.000 
course it goes 180 degrees that way and
on<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.610> degrees<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.000> way<00:03:26.420> very<00:03:27.230> easy<00:03:27.470> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
on the degrees that way very easy to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.759 
on the degrees that way very easy to
deal<00:03:28.220> with<00:03:28.250> as<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.450> can<00:03:29.600> see<00:03:29.810> metal<00:03:30.500> foot<00:03:30.650> of

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
deal with as you can see metal foot of

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.280 
deal with as you can see metal foot of
course<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.400> same<00:03:31.610> locking<00:03:31.970> mechanism<00:03:32.660> just

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
course the same locking mechanism just

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.960 
course the same locking mechanism just
turn<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:33.829> flip<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.310> let's<00:03:34.820> turn

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
turn it on just flip that let's turn

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.789 
turn it on just flip that let's turn
that<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.269> as<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.420> can<00:03:35.540> see<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.930> and

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
that on as you can see that and

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.920 
that on as you can see that and
hopefully<00:03:37.220> that's<00:03:37.430> that's<00:03:37.880> coming<00:03:38.750> through

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
hopefully that's that's coming through

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.759 
hopefully that's that's coming through
good<00:03:39.220> just<00:03:40.220> flip<00:03:40.400> it<00:03:40.489> off<00:03:40.670> that's<00:03:41.269> easy

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
good just flip it off that's easy

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.509 
good just flip it off that's easy
finally<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.950> 600<00:03:43.840> ax<00:03:44.840> arty<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.890> can<00:03:46.250> see<00:03:46.430> it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
back up nice and easy middle foot same
locking<00:03:57.170> thing<00:03:57.410> turn<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.670> actually<00:03:59.000> off

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
locking thing turn it on it actually off

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.580 
locking thing turn it on it actually off
block<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:01.040> then<00:04:01.850> on<00:04:02.140> turn<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.500> can

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
block and then on turn that so you can

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.039 
block and then on turn that so you can
see<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.220> it's<00:04:04.910> actually<00:04:05.329> as<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.510> context

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
see that and it's actually as a context

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.229 
see that and it's actually as a context
menu<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:06.829> actually<00:04:06.980> easier<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.549> set<00:04:08.209> up

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
menu so it's actually easier to set up

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.729 
menu so it's actually easier to set up
even<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.660> advanced<00:04:08.900> settings<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.350> all<00:04:09.500> that

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
even the advanced settings and all that

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.400 
even the advanced settings and all that
so<00:04:10.040> Devon<00:04:10.910> makes<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.239> better<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.350> of

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
so Devon makes it better and then of

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.400 
so Devon makes it better and then of
course<00:04:12.440> turn<00:04:12.799> back

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
course turn back

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.920 
course turn back
hit<00:04:13.770> that<00:04:13.920> twice<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.820> that's<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:17.930> so

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
hit that twice and that's that one so

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.640 
hit that twice and that's that one so
for<00:04:19.140> my<00:04:19.260> test<00:04:19.709> what<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.370> did<00:04:20.700> was<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:21.000> put<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
for my test what I did was I put the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.710 
for my test what I did was I put the
scary<00:04:22.650> phone<00:04:23.180> collapsible<00:04:24.180> as<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.360> could<00:04:24.510> see

quantity of the light those are the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.930 
quantity of the light those are the
things<00:05:31.890> I'm<00:05:32.070> trying<00:05:32.220> to<00:05:32.400> measure<00:05:32.669> in<00:05:32.850> this

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
things I'm trying to measure in this

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.760 
things I'm trying to measure in this
little<00:05:33.240> test<00:05:33.510> so<00:05:34.169> let's<00:05:34.200> take<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.530> look<00:05:34.650> at

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
little test so let's take a look at

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.590 
little test so let's take a look at
those<00:05:34.860> pictures<00:05:35.280> now<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.790> see<00:05:36.270> what<00:05:36.450> we've

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
those pictures now and see what we've

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:42.310 
those pictures now and see what we've
got<00:05:39.590> these<00:05:40.590> are<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:40.950> images<00:05:41.100> that<00:05:41.640> I<00:05:41.669> shot

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
got these are the images that I shot

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.200 
got these are the images that I shot
starting<00:05:43.320> with<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.590> flashes<00:05:44.040> in<00:05:44.190> order<00:05:44.580> these

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
starting with the flashes in order these

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.040 
starting with the flashes in order these
first<00:05:45.570> four<00:05:45.840> are<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.400> 1600<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.669> next<00:05:48.630> set<00:05:48.840> are

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
first four are the 1600 the next set are

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.190 
first four are the 1600 the next set are
the<00:05:49.190> 3200<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.820> 4<00:05:51.120> after<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.450> were<00:05:51.600> shot<00:05:51.930> at

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
the 3200 the 4 after that were shot at

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.300 
the 3200 the 4 after that were shot at
at<00:05:53.870> 6400<00:05:54.870> then<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.470> last<00:05:55.620> four<00:05:55.890> were<00:05:55.980> shot<00:05:56.190> at

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
at 6400 then the last four were shot at

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.510 
at 6400 then the last four were shot at
12,800<00:05:57.300> ISO<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.710> what<00:05:58.890> you're<00:05:59.040> looking<00:05:59.340> at

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.689 

I<00:07:48.960> think<00:07:49.740> the<00:07:50.030> 600px<00:07:51.030> RT<00:07:51.800> wins<00:07:52.800> hands<00:07:53.100> down<00:07:53.220> on

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 
I think the 600px RT wins hands down on

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.640 
I think the 600px RT wins hands down on
these<00:07:53.820> images<00:07:54.060> if<00:07:54.810> you<00:07:54.990> look<00:07:55.169> at<00:07:55.290> the<00:07:55.410> glow<00:07:55.620> of

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650 
these images if you look at the glow of

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.550 
these images if you look at the glow of
the<00:07:55.800> candles<00:07:56.430> in<00:07:56.490> each<00:07:56.669> one<00:07:57.000> the<00:07:57.840> quality<00:07:58.139> of

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 
the candles in each one the quality of

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.920 
the candles in each one the quality of
the<00:07:58.680> light<00:07:58.889> the<00:07:59.130> color<00:07:59.490> of<00:07:59.789> the<00:07:59.910> light<00:08:00.120> I<00:08:00.419> think

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:00.930 
the light the color of the light I think

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.740 
the light the color of the light I think
that<00:08:01.440> it's<00:08:01.620> it<00:08:02.370> just<00:08:02.400> winds<00:08:02.970> even<00:08:03.300> over<00:08:03.630> the

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:03.750 
that it's it just winds even over the

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:12.999 
that it's it just winds even over the
580<00:08:04.229> which<00:08:04.770> to<00:08:04.949> be<00:08:05.070> honest<00:08:05.400> shock<00:08:05.639> to<00:08:05.850> me
