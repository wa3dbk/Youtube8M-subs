pone star emblem is highlighted in white

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.100 
pone star emblem is highlighted in white
see<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
see I just make sure you get that

situated the way you want it and then
you're<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.400> duplicate<00:01:41.400> layer<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> then

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
you're going to duplicate layer and then

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
you're going to duplicate layer and then
toggle<00:01:43.110> outline<00:01:43.619> again<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> goes<00:01:44.399> back<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
toggle outline again so it goes back to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.170 
toggle outline again so it goes back to
fill<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.320> pick<00:01:46.320> any<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.130> any<00:01:47.340> color<00:01:47.820> of

go back and fix the place

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.179 
go back and fix the place
after<00:02:14.760> i<00:02:14.840> finished<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> emblem<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:17.040> want

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
after i finished the emblem but you want

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.030 
after i finished the emblem but you want
to<00:02:17.250> move<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.489> down<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> layer<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.109> white

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
to move it down a layer so the white

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.740 
to move it down a layer so the white
from<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.430> loop<00:02:21.359> isn't<00:02:21.719> overlapping<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.650> stem

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
from the loop isn't overlapping the stem

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.229 
from the loop isn't overlapping the stem
and<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:24.989> I<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.230> go<00:02:25.530> ahead<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.239> toggle

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.429 
and then I just go ahead and toggle
outline<00:02:27.689> and<00:02:29.420> duplicate<00:02:30.420> layer<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.079> can

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
outline and duplicate layer so you can

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.209 
outline and duplicate layer so you can
have<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.549> P<00:02:32.790> shape<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.739> make<00:02:34.739> it<00:02:34.859> filled<00:02:35.069> up

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
have the P shape and make it filled up

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.970 
have the P shape and make it filled up
and<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.730> pretty<00:02:35.909> much<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:37.079> did<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.799> back
