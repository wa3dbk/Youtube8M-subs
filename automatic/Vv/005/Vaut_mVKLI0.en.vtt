like you know a lot of the questions
that<00:00:20.880> people<00:00:21.270> constantly<00:00:21.840> raise<00:00:22.140> every<00:00:22.529> day

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that people constantly raise every day

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.099 
that people constantly raise every day
like<00:00:22.890> where<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:23.699> when<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> die<00:00:24.210> go<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
like where do you go when you die go to

heaven go to hell you go you know

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.820 
heaven go to hell you go you know
whatever<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.930> case<00:00:28.109> may<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.320> whether<00:00:28.650> you're

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
whatever the case may be whether you're

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
whatever the case may be whether you're
religious<00:00:29.220> or<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.359> was

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
religious or not and I think that was

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.849 
religious or not and I think that was
definitely<00:00:30.510> his<00:00:30.929> biggest<00:00:31.289> fears<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.740> he

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
definitely his biggest fears like he

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
definitely his biggest fears like he
doesn't<00:00:32.219> know<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.790> unknown<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.149> that's<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
doesn't know and be unknown and that's a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240 
doesn't know and be unknown and that's a
common<00:00:34.290> fear<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> lot<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> different

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
common fear with a lot of different

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
common fear with a lot of different
people<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.270> everyday<00:00:36.540> like

I would have liked a little bit more

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.390 
I would have liked a little bit more
context<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> same<00:01:08.010> time<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
context but then at the same time that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
context but then at the same time that
also<00:01:08.549> leaves<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.299> bit<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> mystery

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
also leaves open a little bit of mystery

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
also leaves open a little bit of mystery
to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> character<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.460> damn<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to the character and just like damn you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
to the character and just like damn you
know<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.110> him<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.890> was

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
know what was up with him what what was

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
know what was up with him what what was
his<00:01:14.670> backstory<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.299> imagining<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:16.110> far<00:01:16.619> as

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
his backstory I'm imagining as far as

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
his backstory I'm imagining as far as
like<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> accident<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.520> guessing<00:01:17.820> you're

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
like the accident I'm guessing you're

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
like the accident I'm guessing you're
probably<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.750> human<00:01:19.140> accident

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
probably just like a human accident

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
probably just like a human accident
maybe<00:01:19.920> he<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.220> into<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> car<00:01:20.790> accident<00:01:20.820> or

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
maybe he got into a car accident or

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
maybe he got into a car accident or
maybe<00:01:21.390> he'll<00:01:21.630> ran<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:22.080> maybe<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> big

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
maybe he'll ran over maybe it was a big

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
maybe he'll ran over maybe it was a big
tragedy<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.330> sort<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> Bach<00:01:25.409> came<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.799> at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
tragedy of some sort and Bach came in at

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
tragedy of some sort and Bach came in at
the<00:01:25.979> nick<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> time<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.610> saw<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> dude

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the nick of time and saw that this dude

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060 
the nick of time and saw that this dude
possibly<00:01:27.720> had<00:01:27.869> some<00:01:28.350> big<00:01:28.530> fear<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> his<00:01:29.040> heart

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
possibly had some big fear in his heart

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
possibly had some big fear in his heart
and<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> turn<00:01:30.299> him<00:01:30.509> into

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and he could use that to turn him into

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
and he could use that to turn him into
what<00:01:31.290> he<00:01:31.380> ultimately<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.610> makes<00:01:32.790> me

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
what he ultimately is and that makes me

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
what he ultimately is and that makes me
question<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.479> did<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.320> all

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
question like did he do this with all

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
question like did he do this with all
the<00:01:34.829> sternritter<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.549> give<00:01:35.700> them<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> power

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the sternritter and give them the power

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
the sternritter and give them the power
because<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.049> case<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.710> them

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
because in that case then a lot of them

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.340 
because in that case then a lot of them
will<00:01:38.070> probably<00:01:38.100> not<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:38.939> actual<00:01:39.689> Quincy<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
will probably not be actual Quincy now

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
will probably not be actual Quincy now
the<00:01:40.409> revelation<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> rukia's<00:01:41.369> bankai<00:01:41.820> ideally

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the revelation of rukia's bankai ideally

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
the revelation of rukia's bankai ideally
I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.110> been<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> little<00:01:43.500> bit

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I think it would have been a little bit

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
I think it would have been a little bit
more<00:01:43.770> epic<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.329> more

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more epic and just have that more

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.109 
more epic and just have that more
grandeur<00:01:46.140> feel<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.250> seen<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.700> during<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
grandeur feel had we seen it during the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.700 
grandeur feel had we seen it during the
actual<00:01:48.509> fight<00:01:48.750> because<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.140> pretty<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.380> get

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
actual fight because we pretty much get

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.530 
actual fight because we pretty much get
like<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> ending<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
like the ending of as not in the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.580 
like the ending of as not in the
beginning<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:51.960> chapter<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
beginning of this chapter we get a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.080 
beginning of this chapter we get a
little<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> his<00:01:53.040> backstory<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
little bit of his backstory and then you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
little bit of his backstory and then you
just<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:54.420> him<00:01:54.630> pretty<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:55.020> destroyed<00:01:55.590> from

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
just see him pretty much destroyed from

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.889 
just see him pretty much destroyed from
rukia's<00:01:56.520> bankai<00:01:56.969> which<00:01:57.180> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> shows<00:01:57.689> like

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
rukia's bankai which kind of shows like

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.859 
rukia's bankai which kind of shows like
Oh<00:01:58.049> bankai<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.189> kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> big<00:02:00.210> deal<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
Oh bankai it's kind of a big deal and I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.480 
Oh bankai it's kind of a big deal and I
like<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> design<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.799> looks<00:02:02.009> dope<00:02:02.250> as

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
like the design for it looks dope as

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.920 
like the design for it looks dope as
well<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.420> interesting<00:02:03.630> because

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
well but it's interesting because

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.260 
well but it's interesting because
byakuya<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.860> warns<00:02:05.250> her<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.729> there's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
byakuya kind of warns her that there's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
byakuya kind of warns her that there's
risks<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> other<00:02:07.740> day<00:02:07.860> I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
risks with that and at the other day I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
risks with that and at the other day I
mean<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.670> seemed<00:02:08.819> as

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
mean there is because it seemed as

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.160 
mean there is because it seemed as

happen<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.120> nonetheless<00:02:42.300> at<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> very<00:02:42.900> least

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
happen but nonetheless at the very least

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.900 
happen but nonetheless at the very least
we<00:02:43.170> got<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> see<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.680> design<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.700> just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
we got to see the design of it and just

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.220 
we got to see the design of it and just
what<00:02:45.060> she<00:02:45.180> looks<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
what she looks like in some of the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.320 
what she looks like in some of the
events<00:02:46.560> afterward<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.459> kind<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
events afterward and kind of that it's a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.970 
events afterward and kind of that it's a
big<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.989> risk<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.380> know<00:02:49.470> maybe<00:02:49.770> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
big bit of a risk you know maybe the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.979 
big bit of a risk you know maybe the
risk<00:02:50.610> bigger<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> reward<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.600> guess<00:02:51.780> though

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
risk bigger the reward I guess though

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.240 
risk bigger the reward I guess though
because<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.500> does<00:02:52.650> seem<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.010> very

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
because it does seem to be very

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.920 
because it does seem to be very
effective<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.880> mean<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> took<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.450> as<00:02:54.690> nah

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
effective I mean it took out as nah

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.640 
effective I mean it took out as nah
there<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.290> go

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
there we go

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.260 
there we go
and<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:55.980> merely<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> feel<00:02:56.610> awkward<00:02:56.820> when

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
and this is merely to feel awkward when

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.690 
and this is merely to feel awkward when
byakuya<00:02:57.810> was<00:02:58.050> like<00:02:58.230> oh<00:02:58.380> melt<00:02:58.980> slowly<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.610> then

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
byakuya was like oh melt slowly but then

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.190 
byakuya was like oh melt slowly but then
he<00:02:59.760> starts<00:03:00.030> walking<00:03:00.120> away<00:03:00.360> we<00:03:00.570> have<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.900> go<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
he starts walking away we have to go and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.720 
he starts walking away we have to go and
is<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.410> what<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.890> fuck<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.220> told<00:03:02.550> her

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
is like what the fuck you just told her

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.979 
is like what the fuck you just told her
melt<00:03:02.910> slowly<00:03:03.120> how<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.450> want<00:03:03.690> her<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.840> move

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
melt slowly how you want her to move

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.420 
melt slowly how you want her to move
she's<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> popsicle<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.160> we're<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
she's a popsicle so we're all the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.610 
she's a popsicle so we're all the
beginning<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.910> chapter<00:03:06.330> not<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.750> epic<00:03:07.440> or

beginning in the chapter not as epic or
as<00:03:07.830> impactful<00:03:08.610> though<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.030> did<00:03:09.209> good<00:03:09.390> useful

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
as impactful though it did good useful

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.470 
as impactful though it did good useful
information<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.770> as<00:03:11.190> non<00:03:11.580> his<00:03:11.850> backstory

information as to as non his backstory

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.360 
information as to as non his backstory
as<00:03:12.780> well<00:03:13.110> as<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.500> bit<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.920> insight

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
as well as a little bit more insight

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.580 
as well as a little bit more insight
into<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.820> bankai<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.510> wookie<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.380> was

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
into the bankai of wookie which was

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.690 
into the bankai of wookie which was
pretty<00:03:16.860> interesting<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.459> then<00:03:17.610> we

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
pretty interesting and then we

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.699 
pretty interesting and then we
transition<00:03:18.209> into<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.480> setup<00:03:18.780> where<00:03:19.049> out<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.290> all

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
transition into a setup where out of all

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.530 
transition into a setup where out of all
the<00:03:19.980> characters<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.640> possibly<00:03:21.090> could've<00:03:21.420> get

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the characters I possibly could've get

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.960 
the characters I possibly could've get
we<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.810> ihsani<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.920> Yahtzee<00:03:23.400> -<00:03:23.430> not<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> most

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
we get ihsani and Yahtzee - not the most

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.670 
we get ihsani and Yahtzee - not the most
interesting<00:03:24.720> for<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> most<00:03:25.200> part<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.530> mean

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
interesting for the most part I mean

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.650 
interesting for the most part I mean
asana<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.610> cool<00:03:26.850> whether<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.540> do

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
asana is cool whether you have to do

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.060 
asana is cool whether you have to do
that's<00:03:27.840> always<00:03:28.080> for<00:03:28.500> me<00:03:28.590> every<00:03:28.739> time<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.950> see

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
that's always for me every time I see

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.500 
that's always for me every time I see
got<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.370> drive<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:29.670> thing<00:03:29.730> go<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.299> little

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
got to drive this thing go the little

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.539 
got to drive this thing go the little
imp<00:03:30.690> on<00:03:30.870> Kenpachi<00:03:31.290> shoulder<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.400> get<00:03:32.519> a

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
imp on Kenpachi shoulder so we get a

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.039 
imp on Kenpachi shoulder so we get a
little<00:03:32.670> bit<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.970> transition<00:03:33.209> into<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
little bit of a transition into them and

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.270 
little bit of a transition into them and
then<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.470> kind<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.680> turns<00:03:34.890> into<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.250> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
then it kind of turns into like a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.740 
then it kind of turns into like a
fucking<00:03:35.640> horror<00:03:35.850> movie<00:03:36.180> or<00:03:36.269> something<00:03:36.570> and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
fucking horror movie or something and

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.970 
fucking horror movie or something and
judging<00:03:37.049> from<00:03:37.080> what<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.380> get<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.799> trap

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
judging from what we get with this trap

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 
judging from what we get with this trap
that<00:03:38.130> I'm<00:03:38.190> guessing<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.940> sternritter<00:03:39.239> V

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
that I'm guessing that the sternritter V

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.410 
that I'm guessing that the sternritter V
Guan<00:03:40.260> l<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.950> possibly<00:03:41.430> read<00:03:41.700> minds<00:03:42.030> because

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
Guan l can possibly read minds because

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.150 
Guan l can possibly read minds because
as<00:03:42.660> soon<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:42.989> he<00:03:43.140> saw<00:03:43.320> me<00:03:43.350> thought<00:03:43.709> that<00:03:43.920> this

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
as soon as he saw me thought that this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.490 
as soon as he saw me thought that this
immediately<00:03:45.030> was<00:03:45.239> like<00:03:45.350> spoken<00:03:46.350> out<00:03:46.470> loud

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
immediately was like spoken out loud

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.190 
immediately was like spoken out loud
from<00:03:47.040> sternritter<00:03:47.459> V<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:48.780> guessing<00:03:49.140> that

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
from sternritter V so I'm guessing that

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.319 
from sternritter V so I'm guessing that
the<00:03:49.470> sternritter<00:03:49.709> V<00:03:50.070> is<00:03:50.190> possibly<00:03:50.700> some<00:03:51.120> sort

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
the sternritter V is possibly some sort

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.819 
the sternritter V is possibly some sort
of<00:03:51.450> like<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.870> could<00:03:52.049> go<00:03:52.200> through<00:03:52.500> your<00:03:52.650> mind

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
of like it could go through your mind

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.080 
of like it could go through your mind
and<00:03:53.190> at<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> same<00:03:53.459> time<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.820> could<00:03:53.910> possibly

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
and at the same time it could possibly

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.479 
and at the same time it could possibly
even<00:03:54.450> warp<00:03:55.110> reality<00:03:55.560> because<00:03:56.040> when<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.280> got

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
even warp reality because when you got

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.039 
even warp reality because when you got
to<00:03:56.670> do<00:03:56.790> pretty<00:03:57.000> much<00:03:57.150> goes<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.810> punch

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
to do pretty much goes in for the punch

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.110 
to do pretty much goes in for the punch
it<00:03:58.470> pretty<00:03:59.010> much<00:03:59.130> seems<00:03:59.400> as<00:03:59.519> though<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.880> hits

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
it pretty much seems as though it hits

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.759 
it pretty much seems as though it hits
him<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.570> impacts<00:04:01.140> them<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.440> then<00:04:01.709> he

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
like I said I felt all the design is

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.510 
like I said I felt all the design is
cool<00:06:18.450> very<00:06:18.870> big<00:06:19.260> risk<00:06:19.740> and<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.220> feel<00:06:20.370> as<00:06:20.490> though

cool very big risk and I feel as though

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.469 
cool very big risk and I feel as though
it<00:06:20.700> definitely<00:06:20.790> could<00:06:21.060> have<00:06:21.180> been<00:06:21.300> presented
