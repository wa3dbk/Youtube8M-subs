Craig Joubert the referees are feeling

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160 
Craig Joubert the referees are feeling
that<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.710> game<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.310> flowing<00:00:29.730> much<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
that the game is flowing much more and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.900 
that the game is flowing much more and
they're<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:31.590> feeling<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.189> control<00:00:32.219> their

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
they're also feeling in control their

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
they're also feeling in control their
the<00:00:33.149> players<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.660> listening<00:00:34.020> they're

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
the players are listening they're

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.100 
the players are listening they're
reacting<00:00:35.160> quicker<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.020> going

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
reacting quicker and I think it's going

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
reacting quicker and I think it's going
to<00:00:37.170> be<00:00:37.290> good<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.649> rugby<00:00:37.829> certainly<00:00:38.340> about

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
to be good for rugby certainly about

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
to be good for rugby certainly about
compromise<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> couple<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.809> international

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
compromise a couple of international

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.869 
compromise a couple of international
teams<00:00:40.590> who<00:00:40.739> did<00:00:40.950> used<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.460> slowing<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
teams who did used to like slowing the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.190 
teams who did used to like slowing the
ball<00:00:42.030> gun<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
ball gun but it's going to make a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
ball gun but it's going to make a
difference<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.340> weekend<00:00:44.730> coming<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
difference this weekend coming up a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
difference this weekend coming up a
couple<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.690> tough<00:00:45.870> ones<00:00:46.110> I've<00:00:46.620> written<00:00:46.800> down

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
couple of tough ones I've written down

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.459 
couple of tough ones I've written down
what<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> predictions

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
what I think that the predictions

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.660 
what I think that the predictions
haven't<00:00:49.469> been<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> brilliantly<00:00:50.100> I've<00:00:50.520> got

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
haven't been going brilliantly I've got

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
haven't been going brilliantly I've got
five<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> seven<00:00:51.860> forty<00:00:52.860> seven<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
five out of seven forty seven and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880 
five out of seven forty seven and
nothing<00:00:53.610> five<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> seven<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.110> far<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
nothing five out of seven so far but I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
nothing five out of seven so far but I
think<00:00:56.579> chief<00:00:56.820> vs<00:00:57.210> reads<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
think chief vs reads is going to be a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
think chief vs reads is going to be a
really<00:00:58.109> hard<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.800> call<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really hard one to call but I'm going to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.340 
really hard one to call but I'm going to
go<00:00:59.609> with<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> home<00:01:00.000> side<00:01:00.300> ready<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> plate

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
go with the home side ready to plate

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.660 
go with the home side ready to plate
some<00:01:01.559> good<00:01:01.739> rugby<00:01:01.920> they<00:01:02.219> smashed<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
some good rugby they smashed the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.340 
some good rugby they smashed the
Crusaders<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> remember<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> Chiefs

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
Crusaders so you can remember the Chiefs

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
Crusaders so you can remember the Chiefs
at<00:01:04.650> home<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.610> they've<00:01:05.850> had<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> very

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
at home you know they've had a very

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.570 
at home you know they've had a very
successful<00:01:06.450> trip<00:01:07.049> overseas<00:01:07.860> bidding<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
successful trip overseas bidding the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.060 
successful trip overseas bidding the
shocks<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.630> lines<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.320> they're<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
shocks and the lines so they're going to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.429 
shocks and the lines so they're going to
be<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.689> tough<00:01:12.900> side<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> beat

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
be I think of a very tough side to beat

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
be I think of a very tough side to beat
the<00:01:14.159> Lions<00:01:14.460> don't<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> enough<00:01:14.970> against<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the Lions don't have enough against the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.359 
the Lions don't have enough against the
Brumbies<00:01:15.600> especially<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.830> Canberra<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
Brumbies especially not in Canberra and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
Brumbies especially not in Canberra and
other<00:01:17.549> Brumbies<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.060> travel<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.570> they've

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
other Brumbies of travel then they've

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.760 
other Brumbies of travel then they've
gone<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:18.990> home<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> doesn't<00:01:19.650> always

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
gone back home but it doesn't always

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.080 
gone back home but it doesn't always
mean<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.580> off<00:01:20.790> your<00:01:20.939> game

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
mean that you that you off your game

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
mean that you that you off your game
when<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.110> should<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.409> for<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
when you do it but we should look for a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.990 
when you do it but we should look for a
free<00:01:22.860> scoring<00:01:23.250> game<00:01:23.400> there<00:01:23.610> they're<00:01:23.790> quite

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
free scoring game there they're quite

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
free scoring game there they're quite
good<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:25.530> terms<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> structured<00:01:26.759> play<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
good in terms of the structured play and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
good in terms of the structured play and
that<00:01:27.240> lines<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> strong<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.680> are

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that lines of strong that they are

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
that lines of strong that they are
leaking<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.340> few<00:01:29.520> trials<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> moment<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
leaking a few trials at the moment the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.069 
leaking a few trials at the moment the
Crusaders<00:01:31.229> clinical<00:01:32.159> against<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> shocks
