using the cardboard wood glue and bondo

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
using the cardboard wood glue and bondo
itself<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.140> sanded<00:00:19.590> down<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.920> shape<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.430> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
itself and sanded down the shape in it I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.060 
itself and sanded down the shape in it I
had<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> reshape<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> top<00:00:22.380> multiple<00:00:22.859> times

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
had to reshape the top multiple times

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
had to reshape the top multiple times
because<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.580> wasn't<00:00:23.820> wide<00:00:24.060> enough<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.500> top

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
because it wasn't wide enough so the top

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
have the mold which we have created for

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.700 
have the mold which we have created for
the<00:00:35.630> center<00:00:36.630> piece<00:00:36.780> right<00:00:37.170> here<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.590> going

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the center piece right here it's going

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.100 
the center piece right here it's going
to<00:00:37.800> connect<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.210> some<00:00:39.329> products<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
needle out of clay and then we created a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.150 
needle out of clay and then we created a
mold<00:00:49.530> okay<00:00:50.809> with<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> mold<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.739> heated<00:00:52.949> up

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
mold okay with that mold we heated up

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
mold okay with that mold we heated up
some<00:00:54.199> hot<00:00:55.199> blue<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.730> hot<00:00:56.730> glue<00:00:56.940> sticks<00:00:57.239> then

some hot blue and hot glue sticks then

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.599 
some hot blue and hot glue sticks then
we<00:00:58.079> create<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> needles<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.250> hot<00:00:59.430> glue

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we create the needles out of hot glue

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.920 
we create the needles out of hot glue
the<00:00:59.879> reason<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> chose<00:01:00.300> huh<00:01:00.510> quit<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:00.899> because

can angle them at least three are not
yet<00:01:48.360> done<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.840> still<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> needles<00:01:49.649> form

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
yet done I still make the needles form

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
yet done I still make the needles form
but<00:01:50.820> once<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.450> needles<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
but once you put your needles in you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.780 
but once you put your needles in you
literally<00:01:53.159> add<00:01:53.490> hot<00:01:54.119> glue<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.140> hold<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
literally add hot glue to hold them in

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.830 
literally add hot glue to hold them in
and<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.000> melt<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.329> husband<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and you can melt the husband of a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.440 
and you can melt the husband of a
actually

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
actually

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.600 
actually
to<00:01:58.600> make<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> little<00:01:59.049> bit<00:01:59.200> stronger<00:01:59.500> okay<00:02:02.610> make

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
to make a little bit stronger okay make

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.830 
to make a little bit stronger okay make
sure<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.880> can<00:02:04.030> hang<00:02:04.180> them<00:02:04.270> all<00:02:04.479> different

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
sure you can hang them all different

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.029 
sure you can hang them all different
angles<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:05.200> your<00:02:05.320> life<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.530> will<00:02:05.860> generally

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
angles of your life you will generally

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.520 
angles of your life you will generally
want<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.430> have<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.579> backward<00:02:07.149> angle<00:02:07.600> but<00:02:08.470> you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
want to have a backward angle but you

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.229 
want to have a backward angle but you
can<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.519> angle<00:02:09.789> different

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
can as you can see we angle different

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.869 
can as you can see we angle different
angles<00:02:10.539> different<00:02:11.319> heights<00:02:11.760> none<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> these

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
angles different heights none of these

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.690 
angles different heights none of these
needles<00:02:13.180> are<00:02:13.660> symmetrical<00:02:14.319> so<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:15.430> want<00:02:15.640> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
needles are symmetrical so you want to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.300 
needles are symmetrical so you want to
be<00:02:15.790> able<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.000> change<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.540> little<00:02:16.569> bit

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
be able to change it up a little bit

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.839 
be able to change it up a little bit
let's<00:02:18.310> see<00:02:18.489> what<00:02:18.640> also<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> talk<00:02:19.269> about

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
let's see what also want to talk about

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.400 
let's see what also want to talk about
that's<00:02:21.849> pretty<00:02:22.239> much<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
that's pretty much it is this is the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.589 
that's pretty much it is this is the
update<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> Neela<00:02:24.280> project<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.000> hopefully

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
update on the Neela project so hopefully

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.910 
update on the Neela project so hopefully
today<00:02:25.780> once<00:02:25.989> again<00:02:26.049> we'll<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> cast

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
today once again we'll get into the cast

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.520 
today once again we'll get into the cast
of<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.790> put<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.750> i'll<00:02:28.959> bundle<00:02:29.260> that

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
of this and put on and i'll bundle that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.580 
of this and put on and i'll bundle that
on<00:02:30.000> cast<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.180> couple<00:02:31.450> more<00:02:31.569> needles<00:02:31.930> we've<00:02:32.410> got

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
on cast a couple more needles we've got

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.949 
on cast a couple more needles we've got
more<00:02:32.739> needles<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.459> then<00:02:34.209> my<00:02:34.420> wife<00:02:34.720> is

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
more needles on and then my wife is

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.390 
more needles on and then my wife is
going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.290> busy<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.830> she's<00:02:36.010> gonna<00:02:36.160> paint

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
going to get busy and she's gonna paint

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.830 
going to get busy and she's gonna paint
that's<00:02:36.819> her<00:02:36.940> little<00:02:37.090> project<00:02:37.510> she<00:02:37.599> wants<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
that's her little project she wants to

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.500 
that's her little project she wants to
paint<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.099> hope<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.519> enjoy<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.030> far<00:02:40.239> a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
paint it so I hope you enjoy it so far a

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.870 
paint it so I hope you enjoy it so far a
