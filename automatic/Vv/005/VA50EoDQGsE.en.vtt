00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.580 
controllers if you play a lot on the on
the<00:02:50.310> Xbox<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.080> really<00:02:52.590> recommend<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:54.590> so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the Xbox you I really recommend this so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.920 
the Xbox you I really recommend this so
what<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.549> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.910> use<00:02:57.060> this

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.550 

obviously<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.049> don't<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
obviously you don't need the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:14.030 
obviously you don't need the
instructions<00:03:04.950> for<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.880> plug-and-play<00:03:06.120> stuff

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.560 

so<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.250> goes<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.640> back<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.360> your

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
so this goes in the back of the of your

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.470 
so this goes in the back of the of your
controller<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.890> I'll<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.250> bring<00:03:18.400> my<00:03:19.330> new

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
controller so I'll just bring my new

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.620 
controller so I'll just bring my new
Gears<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.440> War<00:03:20.500> 3<00:03:20.650> controller<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.360> will

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
Gears of War 3 controller so this will

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.780 
Gears of War 3 controller so this will
just<00:03:22.720> go<00:03:22.870> into<00:03:22.900> there<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.640> will

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
just go into there like that this will

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.540 
just go into there like that this will
go<00:03:27.910> into<00:03:28.060> your<00:03:28.150> console<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.920> will<00:03:30.040> charge

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
go into your console and it will charge

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.360 
go into your console and it will charge
so<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.210> a<00:03:31.240> rechargeable<00:03:32.100> set<00:03:33.100> rather

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
so this is a rechargeable set rather

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.750 
so this is a rechargeable set rather
than<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:33.910> come<00:03:34.360> with<00:03:34.390> this<00:03:35.610> with<00:03:36.610> these

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
than the one come with this with these

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.070 
than the one come with this with these
ones<00:03:37.000> into<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.330> battery<00:03:37.890> operated<00:03:38.890> ones<00:03:40.080> so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
ones into the battery operated ones so

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.670 
ones into the battery operated ones so
if<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.230> play<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> lot<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.530> definitely
