00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello people I hope you are fine 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.410
 Today I wanted you to stop that 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.750
 to introduce special and that my 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.839
 self-made care nail polish is it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 actually no nail polish but it is so 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.970
 but a care oil like a fleece 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 the nails strengthens people it is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.040
 do not tell secret recipe so as 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.430
 First we need olive oil best 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.579
 cold pressed because that's all 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 vitamins and nutrients are still included 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 So yes, and I have it completely 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 important is - oil 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.050
 I now have this one from Italy 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.520
 imported I think there is there 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 There is certainly also here in the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 Switzerland or in Germany also in the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.010
 pharmacy and castor oil gives it to the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.330
 nail a certain luster and it is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.010
 good for growth in general for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.810
 to use the hair and eyelashes 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.830
 he is our nails and then leads 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 the nails would have closed 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 Resistant and the nail too 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.240
 strengthen 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.790
 that's important we need lemon oil 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 It is a kind of ethical oil 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.270
 Attention it must and 100 percent 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 Of course, be without artificial 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:47.790
 perfumes or ingredients completely 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:49.649
 important 100 pure lemon oil so this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.939
 There is also a day in the drugstore 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:59.100
 look as and then what I still 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 I have a container of nail polish he would have 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.009
 I now have this it is eleven 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.990
 I like it very much because it's still there 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.110
 one like this 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.180
 because in it is a big ball and then 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.730
 we can mix the product better 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.270
 Mix 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.140
 So I 'll tell you like that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.140
 put together 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.780
 So I have the container with 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.890
 nail polish remover cleaned and now 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.890
 can we start 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:48.440
 to do that, and certainly certainly 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:48.440
 up to half and a little more like that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:02.670
 It is about two thirds olive oil now 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:05.480
 From the doctor we almost feel it 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.480
 is full 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.329
 that is enough 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:29.260
 we only need drops of lemon oil 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.900
 So it's a concentrate and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.410
 It does not exaggerate because everything can be done 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 cause skin irritation as try 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.450
 I really only four drops to do a 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.070
 1234 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.670
 and now we can pour the whole thing 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.550
 and at the end it looks like that 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.460
 I shake it a few more times and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.340
 see at the beginning again if the bubble 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.000
 are air bubbles that go then 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.270
 away from us and best we do 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.360
 keep it in a dark place 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.580
 because you know oil like you have to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.580
 actually in dark containers 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.330
 keep it like the pull 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.370
 and oil is also in dark in one 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.380
 dark containers as well as lemon oil and 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.980
 olive oil simply on a dark 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.710
 Offensive , I turn this product so 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.290
 I'm going to repaint my nails 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.480
 want 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.660
 this I do the nail polish medium 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:11.540
 Of course nail polish remover removed 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.820
 remove and then you in the evening before the 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.090
 go to sleep a layer of this 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.150
 take care of it on the nails and leave 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.390
 that act overnight and the next 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.920
 day then I'll do a nail polish 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.590
 break that is also better for the nails 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.190
 and thus the next day in the evening 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.310
 then 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.460
 the new nail polish on it and I am 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.470
 if the sca depending on how long the 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.000
 blog holds 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.500
 once a week, once or twice a week 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.600
 week by that and yes I have to 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.350
 say the effect is really good 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.710
 strengthen the nails markets and through the 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:55.310
 Olive oil turns the nails too 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:06:02.120
 less vulnerable so split less 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:06.290
 from yes and I think it's really good because 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:11.050
 It is time-saving and time-saving because 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:14.420
 to get the nail bath nail care bath 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.490
 actually replaced 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.610
 because if I make a nail bad 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.110
 we have to nails there 20 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:27.410
 quarter of an hour 20 30 minutes the nails 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:31.730
 soak and we have no time 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:34.070
 for something and that's why I find this 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.640
 great too and I'm one of those 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.610
 actually not sitting there for 20 minutes and 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:45.730
 yes I can not do that and that's why 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:48.860
 I actually invented, so to speak 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:53.390
 and yes I hope you liked it 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.530
 and I hope so that I can do this 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.830
 video is useful 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.320
 I hope and yes let me know if 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.740
 I if you have done it 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.560
 and let me know how you like it 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.080
 you found yes and that was all 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.090
 many thanks for watching and 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.090
 until next time bye
