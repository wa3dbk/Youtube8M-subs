00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 well this is our prototype is from a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.800
 blocker using some 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.359
 components 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 here's the device you're going to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.650
 Loading can be putting on sneakers 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.769
 in my underwear pocket 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.769
 its size is 5 centimeters 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.910
 this is the basis of quite yet gives pm 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.600
 to be more or less this size 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.520
 here then would be your car 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 such with the two lights mean 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.239
 that vehicles are released and may have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.739
 out with him and if for some situation 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.850
 of emergency 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.520
 You have to leave the vehicle. 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.559
 was stolen or anything of the kind 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.670
 This is going to be hidden with you here. 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 As you go out as you 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.379
 is going out with him 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.100
 Look what happens. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 two meters away has already begun to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.140
 fail 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:26.210
 The further you stay in the vehicle 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.210
 oh failing now 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.440
 about five feet away 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.460
 starting to fail o in front 3 meters 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460
 and something more or less 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.090
 now I'm going to hide it down here 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:56.340
 where the signal goes bad 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:59.350
 simulating more or less 30 meters 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.229
 the longer you stay but there comes a 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.890
 time he puts out the goal to hide 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:10.000
 about here O signal is bad it 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.510
 erased once or more than 40 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 meters 30 40 meters it turns off the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.380
 vehicle 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.190
 that is, it cuts off the fuel and 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.090
 there we caught him back was in 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:30.959
 direction closer it fires the op 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.959
 coming near the car he's already calling her 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.290
 and if you get too close and saw the lady and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.579
 stay put 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.879
 It does not stop there anymore, it 's just the 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.629
 prototype has what to improve even then 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.629
 come on 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.069
