00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.940
 youtube will be hot fitness here and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 welcome to my squad 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.509
 video cycle three weeks we are three 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 already squats 167 now 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.410
 5 kilo three repetitions six sentences 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.750
 and I'm starting to get it right 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.000
 to rewrite six times three because 6 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.340
 sat trey repetitions fucking times 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.740
 you all who have always bitched that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630
 yes, I'm on it now 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 i do not write it again i in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.989
 my style because otherwise I come 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 after 5 comments old you are 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.200
 you you have no idea and have a look 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.149
 The first sentence is always there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 first thought first sentence 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 is always so ok so fast by 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 so fast that and me quickly 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.460
 Must say the best way I am in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.969
 sumo cross issues have addressed in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.309
 the video 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 I still had that, I had to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.960
 to the osteopath or to the physio or 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.990
 I know what I have to do there 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.080
 check back has a bit 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 fucked and yes I have here now 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 always like the setup with it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.150
 I make myself as broad for that you 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.560
 maybe a little something 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 can learn to look a little bit off 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.000
 how I did that came through well 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.240
 if you compare 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.040
 in the last cycle I had 162 5 so 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.250
 five kilos less three repetitions 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.229
 six sets and had difficulties 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.740
 Japan and now it was actually 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.940
 relatively good that is called gamescom 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.820
 Of course, weight also works accordingly 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.520
 high I'm estimated at if 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.530
 I get up in the morning at 90 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.150
 so slightly overshooted 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.600
 i did not want that until january february 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.040
 I already have it that is 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.700
 eventually the goals will be complete 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.720
 changed soon to 100 kilos and then 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.070
 on the 93er preparation 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.570
 Let's see if I have the opportunities 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.280
 to get the german master title ever 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.410
 After that I will be a weight 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.509
 I will choose the planning better 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 maybe even make change and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.560
 do it and then as soon as possible 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.550
 try my values â€‹â€‹really crass after 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.110
 to get up while I know that 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.250
 not how long this one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.470
 progression will be like that 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.959
 Progression continues to be an issue 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 then really everything new but that will be 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.320
 But now at some point 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.430
 like you said here you see technology 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.250
 inhale baumann exciting has it 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.260
 seen and dropped down to the height in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.420
 squat in the cave 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.290
 So not in the squat but in the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 booty and maybe even if 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.440
 in slight mutation sees the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.060
 this further reinforces that on the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.200
 side of this war had because through 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.940
 I always think that way 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.220
 a little bit turned away because I did 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.290
 the page was totally weak 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.870
 is fine if you if you are a point 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.489
 hate the hurt especially in the back 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.739
 By the way, gold is always wanting to see 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.900
 Above all, he does not want to shit 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.860
 to get away is why I have so much 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.260
 do as I really have and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.200
 rubber bands rumgerannt is hunkel 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.209
 friends like a world champion 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.500
 everything has brought nothing 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.110
 but here you see this setup the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.200
 breathing technique we have to go out 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.750
 still practice but look I am 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.640
 curious where the whole match leads 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.250
 first is the national championship 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.209
 next year in april or so nrw that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.190
 means we still have 98 89 months in 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.569
 I'll still be a few months away 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.099
 pack on it 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.769
 It's only just begun 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.519
 are just asked that in the morning c3 w2 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.499
 what does Michael mean two weeks ago? 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.719
 or week 3 that simply means 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:51.879
 about so you know where I am first 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:54.579
 at cycle once started the whole and 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.139
 the current cycle I have been doing it 22 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.150
 is a four weeks showed that is it 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.920
 is always tough from me now shows 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.919
 three who are we now in 23 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.530
 week 1 would be like once a week would be two 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.950
 how two and three would be w3 and w4 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.620
 like 4 or after we continue with c4 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.090
 w124 becomes week one after each cycle 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.250
 always the weight the right weight 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.039
 increased who really knows 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.419
 can feel free the training plan video 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.979
 look at this I made a video 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 where I explain everything like the whole 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.270
 works so now we are already in 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.190
 fifth set break in between always three 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.810
 to five again eleven three to five 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.690
 Repeats three to five minutes 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.490
 you have to do that now and the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.860
 last sentence was the first time where I 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.460
 So it had to really grab where you say 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.169
 could 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.780
 well that was more violent now he was there 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.060
 first rapper to like the first one 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.949
 I let myself down too fast 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.740
 far ahead had the weight on the 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.289
 tiptoe and accordingly was the 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.330
 set a bit on yes and the 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.710
 two last repetitions since there was 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.039
 I'm just glad that I'm through 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.020
 was 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.990
 where you have to say if I have you now 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.620
 Force technology would have to say where that now 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.870
 is after these three repetitions 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.030
 now in this sentence in the sixth sentence 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.949
 could i say i would say so 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.050
 could then make two more 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.820
 So I could be right now 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.900
 five repetitions do with it when 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.740
 I might even want 6 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.199
 so that you roughly estimate that 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.940
 But that is already it is 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.990
 then really at the limit yes and i can 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.389
 I'll probably tell you 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.870
 can keep my shape better than that 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.310
 most of you now 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.719
 that's why it's different again 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.639
 if everyone says okay I can do it 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.159
 repeat two more 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.349
 or three repetitions more I can 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.229
 I think I'm still working on the limit 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:48.090
 without having to completely pack up here 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.099
 again, the legs posing 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.419
 compared to the waist i try it 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.490
 hinzubekommen so my 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.289
 thigh circumference is greater than the 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.740
 Men waist up to the next video 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.740
 take care
