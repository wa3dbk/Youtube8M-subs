is which isn't bad at all I'm definitely

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.569 
is which isn't bad at all I'm definitely
okay<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.470> losing<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.220> lot

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
okay with that but we are losing a lot

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.179 
okay with that but we are losing a lot
of<00:01:50.610> our<00:01:51.360> loot<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.920> very

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
of our loot so we have to be very

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
of our loot so we have to be very
careful<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:53.850> upgrading<00:01:54.420> these<00:01:54.540> things

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
careful with upgrading these things

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
careful with upgrading these things
we're<00:01:55.049> gonna<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.460> oh

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
we're gonna try and get all of that oh

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
we're gonna try and get all of that oh
no<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.450> mean<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> do<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
no I don't mean to do that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.209 
no I don't mean to do that
exit<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.090> enough<00:02:00.630> loot<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
exit so we don't have enough loot to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
exit so we don't have enough loot to
hire<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.430> rest<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.880> them<00:02:03.000> we're<00:02:03.210> gonna<00:02:03.329> need

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
hire the rest of them we're gonna need

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.209 
hire the rest of them we're gonna need
ourselves<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.290> iron<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.009> fine

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ourselves some more iron and the fine

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.410 
ourselves some more iron and the fine
thing<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.820> whole<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.329> were

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
thing is that this whole time we were

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.160 
thing is that this whole time we were
trying<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.719> upgrade<00:02:06.960> our<00:02:07.560> iron<00:02:08.520> mines<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:10.050> we

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
trying to upgrade our iron mines so we

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.570 
trying to upgrade our iron mines so we
have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.500> very<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:10.890> careful<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.280> we're

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
have to be very very careful that we're

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.950 
have to be very very careful that we're
about<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.970> attack<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.450> once

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
about to attack in once

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.420 
about to attack in once

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
what's gonna happen victory nice so we

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.670 
what's gonna happen victory nice so we
didn't<00:02:17.700> get<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.910> much<00:02:17.970> from<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:19.440> didn't

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
didn't get that much from it we didn't

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
didn't get that much from it we didn't
lose<00:02:19.860> any<00:02:20.160> troops<00:02:20.520> or<00:02:20.670> anything<00:02:20.880> but<00:02:21.210> we<00:02:21.330> only

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
got 12 iron from that attack so we're

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.150

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
slots guys these are different areas

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.880 
slots guys these are different areas
where<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.990> build<00:03:01.230> things<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.590> right<00:03:01.710> now

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
where you can build things so right now

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.800 
where you can build things so right now
we<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.190> build<00:03:02.400> barns<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.450> build<00:03:03.630> an

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
we can build barns and we can build an

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.620 
we can build barns and we can build an
altar<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.700> we--or<00:03:05.700> but<00:03:05.910> we<00:03:05.970> actually<00:03:06.450> can't

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
altar of we--or but we actually can't

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.170 
altar of we--or but we actually can't
build<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.990> because<00:03:07.260> we<00:03:07.410> need<00:03:07.560> gems<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.970> build

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
build that because we need gems to build

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.360 
build that because we need gems to build
that<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:09.660> only<00:03:09.960> have<00:03:10.320> 70<00:03:10.920> right<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:11.160> so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that and we only have 70 right now so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.370 
that and we only have 70 right now so
we're<00:03:11.490> gonna<00:03:11.580> go<00:03:11.730> ahead<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.240> build<00:03:12.810> ourselves

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
we're gonna go ahead and build ourselves

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.320 
we're gonna go ahead and build ourselves
another<00:03:13.620> barn<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.400> I'm<00:03:14.520> actually<00:03:14.760> kidding

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
another barn but I'm actually kidding

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.380 
another barn but I'm actually kidding
because<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.780> don't<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.220> enough<00:03:17.220> iron<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.270> we

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
because we don't have enough iron so we

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.540 
because we don't have enough iron so we
have<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.630> wait<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.990> this<00:03:19.170> iron<00:03:19.410> over<00:03:19.800> here<00:03:19.980> guys

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
have to wait on this iron over here guys

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.640 
have to wait on this iron over here guys
oh<00:03:20.580> yes<00:03:21.570> there's<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.990> little<00:03:22.080> bit<00:03:22.320> right<00:03:22.470> there

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
oh yes there's a little bit right there

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
oh yes there's a little bit right there
so<00:03:23.070> we<00:03:23.190> can<00:03:23.310> collect<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> little<00:03:23.880> bit<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so we can collect this a little bit of
