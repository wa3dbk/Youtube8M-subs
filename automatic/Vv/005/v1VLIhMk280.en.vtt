00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 thank you 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.460
 give us encouragement that we have always known 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.170
 a lot if you have feedback if 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
 you have a complaint a question and so on 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 what you want good now yes we go to 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.190
 with the theme do and the theme is basically 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.890
 the best is no one can you eat and you 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 I'm counting it because to me in what 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.310
 I feel like I'm training 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 too much and what happens when you train 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.060
 too much you generally need more 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.210
 clear nutrients yes because your body 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.710
 you need a calorie intake or a 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.990
 energy so they can walk in 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.460
 fullness what happens that obviously the 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.990
 nutrients will be required from the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.970
 supplements and especially the 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.620
 food is happening that is me 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.840
 happening in these moments that I'm 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.570
 defining the body is being defined 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 I'm doing a lot and doing routines 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.530
 cardiovascular gym routines 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.310
 but what's happening is making me very hungry 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.470
 It happens that if I start eating 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.300
 weightless sandwiches eat pasta and 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.370
 he started eating hot dogs that are 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.320
 eat foods that are not at all 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.910
 healthy that especially have a 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.700
 load 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 very high what you are going to do is not 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.390
 be in caloric deficit that is 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.250
 those who have fewer calories than those 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.010
 I need therefore I will not go down 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.350
 then a very very good weight 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.440
 option to live since the best of all 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.000
 they are eating grilled chicken and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 you know why I tell you this because 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.020
 we obviously need some 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.880
 macronutrients and micronutrients 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.620
 but the most important are the 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.910
 macronutrients as I always tell you 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.930
 the macronutrients are proteins 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.340
 carbohydrates and fats because it 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.660
 they call macronutrients called with the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.690
 students because our body what 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.950
 need in great abundance 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.440
 independently is to say a person 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.140
 skinny if a person is obese if it is a 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.820
 person who stays with a good weight 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.710
 anyway or some nutrients that 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.350
 we as people are in great 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.880
 obviously the amount of weight is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.400
 is going to require a little more or a little 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.450
 less protein as much as it was 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.310
 as of carbohydrates 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.110
 I'll tell you here I'll be very 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.459
 sincere with this and I want to invite you to 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.050
 that as much happened to the plate 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.640
 especially you can eat it before 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.140
 train you can eat it after 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.900
 train you can eat it in midmorning 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.580
 you can accompany it with a fruit to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.080
 to give you your carbohydrates that you need 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.239
 because I'm going to talk about those 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.489
 very important macronutrients that are 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.690
 essential especially for training 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.370
 muscular 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.840
 the body obviously needs the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.720
 proteins, carbohydrates and fats 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.170
 each one has a function in our 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.120
 organism 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.610
 the proteins obviously serve to 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.160
 regenerate our muscle tissue and 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.900
 form the muscles 100 grams of 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.700
 chicken lettuce in the description of the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.280
 video I 'm going to put the whole table 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.550
 of 100 grams of breast of 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.410
 chicken or lean meats those 100 grams 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.050
 of chicken marc per 100 grams of 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.750
 bad chicken is going to give your body 190 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.730
 calories will give you 7 grams of fat 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.620
 will give you 0 grams of carbohydrates 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.330
 for that I tell you that you accompany him with 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.220
 a fruit to bring that great 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.350
 amount of carbohydrates you need 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.460
 your body to achieve a community 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.070
 substantial and look at this and record 0 very 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.720
 but very important that is the most 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.800
 important for muscle training in 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.970
 the protein has 29 grams of protein 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.270
 per 100 grams 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.160
 it is said that chicken is basically the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.990
 most a protein then it's very 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.700
 you can buy it in 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.320
 Medallions I always buy medallions 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.520
 of chicken so they come from 100 to 125 grams 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.949
 40 chicken breast stockings 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.470
 it's very important for that because if you 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.750
 you think about what I was doing before 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.490
 I recommend Sanchez all sandwiches 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.960
 what's up with that the sandwich is no longer 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.849
 you will fill like the Chicken 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.870
 chicken usually tends to fill you up 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.659
 little more because of its content that happens 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.330
 what happens with this that if you take two 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.370
 bread torrijas either whole wheat bread or 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.710
 white bread you will contribute to your body 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.900
 almost 125 calories and what are you going to 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.580
 give them a lot of carbohydrates without 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.050
 put a tower to that that we 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.449
 we leave you with no sandwich 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.000
 apparently it is going to be so small it will 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.250
 to have a sandwich of almost 300 to 350 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.169
 calories so eye are you eating 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.449
 chicken breast are you eating things 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.699
 healthier for your body you are 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.650
 eating smart and therefore you go 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.169
 to grow smart and will define your 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.479
 body intelligently if you already know by 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.599
 Please, I have the breast as an option 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.130
 chicken or grilled chicken 100 grams 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.180
 of grilled chicken if it is larger is 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.270
 better you know by 100 grams of each 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.240
 of 100 grams of the body you have 29 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.520
 protein grams 7 grams of fat 0 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.960
 grams of carbohydrates you know friends 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.000
