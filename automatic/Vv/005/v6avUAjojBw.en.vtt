00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
ebay bid on it and I think I got it for

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.390 
ebay bid on it and I think I got it for
what's<00:00:27.930> 20<00:00:28.170> bucks<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:28.800> about<00:00:28.890> 20<00:00:29.130> bucks<00:00:29.250> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
what's 20 bucks I think about 20 bucks I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160 
what's 20 bucks I think about 20 bucks I
was<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.609> shipping<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> everything<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
was like shipping and everything so I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.389 
was like shipping and everything so I
think<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.070> might<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.279> been<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
think that's right it might have been a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.950 
think that's right it might have been a
little<00:00:32.520> cheaper<00:00:32.790> than<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.940> actually<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.750> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
little cheaper than that actually so I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.000 
little cheaper than that actually so I
don't<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.410> there's<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> good<00:00:34.739> deal<00:00:34.860> in

don't know if there's a good deal in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.319 
don't know if there's a good deal in
this<00:00:35.130> box<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.940> there's<00:00:36.149> no<00:00:36.210> more

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
