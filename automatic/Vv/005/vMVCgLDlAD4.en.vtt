will<00:01:58.860> level<00:01:59.159> up<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> you'll<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.729> better

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
will level up and you'll be better

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.990

stronger<00:02:00.509> faster<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.670> forth

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
stronger faster and so on and so forth

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.990 
stronger faster and so on and so forth
now<00:02:03.630> personally<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.320> don't<00:02:04.590> use<00:02:05.159> them<00:02:05.430> too<00:02:05.700> much

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
now personally I don't use them too much

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.719 
now personally I don't use them too much
and<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.869> haven't<00:02:07.140> had<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.560> feed<00:02:07.890> him<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.520> day

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and I haven't had to feed him in a day

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
and I haven't had to feed him in a day
or<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> suspect<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.020> can<00:02:10.170> probably

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
or two so I suspect you can probably

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.650 
or two so I suspect you can probably
keep<00:02:10.649> him<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.069> quite<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.250> while<00:02:11.489> before<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
keep him for quite a while before you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.820 
keep him for quite a while before you
feed<00:02:12.959> him<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
feed him if you don't you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
feed him if you don't you
isn't<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.190> much<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.690> have
