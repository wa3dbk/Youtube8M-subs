00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 Difficult to vacation as it works straws 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.750
 the doubts for our category of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.540

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.480

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.860
 headquarters helm greet all worker 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.940
 health of the Brazilian worker 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 how you question on vacation is one 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.860
 constitutional right of the worker 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.109
 right that is in the federal constitution 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.140
 and also in clt article 129 of the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.900
 clt says that every employee will have the right 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.840
 annually to the enjoyment of a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 holiday period without prejudice to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 remuneration the first places 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.530
 even those who did not work the year 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.630
 whole were dismissed asked 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 dismissal before he is entitled to 1 12 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.150
 Aug every month worked 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.830
 or that month is considered 15 days or 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.369
 But let's admit he worked 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 three months and 16 if he will be entitled to 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.189
 4 12 which must be paid at the moment 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 termination but when it works 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.520
 whole year what is more normal the inter 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 he is entitled to enjoy the holidays in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 rest with the payment that the greater 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.450
 we'll explain soon 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.729
 right how it works and many 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 For doubts, for example, he arrives in the hospital. 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.009
 today to work and they tell me so 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 today you tomorrow you're on vacation has 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.020
 still many companies that do this 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 that's right 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.380
 unfortunately there is a lot of company that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 fires employee looks the morning will be 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.440
 vacation you know no, that's not right 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 because the right law itself 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.610
 Article 129 of the EC Treaty establishes a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.690
 prior notice period 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.730
 on vacation 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.120
 the company has to say to the employee 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.520
 after he got all that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
 holiday period she has the right to 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.200
 say when it will go on vacation the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.630
 ideal would be to match the employee 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.630
 When do I want to go on vacation? 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.030
 make a range except with combination 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.040
 fine with the employee but sometimes 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.440
 company has to scale and when 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.020
 He wants to climb. He has to warn. 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.930
 necessarily with the exception of one 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.500
 advance notice of at least 30 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.060
 days 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.720
 She has to say, look, I'm going to leave. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.620
 you will be on vacation here 35 day in 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.690
 day such 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 it is the obligation of the company but the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.760
 employee may refuse to leave the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.940
 holidays if this notice was not granted 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.550
 at least 30 days in advance 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.790
 that the person to go on vacation 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.100
 ooo money of the remuneration of those 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.170
 vacation in which you are deposited in the account 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.590
 of the employee saw at least two 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.570
 days before then go on vacation are 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.390
 two basic rules that you should 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.060
 pecoraro right to learn to check 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.070
 rule the warning that will come out of 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.150
 vacation has to be 30 days 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.610
 advance 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.090
 the payment of these holidays must be 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.730
 at least two days in advance 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.100
 if I'm going on vacation on the 30th, my 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.780
 payment at least until the 28th when 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.800
 It's on my account, but I 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.800
 I can refuse 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.019
 now it is important to say that it is these 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.820
 issues should be addressed first 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.010
 place with the company on the basis of 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.920
 with the head with rh 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.019
 if you do not skin the union come 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.610

 you do not need to identify us 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.709

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.140
 does not need to be immediate it can be 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.820
 up to two years after leaving employment 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.000
 even so that there is no loss 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.700
 to work 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.940

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.950
 prescription is two years after the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.250
