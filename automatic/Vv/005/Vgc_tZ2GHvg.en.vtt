as<00:00:02.730> I<00:00:03.240> already<00:00:03.389> told<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.080> an<00:00:04.200> earlier

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
as I already told you in an earlier

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.950 
as I already told you in an earlier
video<00:00:04.710> our<00:00:05.339> stands<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.270> making<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> game

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
video our stands are making the game

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.950 
video our stands are making the game
laggy<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.770> me<00:00:07.950> because<00:00:08.309> there<00:00:08.880> are<00:00:09.030> lots<00:00:09.780> of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
laggy for me because there are lots of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.390 
laggy for me because there are lots of
our<00:00:10.170> stands<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.330> stadium<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:13.400> therefore

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
our stands in this stadium and therefore

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.689 
our stands in this stadium and therefore
I<00:00:14.610> added<00:00:14.969> an<00:00:15.089> option<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.410> soccer<00:00:17.160> minigame

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
I added an option to the soccer minigame

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.519 
I added an option to the soccer minigame
to<00:00:18.300> simply<00:00:18.690> disable<00:00:19.350> armorstands<00:00:20.750> at<00:00:21.750> all<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to simply disable armorstands at all so

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
to simply disable armorstands at all so
if<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.279> walk<00:00:23.460> back<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> stadium<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> see

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
if I walk back to the stadium you see

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
if I walk back to the stadium you see
they<00:00:25.140> are<00:00:25.170> simply<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.279> disappear<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
they are simply going to disappear and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.009 
they are simply going to disappear and
Rhenish<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.699> this<00:00:29.699> works<00:00:29.970> without<00:00:30.539> killing

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
Rhenish and this works without killing

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.430 
Rhenish and this works without killing
them<00:00:31.170> actually<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.980> if<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.850> simply<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.390> back<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
them actually so if I simply go back to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
them actually so if I simply go back to
the<00:00:34.590> settings<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.300> turn<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.540> on<00:00:36.660> again<00:00:38.540> then

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the settings and turn them on again then

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.040 
the settings and turn them on again then
you<00:00:40.020> will<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:41.000> they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.270> simply<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you will see they are simply going to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
you will see they are simply going to
reappear<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> state<00:00:44.190> they<00:00:44.550> were<00:00:44.610> before

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
reappear in the state they were before

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.459 
reappear in the state they were before
and<00:00:46.230> yeah<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.370> that's<00:00:47.520> pretty<00:00:47.700> nice<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
and yeah I think that's pretty nice and

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.750 
and yeah I think that's pretty nice and
I<00:00:49.469> did<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.860> tell<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.430> either

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I did not tell about them either

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.100 
I did not tell about them either
so<00:00:51.739> let<00:00:52.739> me<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.520> explain<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.510> how

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so let me just go and explain to you how

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.569 
so let me just go and explain to you how
this<00:00:56.010> thing<00:00:56.070> works<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.890> how<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this thing works so this is how one of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
this thing works so this is how one of
the<00:00:59.730> unrest<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.149> fence<00:01:00.420> could<00:01:00.629> look<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the unrest and fence could look like you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.640 
the unrest and fence could look like you
see<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> basic<00:01:02.820> understand<00:01:03.719> he<00:01:04.439> has

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
see it's just a basic understand he has

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
see it's just a basic understand he has
the<00:01:04.890> armor<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.670> she<00:01:06.270> has<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.780> custom<00:01:07.380> name

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the armor on and she has a custom name

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.420 
the armor on and she has a custom name
and<00:01:09.290> what<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.070> him<00:01:11.189> invisible

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and what can we do to make him invisible

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.450 
and what can we do to make him invisible
well<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.720> first<00:01:12.990> try<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.619> course<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
well the first try of course would be to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.840 
well the first try of course would be to
give<00:01:14.939> him<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> invisible<00:01:15.810> tag<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.310> do

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
give him the invisible tag so if we do

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.510 
give him the invisible tag so if we do
this<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.900> only<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.590> unrest<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> itself

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this you see only the unrest and itself

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
this you see only the unrest and itself
disappears<00:01:20.990> the<00:01:22.520> armor<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> head<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
disappears the armor and the head and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
disappears the armor and the head and
the<00:01:25.350> custom<00:01:25.710> name<00:01:25.740> they're<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the custom name they're still going to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
the custom name they're still going to
be<00:01:26.850> visible<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.960> course<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.530> want

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
be visible and of course we do not want

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
be visible and of course we do not want
that<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
that because this is not going to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
that because this is not going to
decrease<00:01:31.320> any<00:01:31.650> lag<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> players

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
decrease any lag for the players

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
decrease any lag for the players

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
themselves so Lux turnable has

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.569

discovered<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.840> new<00:01:36.869> npt<00:01:37.829> tag<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.340> armor

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.410 
point 8.1 pre-release 4 which is called
marker<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.829> simply<00:01:47.220> click<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> button

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.280 
disappears and if you go into game mode
3<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.140> only

he<00:02:04.979> will<00:02:05.159> not<00:02:05.369> render<00:02:05.670> at<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.140> not

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
he will not render at all so this is not

we can simply revert that of course by

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.630 
we can simply revert that of course by
giving<00:02:12.780> him<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> marker

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
giving him the marker

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.059 
giving him the marker
value<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> zero<00:02:15.120> again<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.890> here<00:02:16.890> have

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
value of zero again and here have

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.979 
value of zero again and here have
prepared<00:02:17.879> an<00:02:18.120> armor<00:02:18.390> stand<00:02:18.420> which<00:02:18.780> has<00:02:18.959> a

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
prepared an armor stand which has a

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.759 
prepared an armor stand which has a
custom<00:02:19.500> skoros<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:21.120> has<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.330> custom<00:02:21.810> markers

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
custom skoros which has a custom markers

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.130 
custom skoros which has a custom markers
called<00:02:22.980> one<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.940> simply<00:02:24.239> determine

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
called one so we can simply determine

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.280 
called one so we can simply determine
who<00:02:25.290> he<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.390> here<00:02:27.390> I've<00:02:27.599> prepared<00:02:28.019> an

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
who he is and here I've prepared an

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.780 
who he is and here I've prepared an
entity<00:02:28.650> data<00:02:28.830> command<00:02:29.220> which<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.519> going<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
entity data command which is going to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
entity data command which is going to
give<00:02:30.000> him<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.299> motion<00:02:30.750> upwards<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.129> he

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
give him a motion upwards so you see he

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.350 
give him a motion upwards so you see he
is<00:02:32.819> going<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.239> jump<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.940> why<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.150> show<00:02:36.329> you

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
is going to jump and why do I show you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
is going to jump and why do I show you
this<00:02:36.659> because<00:02:36.900> here<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> villager

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
this because here we have a villager

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.640 
this because here we have a villager
which<00:02:39.269> I'm<00:02:39.420> constantly<00:02:39.780> teleporting<00:02:40.409> to<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
which I'm constantly teleporting to the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.949 
which I'm constantly teleporting to the
understand<00:02:41.159> and<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:44.159> make<00:02:44.370> him<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.360> marker

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
understand and if we make him a marker

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.309 
understand and if we make him a marker
like<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.730> can<00:02:47.879> still<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.629> anything<00:02:48.810> with

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
like this we can still do anything with

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.050 
like this we can still do anything with
the<00:02:49.470> arm<00:02:49.560> stand<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.370> going<00:02:50.609> to<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.790> exactly

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the arm stand it's going to be exactly

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.000 
the arm stand it's going to be exactly
the<00:02:51.480> same<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.019> we<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.440> still<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the same you see we can still have the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.789 
the same you see we can still have the
physics<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.549> him<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.930> move<00:02:55.109> him<00:02:55.290> around<00:02:55.410> as

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
physics to him and to move him around as

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.720 
physics to him and to move him around as
we<00:02:55.920> please<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.859> yeah<00:02:58.859> it's<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.220> still<00:02:59.430> going

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
we please and yeah it's all still going

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.960 
we please and yeah it's all still going
to<00:02:59.849> work<00:03:00.060> however<00:03:01.099> we<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:03.140> make<00:03:04.140> him<00:03:04.970> we

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to work however we have to make him we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.170 
to work however we have to make him we
can<00:03:06.120> make<00:03:06.390> him<00:03:06.709> not<00:03:07.709> invisible<00:03:08.340> at<00:03:08.549> any<00:03:08.819> time

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
can make him not invisible at any time

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.210 
can make him not invisible at any time
by<00:03:09.780> setting<00:03:09.989> his<00:03:10.230> microscope<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.859> zero<00:03:11.129> again

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
by setting his microscope to zero again

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.319 
by setting his microscope to zero again
so<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.579> can<00:03:11.609> simply<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.150> n<00:03:12.299> t<00:03:12.329> th<00:03:12.510> at<00:03:14.120> like<00:03:15.120> this

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
so we can simply do n t th at like this

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.940 
so we can simply do n t th at like this
and<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:15.629> see<00:03:15.810> he<00:03:16.109> is<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.650> visible

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and you see he is going to be visible

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.479 
and you see he is going to be visible
again<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:18.690> think<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> very<00:03:20.250> nice

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
again and I think this is a very nice

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.319 
again and I think this is a very nice
feature<00:03:20.790> because<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:22.769> provides<00:03:23.760> mapmakers

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
feature because it provides mapmakers

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.099 
feature because it provides mapmakers
the<00:03:25.019> ability<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:26.239> do<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.389> same<00:03:27.599> thing<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.049> i

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
the ability to do the same thing that i

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.259 
the ability to do the same thing that i
could<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.859> wither<00:03:29.430> skulls<00:03:29.819> earlier

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
could do with wither skulls earlier

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.360 
could do with wither skulls earlier
because<00:03:30.750> they<00:03:30.930> were<00:03:30.989> totally<00:03:31.799> invisible<00:03:32.040> as

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
because they were totally invisible as

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.349 
because they were totally invisible as
well<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:33.530> yeah<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.459> can<00:03:35.669> see<00:03:35.700> them<00:03:36.120> in

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
well and yeah so you can see them in

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.599 
well and yeah so you can see them in
gamma<00:03:36.629> 3<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:37.799> probably<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.459> main

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
gamma 3 and this is probably the main

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.690 
gamma 3 and this is probably the main
point<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.150> decreases<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.049> lag<00:03:40.319> by<00:03:40.829> making

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
point it decreases the lag by making

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.759 
point it decreases the lag by making
them<00:03:41.849> disappear<00:03:42.079> by<00:03:43.079> letting<00:03:43.319> them<00:03:43.560> never

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
them disappear by letting them never

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.550 
them disappear by letting them never
