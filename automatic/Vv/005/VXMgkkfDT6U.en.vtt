00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
alright so I'm going to show you how to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.549 
alright so I'm going to show you how to
tether<00:00:11.600> the<00:00:12.309> sprint<00:00:13.309> hero<00:00:13.750> on<00:00:14.750> sprint<00:00:15.290> doesn't

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
tether the sprint hero on sprint doesn't

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.710 
tether the sprint hero on sprint doesn't
allow<00:00:15.800> tethering<00:00:16.040> on<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.430> device<00:00:16.700> there's<00:00:17.630> a

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
allow tethering on the device there's a

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.980 
allow tethering on the device there's a
software<00:00:18.140> bug<00:00:18.290> that<00:00:19.330> lets<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.480> tether<00:00:20.689> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
software bug that lets you tether and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.580 
software bug that lets you tether and
you<00:00:21.650> got<00:00:21.800> to<00:00:21.920> use<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.779> USB<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:24.170> tether<00:00:24.380> it<00:00:24.560> and

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
you got to use the USB to tether it and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.609 
you got to use the USB to tether it and
are<00:00:24.830> only<00:00:24.950> or<00:00:25.220> some<00:00:25.400> windows<00:00:25.640> XP<00:00:26.029> or<00:00:26.060> Vista<00:00:26.619> so

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
are only or some windows XP or Vista so

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.150 
are only or some windows XP or Vista so
first<00:00:27.950> we<00:00:28.070> go<00:00:28.189> to<00:00:28.220> wireless<00:00:28.640> controls<00:00:30.160> mobile

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
first we go to wireless controls mobile

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.500 
first we go to wireless controls mobile
network<00:00:31.900> settings<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:34.579> then<00:00:34.610> from<00:00:35.090> there<00:00:35.149> we

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
network settings and then from there we

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.630 
network settings and then from there we
go<00:00:35.690> down<00:00:35.720> and<00:00:35.960> we<00:00:36.320> say<00:00:36.530> mode<00:00:36.739> of<00:00:36.890> operation<00:00:37.010> or

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
go down and we say mode of operation or

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.520 
go down and we say mode of operation or
we<00:00:37.700> switch<00:00:37.970> hybrid<00:00:38.570> which<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.170> sound<00:00:39.380> by

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
we switch hybrid which it sound by

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.939 
we switch hybrid which it sound by
default<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.220> One<00:00:40.610> X<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.170> 1x<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.710> just

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
default to the One X and the 1x is just

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.040 
default to the One X and the 1x is just
a<00:00:43.070> tenth<00:00:43.699> of<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.090> data<00:00:44.300> kind<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:44.809> edge

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
a tenth of the data kind of like edge

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.939 
a tenth of the data kind of like edge
network<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:46.399> go<00:00:46.579> back<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:48.739> we<00:00:48.800> can

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
network so we go back and then we can

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.279 
network so we go back and then we can
change<00:00:49.219> an<00:00:49.730> or<00:00:49.789> first<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:50.899> have<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.019> make<00:00:51.260> sure

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
change an or first we have to make sure

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.750 
change an or first we have to make sure
that<00:00:51.559> we're<00:00:51.679> connected<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.399> can<00:00:52.579> go<00:00:52.699> ahead

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
that we're connected but we can go ahead

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.660 
that we're connected but we can go ahead
and<00:00:52.910> uncheck<00:00:53.809> mobile<00:00:54.109> network<00:00:54.679> and<00:00:54.920> then<00:00:55.550> you

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
and uncheck mobile network and then you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.729 
and uncheck mobile network and then you
gotta<00:00:55.820> check<00:00:56.059> on<00:00:56.179> both<00:00:56.329> really<00:00:56.719> fast<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.589> we

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
gotta check on both really fast so we

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.930 
gotta check on both really fast so we
checked<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.160> mobile<00:00:58.399> network<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.850> then

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
checked the mobile network and then

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.750 
checked the mobile network and then
check<00:00:59.420> sharing<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:01.280> basically<00:01:01.460> just

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
check sharing and I basically just

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.790 
check sharing and I basically just
tricked<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.210> phone<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:03.440> not<00:01:03.589> fast

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
tricked the phone because it's not fast

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.820 
tricked the phone because it's not fast
enough<00:01:04.630> figure<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.260> then<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.650> just

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
enough figure it out and then that just

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.500 
enough figure it out and then that just
says<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.070> same<00:01:07.430> settings<00:01:07.820> are<00:01:07.970> off<00:01:08.120> which<00:01:08.360> is

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
says the same settings are off which is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.420 
says the same settings are off which is
fine<00:01:08.720> okay<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.900> that's<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:12.440> up<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.190> top

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
fine okay and that's it so up on the top

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.210 
fine okay and that's it so up on the top
there's<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.450> arrows<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.930> shows<00:01:15.740> that<00:01:15.770> were

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
there's the arrows that shows that were

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.940 
there's the arrows that shows that were
connected<00:01:16.880> can't<00:01:17.720> really<00:01:17.960> see<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.170> nice<00:01:18.680> job

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
connected can't really see it nice job

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.840 
connected can't really see it nice job
camera<00:01:19.930> but<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.170> can<00:01:21.320> go<00:01:21.440> back<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
camera but then you can go back to the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.870 
camera but then you can go back to the
network<00:01:23.360> settings<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.050> then<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.670> mode<00:01:25.850> of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
network settings and then the mode of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.370 
network settings and then the mode of
operation<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.600> can<00:01:26.750> actually<00:01:26.870> switch<00:01:27.230> it

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
operation you can actually switch it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.360 
operation you can actually switch it
back<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.650> hybrid<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.220> then<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.760> will<00:01:28.910> law<00:01:30.370> it

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
back to hybrid and then it will law it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.570 
back to hybrid and then it will law it
takes<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.700> few<00:01:31.910> few<00:01:32.630> seconds<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.370> it<00:01:34.430> will

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
takes a few few seconds and then it will

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.070 
takes a few few seconds and then it will
go<00:01:34.610> back<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.810> 3g<00:01:36.230> or<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.680> sprint

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
go back to the the 3g or the sprint

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.630 
go back to the the 3g or the sprint
sprint<00:01:39.080> network<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.740> get<00:01:39.950> about<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.490> make

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
sprint network so you get about to make

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.760 
sprint network so you get about to make
down<00:01:40.910> or<00:01:41.180> whatever<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.110> in<00:01:42.260> your<00:01:42.380> area

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
down or whatever you have in your area

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.370 
down or whatever you have in your area
but<00:01:43.040> that's<00:01:43.250> about<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.900> have<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.110> go<00:01:45.230> as<00:01:45.320> a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
but that's about it you have to go as a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.870 
but that's about it you have to go as a
sprint<00:01:45.710> website<00:01:45.800> or<00:01:46.280> not<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:46.520> sprint<00:01:46.760> website

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
sprint website or not the sprint website

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.170 
sprint website or not the sprint website
but<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> HTC<00:01:48.050> website<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.800> get<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.180> driver

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
but the HTC website and get the driver

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.320 
but the HTC website and get the driver
for<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.600> hero<00:01:51.790> intimate<00:01:52.790> like<00:01:52.970> I<00:01:53.060> said<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
for the hero intimate like I said it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.600 
for the hero intimate like I said it
only<00:01:53.480> works<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:53.870> windows<00:01:55.120> 7<00:01:56.120> and<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:58.280> have<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
only works on windows 7 and you have to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.370 
only works on windows 7 and you have to
have<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.060> tethered<00:01:59.690> with<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.960> USB<00:02:00.200> cable

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
have the tethered with the USB cable

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.400 
have the tethered with the USB cable
doesn't<00:02:00.980> work<00:02:01.190> over<00:02:01.460> Bluetooth<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:03.110> that's

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
doesn't work over Bluetooth and that's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.760 
doesn't work over Bluetooth and that's
it<00:02:03.620> so<00:02:03.860> that's<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.520> software<00:02:04.970> bug<00:02:05.120> in<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:06.590> is

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
it so that's a software bug in this is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.410 
it so that's a software bug in this is
version<00:02:06.980> 1.5<00:02:07.790> which<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:09.530> hero<00:02:09.709> ships<00:02:10.069> with

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
version 1.5 which the hero ships with

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.350 
version 1.5 which the hero ships with
and<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:12.500> imagine<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.250> next<00:02:13.489> version<00:02:13.700> or<00:02:14.090> two

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
and I imagine in the next version or two

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940 
and I imagine in the next version or two
or<00:02:14.660> whenever<00:02:14.840> they<00:02:15.170> come<00:02:15.349> out<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> next

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
or whenever they come out with the next

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.170 
or whenever they come out with the next
version<00:02:16.129> they'll<00:02:16.489> probably<00:02:16.670> end<00:02:16.879> up<00:02:16.970> fixing

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
version they'll probably end up fixing

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.850 
version they'll probably end up fixing
that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.650 

and<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.640> course<00:02:20.730> once<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.240> done<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.510> can

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
and of course once you're done you can

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.080 
and of course once you're done you can
just<00:02:21.690> shut<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> off<00:02:22.650> no<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:23.910> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just shut it off no it's all there is to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.120 
just shut it off no it's all there is to
it
