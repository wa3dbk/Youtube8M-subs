00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.620
 In this video we will see how to make an apple pie 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 which is based on the quintessential Galician biscuit: 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 THE BICA 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.380
 These are the ingredients that we are going to use, 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.460
 You will find the quantities at the end of the video 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.020
 and on the website 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.080
 We will start by melting the butter at medium heat 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 We put the eggs in a bowl 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.080
 To make sure everyone goes well, 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.880
 we cast them before in a small one. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.020
 We add the sugar and beat ... 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.580
 so that it mixes better, we will throw it 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.300
 We add the liquid cream (cream of milk) 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.300
 We mix the yeast with the flour ... 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.960
 We put it in a sieve and sprinkle it little by little 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.440
 We add a quantity and we remove ... 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600
 This is the consistency that remains ... 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.380
 Finally we add the butter 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.560
 that is already warm 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.140
 We melt it for 30 seconds in the microwave 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.060
 Mix until it is well integrated ... 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.120
 You see that now it is lighter than before 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 Let's throw it in the mold ... 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.820
 We lined the mold with baking paper 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.580
 We wet it slightly before and the paper no longer moves ... 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 Peel and clean the apples, 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220
 taking away their hearts 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.720
 and cutting them in sheets 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.520
 We distribute them orderly by the cake ... 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.960
 in this way, riding one lightly on the other 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.260
 When they are distributed, sprinkle sugar over the oven 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.960
 This is a large cake and depending on the width of the mold ... 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.380
 it will take more or less time 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.640
 Notice how it grows in the oven ... 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.500
 At 50 minutes we puncture in the center ... 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.640
 if the skewer comes out clean we remove, 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.880
 if it comes out wet we will leave 5 or 10 more minutes 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 And we already have it ... 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.080
 we will let it rest in the mold about 10 minutes 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.520
 After the rest, we remove it from the mold, 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 we grab it by the paper 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.520
 and we put it on a grill 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.800
 we separate the paper and let it cool ... 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.740
 It's already cooled and now we're going to see how it is ... 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.740
 look how tall ... 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.740
 and how fluffy is ... 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.600
 This is vice! 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.960
 This apple pie is based on the Galician bica, 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.220
 if you do not test it, you do not know what you're missing ... 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.380
 And here's our video of the apple pie, 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.880
 If you liked it, I invite you to share it ... 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.220
 and hit the "like" 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.720
 "If you do not test it, you do not know what you're missing ..."
