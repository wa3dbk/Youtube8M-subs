well<00:00:00.960> it's<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.199> airplane<00:00:01.500> that<00:00:01.680> created<00:00:02.010> a

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
well it's the airplane that created a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.730 
well it's the airplane that created a
whole<00:00:02.220> new<00:00:02.399> category<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:03.149> very<00:00:03.419> light<00:00:03.720> jet<00:00:04.080> it

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
whole new category the very light jet it

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.140 
whole new category the very light jet it
was<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.190> revolutionize<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.850> industry

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
was going to revolutionize the industry

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.020 
was going to revolutionize the industry
the<00:00:06.990> predictions<00:00:07.470> from<00:00:07.680> even<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> FAA<00:00:08.490> were

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the predictions from even the FAA were

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970 
the predictions from even the FAA were
that<00:00:09.330> there<00:00:09.510> would<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.750> thousands<00:00:10.559> upon

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
that there would be thousands upon

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.310 
that there would be thousands upon
thousands<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.730> them<00:00:11.820> flying<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:13.110> didn't

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
thousands of them flying and it didn't

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
thousands of them flying and it didn't
quite<00:00:13.410> work<00:00:13.500> out<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.009> way

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
quite work out that way

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
quite work out that way
and<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.849> original<00:00:15.210> clips<00:00:15.420> 500<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.109> never

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and the original clips 500 was never

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
and the original clips 500 was never
quite<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.800> airplane<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.460> intended<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.090> be

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
quite the airplane it was intended to be

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.109 
quite the airplane it was intended to be
but<00:00:18.930> things<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.320> changed<00:00:19.369> this<00:00:20.369> week<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.820> got

but things have changed this week I got

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.840 
but things have changed this week I got
the<00:00:21.210> chance<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.539> fly<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> Eclipse<00:00:22.529> 550<00:00:23.189> and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the chance to fly the Eclipse 550 and

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.790 
the chance to fly the Eclipse 550 and
compare<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> 500<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> got<00:00:25.650> my

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
makes a difference no more warped

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
makes a difference no more warped
plastic<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.239> visual<00:00:42.540> distortion<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.260> the

and<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.930> skid<00:00:46.200> brakes<00:00:46.469> can't<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.460> them

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and I skid brakes can't really see them

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.190 
and I skid brakes can't really see them
but<00:00:47.820> then<00:00:47.940> again<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.510> not<00:00:48.629> likely<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> see

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but then again you're not likely to see

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.860 
but then again you're not likely to see
a<00:00:49.379> blown<00:00:49.680> tire<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> 550<00:00:50.910> landing<00:00:51.270> either<00:00:51.420> and

a blown tire on a 550 landing either and
it's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.199> great<00:00:52.379> system<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> works

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it's a great system you know it works

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's a great system you know it works
really<00:00:53.610> well

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
really well

mine<00:01:11.220> who<00:01:11.460> owned<00:01:11.610> an<00:01:11.760> eclipse<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:12.600> had<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
mine who owned an eclipse actually had a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
mine who owned an eclipse actually had a
great<00:01:13.020> solution<00:01:13.380> he<00:01:13.650> came<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> me<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.369> six

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
great solution he came to me about six

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
great solution he came to me about six
months<00:01:15.030> after<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.299> acquired<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> company<00:01:15.780> came

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
months after I acquired the company came

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
months after I acquired the company came
down<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> visited<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.250> me<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.520> Charleston

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
down and visited with me in Charleston

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.300 
down and visited with me in Charleston
he<00:01:18.060> said<00:01:18.210> hey<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> solution<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.189> we

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
he said hey we have a solution that we

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.770 
he said hey we have a solution that we
think<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:20.790> partner<00:01:21.060> with<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
think we could partner with you on and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.109 
think we could partner with you on and
we<00:01:21.840> could<00:01:21.990> add<00:01:22.200> anti<00:01:22.920> skid<00:01:23.220> brakes<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
we could add anti skid brakes on to the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
we could add anti skid brakes on to the
Eclipse<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.229> said<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
Eclipse and I said do you really

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
Eclipse and I said do you really
thinking<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> pulled<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.310> off<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.610> he<00:01:26.670> said

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
thinking you pulled this off and he said

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.190 
thinking you pulled this off and he said

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
yeah we can so we got him together with

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140 
yeah we can so we got him together with
our<00:01:28.350> engineers<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:29.579> worked<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
our engineers they worked on it for the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.520 
our engineers they worked on it for the

and vehicle that new Eclipse 515 the
most<00:03:02.860> dramatic<00:03:03.340> one<00:03:03.700> certainly<00:03:04.000> from<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.300> pilot

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
most dramatic one certainly from a pilot

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.420 
most dramatic one certainly from a pilot
standpoint<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.320> autothrottle<00:03:05.950> which

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
standpoint is the autothrottle which

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.220 
standpoint is the autothrottle which
we've<00:03:06.610> been<00:03:06.700> playing<00:03:07.330> with<00:03:07.420> here<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:07.810> pretty

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
we've been playing with here it's pretty

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.720 
we've been playing with here it's pretty
amazing<00:03:08.709> for<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.010> category<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.580> aircraft

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
amazing for this category of aircraft

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.150 
amazing for this category of aircraft
it's<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.600> only<00:03:10.840> one<00:03:11.020> that<00:03:11.170> has<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.770> level<00:03:12.040> of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
it's the only one that has this level of

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.820 
it's the only one that has this level of
sophistication<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.230> auto<00:03:14.350> throttles

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
sophistication with the auto throttles

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.979 
sophistication with the auto throttles
and<00:03:15.400> really<00:03:15.820> relieves<00:03:16.360> pilot<00:03:16.840> workload

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
and really relieves pilot workload

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.590 
and really relieves pilot workload
particularly<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.010> single<00:03:18.640> pilot<00:03:18.850> situation

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
particularly in a single pilot situation

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.199 
particularly in a single pilot situation
allows<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.830> pilot<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.190> really<00:03:21.550> focus<00:03:22.060> on

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
allows the pilot to really focus on

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.729 
allows the pilot to really focus on
what's<00:03:22.450> important<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.170> airplane<00:03:23.500> takes

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
what's important in the airplane takes

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.030 
what's important in the airplane takes
care<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.400> speed<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.959> case<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.800> allows

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
care of of speed in this case it allows

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.490 
care of of speed in this case it allows
you<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.430> focus<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.300> half<00:03:28.690> normal<00:03:28.989> situation

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
you to focus on a half normal situation

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.920 
you to focus on a half normal situation
traffic<00:03:30.100> dealing<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.520> ATC<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.180> those<00:03:31.690> sorts

of<00:03:31.989> things<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:32.380> takes<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.739> one-one<00:03:33.220> more

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370
