00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
for new Maps very very intense action

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.830 
for new Maps very very intense action
especially<00:03:19.370> playing<00:03:19.880> like<00:03:20.240> conquest

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
especially playing like conquest

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.570 
especially playing like conquest
domination<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.709> think<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.130> another<00:03:22.340> game

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
domination I think that is another game

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.420 
domination I think that is another game
mode<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.790> they<00:03:23.030> did<00:03:23.209> come<00:03:23.240> up<00:03:23.540> with<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:24.430> come

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
mode that they did come up with and come

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.590 
mode that they did come up with and come
to<00:03:25.580> think<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:25.970> think<00:03:26.000> they<00:03:26.300> added

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
to think of it I think they added

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.480 
to think of it I think they added
another<00:03:27.020> team<00:03:27.380> deathmatch<00:03:27.620> but<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.280> called

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
another team deathmatch but it's called

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.720 
another team deathmatch but it's called
close<00:03:28.730> quarters<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.240> guess<00:03:29.420> but<00:03:30.260> uh<00:03:30.550> as<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:31.670> see

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
