00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.729 
like I said they give you two gigs to
start<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.500> quite<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> bit<00:02:38.690> so

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
start out that's actually quite a bit so

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.680 
start out that's actually quite a bit so
though<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.769> actually<00:02:41.129> show<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.700> instructions

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
though I actually show you instructions

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.280 
though I actually show you instructions
on<00:02:43.080> how<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.440> install<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:45.080> it's<00:02:46.080> pretty

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
on how to install it and it's pretty

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.640 
on how to install it and it's pretty
simple<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.700> Mac<00:02:47.880> version<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
simple this is the Mac version the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.559 
simple this is the Mac version the
Windows<00:02:49.980> version<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.819> isn't<00:02:51.090> too<00:02:51.420> much

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
Windows version really isn't too much

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:04.030 
Windows version really isn't too much
different<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.069> when<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.880> ahead<00:02:56.030> open<00:02:57.030> this

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.979 

once<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.930> opens<00:03:07.970> once<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.180> opens<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:09.840> you

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
once that opens once that opens if you

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.039 
once that opens once that opens if you
look<00:03:10.230> there's<00:03:10.980> actually<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> second<00:03:12.090> window<00:03:12.480> so

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
look there's actually a second window so

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.759 
look there's actually a second window so
you<00:03:13.560> may<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.130> look<00:03:14.280> under<00:03:14.549> your<00:03:15.769> your

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
you may have to look under your your

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.150 
you may have to look under your your
browser<00:03:17.310> window<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.269> find<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.170> second<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:19.859> for

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
browser window to find a second one for

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.259 
browser window to find a second one for
Mac<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:22.019> believe<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.940> Windows<00:03:23.940> there<00:03:24.180> will

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
Mac and I believe on Windows there will

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.890 
Mac and I believe on Windows there will
just<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.690> separate<00:03:25.170> installer<00:03:25.739> window<00:03:26.069> and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
just be a separate installer window and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.259 
just be a separate installer window and
you<00:03:27.900> can<00:03:28.079> just<00:03:28.290> go<00:03:28.470> through<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.889> process<00:03:29.269> on

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
you can just go through that process on

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.500 
you can just go through that process on
Mac<00:03:31.049> it's<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.590> simply<00:03:32.010> drag<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.519> drop<00:03:32.900> and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
Mac it's just simply drag and drop and

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.170 
Mac it's just simply drag and drop and
drag<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.720> drop<00:03:37.130> you'll<00:03:38.130> hear<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.639> icon

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
drag and drop you'll hear a little icon

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.979 
drag and drop you'll hear a little icon
and<00:03:39.510> that's<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.519> now<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.450> go<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.750> your

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
and that's it now if you go to your

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.690 
and that's it now if you go to your
Applications<00:03:43.980> folder

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
Applications folder

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.050

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
think you can rename this I'm just gonna

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.290 
think you can rename this I'm just gonna
let<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.990> alone<00:04:48.229> continue<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:52.470> can<00:04:52.500> upgrade

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
let it alone continue you can upgrade

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.820 
let it alone continue you can upgrade
but<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.509> I<00:04:54.660> said<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.139> starts<00:04:55.470> out<00:04:55.590> with<00:04:55.650> two

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
but like I said it starts out with two

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.969 
but like I said it starts out with two
gigs<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.690> since<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.810> use<00:04:58.139> the<00:04:58.169> referral<00:04:58.830> status

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
gigs and since I use the referral status

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.740 
gigs and since I use the referral status
we'll<00:04:59.460> actually<00:04:59.669> get<00:05:00.320> two<00:05:01.320> gigs<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.270> an<00:05:03.270> extra

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
we'll actually get two gigs and an extra

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.730 
we'll actually get two gigs and an extra
250<00:05:04.530> megabytes<00:05:04.830> so<00:05:05.280> I'm<00:05:05.370> going<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.580> continue

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
250 megabytes so I'm going to continue

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:16.040 
250 megabytes so I'm going to continue
I'm<00:05:07.740> just<00:05:07.979> gonna<00:05:08.099> do<00:05:08.370> typical<00:05:13.699> and<00:05:14.870> like<00:05:15.870> it
