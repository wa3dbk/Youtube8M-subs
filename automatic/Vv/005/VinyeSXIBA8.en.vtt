00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.410
 you can 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.789
 pallara from this new video 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.960
 see how it spreads wide then 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 consists in making two goals and that one must 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.269
 use them in the beginning so that they absorb 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 the blows of cannons and various defenses 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:46.409
 later they become 20 magi where they are 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.110
 they must put in a horizontal position 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:57.600
 that eliminate the various barracks and mines 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:02.149
 extractors and at the end when they put on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.460
 they throw themselves at the wall and at the same time 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.690
 so that it enters the village and they do 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 100 percent that I have the king and the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.030
 queen raise immediately after i 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 sin so that they give him a hand in 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.250
 then launch the furies or the treatment is done 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 giving up the replay is the last thing 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.209
 technique is used above all to attack 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.390
 the town hall level 9 level 10 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:36.420
 and if necessary also level 8 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.069
 but I advise you but to attack there 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.140
 you can be too scarce because there wouldn't be 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:44.399
 gain because already only out of sin 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.890
 they want a nice 102,000 elixirs and ideas 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.530
 for the golems a thousand of black that is not little 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.530
 the proceeding of the decrees I found 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.050
 I'm thirsty with really lucky state 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.050
 because you didn't think I do a hundred 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.520
 unfortunately as you see on a text that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.709
 it will be the kind of engagements of its own 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.680
 anything 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.680
 for the other two they entered lower 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 whichever is the trick used in this 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.340
 finished a greeting to all
