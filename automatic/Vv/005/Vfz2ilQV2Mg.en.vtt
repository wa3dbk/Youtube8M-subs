the 7-piece midnight lace set which are

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.230 
the 7-piece midnight lace set which are
these<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.420> look<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> brushes<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.619> i<00:00:20.240> got

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
these like I look in brushes and i got

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.820 
these like I look in brushes and i got
these<00:00:21.420> recently<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> I've<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.350> been<00:00:22.650> trying

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
these recently and I've just been trying

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.790 
these recently and I've just been trying
them<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:24.390> opinions<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:25.140> these<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
them out and my opinions on these are a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.950 
them out and my opinions on these are a
lot<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.340> than<00:00:26.849> my<00:00:27.000> opinion<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
lot different than my opinion on the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.210 
lot different than my opinion on the
other<00:00:28.109> brushes<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> thought<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> would

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
other brushes so I thought it would

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
other brushes so I thought it would
still<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.789> nice<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.599> share<00:00:30.840> these<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
still be nice to share these with you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.620 
still be nice to share these with you
guys<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> never<00:00:32.610> spend<00:00:33.210> like

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
guys and I know that I never spend like

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.680 
guys and I know that I never spend like
probably<00:00:34.430> more<00:00:35.430> than<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.820> twenty<00:00:36.270> dollars

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
probably more than like twenty dollars

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.590 
probably more than like twenty dollars
on<00:00:36.899> something<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:37.950> without<00:00:38.700> seeing

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
on something like this without seeing

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
on something like this without seeing
reviews<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> if<00:00:40.800> anybody<00:00:41.160> else

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
reviews on it first so if anybody else

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.389 
reviews on it first so if anybody else
is<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:42.059> with<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:43.559> hopefully<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
is like me with that then hopefully this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
is like me with that then hopefully this
will<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.640> helpful<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.270> guys<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
will be helpful for you guys so like I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
will be helpful for you guys so like I
said<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.550> seven<00:00:48.000> different

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
said this that has seven different

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
said this that has seven different
brushes<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.530> all<00:00:49.739> are<00:00:50.100> smaller

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
brushes and they all are smaller

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
brushes and they all are smaller
obviously<00:00:51.149> than<00:00:51.750> face<00:00:51.989> brushes<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.010> think

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
obviously than face brushes so I think

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.430 
obviously than face brushes so I think
they're<00:00:53.820> probably<00:00:54.270> geared<00:00:54.899> towards<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
they're probably geared towards your

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.060 
they're probably geared towards your
eyeballs<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.340> eye<00:00:56.610> area<00:00:57.680> however<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.710> me

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
eyeballs in your eye area however for me

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.220 
eyeballs in your eye area however for me
these<00:00:59.399> didn't<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.329> work<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:00.989> eyes

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
these didn't really work for my eyes

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.799 
these didn't really work for my eyes
because<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.609> small<00:01:02.940> eyes<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.690> if

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
because I have kind of small eyes and if

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
because I have kind of small eyes and if
you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.559> let<00:01:05.369> me<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
you can see like let me show you one of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
you can see like let me show you one of
the<00:01:06.060> brushes<00:01:06.740> that's<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.979> brush<00:01:08.189> that's<00:01:08.490> my

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the brushes that's the brush that's my

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000 
the brushes that's the brush that's my
eye<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.650> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
eye so it's like that's not really it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
eye so it's like that's not really it
doesn't<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.150> work<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.020> mean

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cover more area then you'll probably

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800
