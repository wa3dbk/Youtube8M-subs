00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.770 
being that close to such a vital center
as<00:01:59.720> Liberty<00:02:00.229> Vil's<00:02:00.440> downtown<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.630> from<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
as Liberty Vil's downtown and from the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.520 
as Liberty Vil's downtown and from the
other<00:02:02.929> direction

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
other direction

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.440 
other direction
Liberty<00:02:04.159> villas<00:02:04.399> downtown<00:02:04.850> will<00:02:05.030> benefit

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
Liberty villas downtown will benefit

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.539 
Liberty villas downtown will benefit
from<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:05.810> new<00:02:05.869> little<00:02:06.350> community<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.369> we're

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
from this new little community so we're

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.190 
from this new little community so we're
hoping<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.239> actually<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.600> precedent

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
hoping that this is actually a precedent

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.020 
hoping that this is actually a precedent
for<00:02:09.440> other<00:02:09.649> communities<00:02:10.250> around<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.640> country

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
for other communities around the country

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.080 
for other communities around the country
so<00:02:11.390> many<00:02:11.920> existing<00:02:12.920> towns<00:02:13.160> really<00:02:13.640> need<00:02:13.819> some

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so many existing towns really need some

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.180 
so many existing towns really need some
revitalization<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.500> believe<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:15.980> will

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
revitalization and we believe this will

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.380 
revitalization and we believe this will
offer<00:02:16.370> some<00:02:16.700> very<00:02:16.760> interesting

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
offer some very interesting

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.410 
offer some very interesting
opportunities<00:02:18.579> so<00:02:19.579> in<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.820> house<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.269> you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
opportunities so in the house that you

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.780 
opportunities so in the house that you
see<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> construction<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:21.829> you<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.579> see

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
see on the construction here you can see

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.759 
see on the construction here you can see
that<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> porch<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.600> really<00:02:23.870> quite<00:02:24.140> close<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
that the porch is really quite close to

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.770 
that the porch is really quite close to
the<00:02:24.950> street<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:26.060> will<00:02:26.209> be<00:02:26.329> true<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.570> all

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the street and that will be true of all

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.319 
the street and that will be true of all
the<00:02:26.840> houses<00:02:27.140> along<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> street<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.180> as

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
the houses along the street so that as

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.750 
the houses along the street so that as
pedestrians<00:02:30.200> walk<00:02:30.440> up<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.859> down<00:02:30.920> they<00:02:31.579> have<00:02:31.730> a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
pedestrians walk up and down they have a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.030 
pedestrians walk up and down they have a
connection<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.660> each<00:02:32.810> other<00:02:33.109> which<00:02:33.590> creates

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
connection to each other which creates

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.670 
connection to each other which creates
this<00:02:34.280> wonderful<00:02:34.519> sense<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.180> community<00:02:35.680> my

which is not associated with the front

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
which is not associated with the front
door<00:03:15.950> allows<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.790> light<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.269> cascade<00:03:17.510> down

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
door allows that light to cascade down

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.349 
door allows that light to cascade down

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
being used as a formal space will

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.190 
being used as a formal space will
actually<00:03:28.610> function<00:03:28.849> as<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.209> kind<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.629> library

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
actually function as a kind of library

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.410 
actually function as a kind of library
so<00:03:30.800> that<00:03:31.040> people<00:03:31.519> will<00:03:31.640> be<00:03:31.670> able<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.150> sit<00:03:32.390> here

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
in front of them some of the Japanese

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.720 
in front of them some of the Japanese
architecture<00:03:39.650> books<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.340> I've<00:03:40.430> looked

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
architecture books that I've looked

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.979 
architecture books that I've looked
through<00:03:40.840> show<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:42.140> small<00:03:42.940> garden<00:03:43.940> space<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.599> so

through show a small garden space and so

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.420 
through show a small garden space and so
we're<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.860> doing<00:03:45.980> something

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
we're going to be doing something

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.040 
we're going to be doing something
similar<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.180> where<00:03:47.420> there's<00:03:47.599> a<00:03:47.660> very
