there<00:00:52.260> are<00:00:52.379> others<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> use

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
there are others but you have to use

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.439 
there are others but you have to use
commands<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.829> for<00:00:58.829> example<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.730> use<00:00:59.940> liquid

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
commands and for example we use liquid

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.299

web<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.870> her<00:01:00.989> hosts<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> pretty<00:01:02.129> good

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
web as her hosts they have a pretty good

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
web as her hosts they have a pretty good
knowledge<00:01:02.640> base<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:03.780> familiar

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
knowledge base and I'm pretty familiar

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.920 
knowledge base and I'm pretty familiar
with<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> still<00:01:05.430> be

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
with it but it can still be

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.640 
with it but it can still be
nerve-racking<00:01:06.930> especially<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.409> you're<00:01:07.500> not

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
nerve-racking especially if you're not

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
nerve-racking especially if you're not
accustomed<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> using<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.330> commands<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
accustomed to using these commands and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010 
accustomed to using these commands and
they<00:01:10.799> even<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> pretty<00:01:11.640> big<00:01:12.020> paragraph

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they even have a pretty big paragraph

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
they even have a pretty big paragraph
here<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:14.010> says<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.549> powerful<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
here that says it's powerful but

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170 
here that says it's powerful but
potentially<00:01:16.350> dangerous<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> be

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
potentially dangerous so you have to be

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.670 
potentially dangerous so you have to be
very<00:01:18.450> careful<00:01:18.960> if<00:01:19.259> you're<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
very careful if you're more of a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
very careful if you're more of a
graphics<00:01:20.130> person<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.180> what

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
graphics person you like to see what

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.550 
graphics person you like to see what
you're<00:01:21.479> doing<00:01:21.720> move<00:01:21.900> files<00:01:22.200> around<00:01:22.409> visually

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
you're doing move files around visually

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.179 
you're doing move files around visually
SSH<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.770> probably<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:28.159> one<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
SSH is probably not for you so one of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
SSH is probably not for you so one of
the<00:01:29.369> things<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.450> cPanel

the things you can do if you have cPanel

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.830 
the things you can do if you have cPanel
is<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> backup<00:01:32.570> using<00:01:33.570> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is you can make a backup using this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.600 
is you can make a backup using this
little<00:01:34.140> button<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.040> click<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
little button right here you click it it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.160 
little button right here you click it it
backs<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.110> entire<00:01:37.380> home<00:01:37.619> directory<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
backs up the entire home directory and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.929 
backs up the entire home directory and
creates<00:01:40.170> what's<00:01:40.439> called<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.740> tar<00:01:41.009> tar<00:01:41.460> ball<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
creates what's called a tar tar ball and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
creates what's called a tar tar ball and
you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.049> download<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:44.009> hard<00:01:44.189> drive

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you can download it to your hard drive

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
you can download it to your hard drive
so<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:45.210> great<00:01:45.390> however<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.649> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> have

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so that's great however what if you have

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.249 
so that's great however what if you have
a<00:01:47.340> site<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> our<00:01:49.020> clients

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a site and this is one of our clients

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.460 
a site and this is one of our clients
where<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.600> whole<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.140> your

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
where you just have a whole lot on your

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
where you just have a whole lot on your
server<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.130> guys<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.549> 14<00:01:53.970> gigs<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
server so these guys have 14 gigs it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
server so these guys have 14 gigs it's
going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> while<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:56.100> really

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
going to take a while so you're really

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.450 
going to take a while so you're really
not<00:01:57.560> saving<00:01:58.560> any<00:01:58.680> time<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.159> might<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.369> well

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
not saving any time you might as well

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.670 
not saving any time you might as well
just<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.790> FTP<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.869> that's<00:02:01.049> still<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.469> fast

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
just use FTP so that's still not fast

which is maybe the 400 Meg's and it
takes<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:43.230> lot<00:02:43.620> less<00:02:43.770> time<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.830> were

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
takes a lot less time so if you were

it's confusing see if your host has
cPanel<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.690> try<00:03:00.690> those<00:03:00.870> things<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:02.690> hope
