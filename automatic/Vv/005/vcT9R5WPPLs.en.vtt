00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:11.230
 here is the knife 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.530
 made drill based on 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.550
 traditional Russian knife for shoe 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:24.289
 why was the knife called shoemaker because 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:30.429
 that he was attached to the boot is not in his boot 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:33.469
 but behind the boot on the saddle, but do not suggest 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.620
 that is, this knife and you simple 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.670
 peasants commoners he was 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.629
 not available 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.129
 this knife was owned only by people with good 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.129
 wealth maruti 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.649
 there were such and very many now 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.649
 let's see how he cuts paper 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 traditional test 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.180
 This office paper A4 Che you on 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.180
 she rolls the scheme was a couple 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:25.310
 headquarters at the headquarters we cut off now I 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.310
 I will try to leave the chips visible 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.910
 let's see what we can do with newspapers 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.239
 newspapers cut on new people and because 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.239
 that paper is very thin 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.739
 cast turns 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:53.959
 colleague whether they can pertly for centuries 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:56.890
 either the first time is not very 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.890
 rarity 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.120
 fine 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.290
 walk a little more 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.680
 now try now is the time of hours 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.680
 five 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.310
 on the street I was unable to take pictures of it 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.310
 because it's simple dark 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:17.530
 under the lamp certainly does not publish here 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:20.459
 Slaves of paper cut here such a knife 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 we succeeded 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.130
 let it go 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.900
 some kind of husband and drill 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.870
 steel drill was r18 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.880
 doing satin then doing the longitudinal 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.430
 the reflection of his straight there so clear 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.430
 probably will not 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.080
 will be seen 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:27.660
 garda brass it 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:32.580
 spacer rock whose rock do not know in aspen 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:36.240
 sternum if someone changes their wives or 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.250
 husband come please stones me horn 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.490
 necessary 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:49.380
 so here's a brass spacer too 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:53.759
 to this beech ending we are soaking up 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:59.060
 the lowest here got a little pore 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:06:06.020
 I show how to be cunning I am not going 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.020
 here is the junction between the blade and the guard 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:18.670
 the knife was made from a photograph 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:25.260
 specify hurricane now 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:25.260
 yes the original name of the knife is snowflake 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.520
 I will not change anything this 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:41.460
 man of deed he tried so what new 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:44.460
 invent anything not on the photos he 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.460
 had seen 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.819
