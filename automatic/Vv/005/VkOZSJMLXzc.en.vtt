00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
vertical slice to work in progress we've

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.849 
vertical slice to work in progress we've
worked<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> lot<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.480> things<00:00:15.839> since<00:00:16.560> we

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
worked on a lot of things since we

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.090 
worked on a lot of things since we
basically<00:00:17.310> put<00:00:17.490> quartz<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.390> motorsports

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
basically put quartz and motorsports

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.529 
basically put quartz and motorsports
well<00:00:20.100> actually<00:00:20.160> before<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:20.789> even<00:00:20.970> ship<00:00:21.270> for

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
well actually before we even ship for

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
well actually before we even ship for
motorsport<00:00:21.960> frankly<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.680> carved<00:00:23.039> off<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
motorsport frankly we carved off the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.320 
motorsport frankly we carved off the
team<00:00:23.630> we<00:00:24.630> got<00:00:24.840> Kinect<00:00:25.560> sensors<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.939> asked

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
team we got Kinect sensors and we asked

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
team we got Kinect sensors and we asked
them<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:27.869> experiment<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.769> what's

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
them to go experiment with what's

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.080 
them to go experiment with what's
possible<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.060> connect

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
possible to connect

our cars so I don't know how many were

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.700 
our cars so I don't know how many were
familiar<00:00:35.090> with<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:36.260> history

look<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.579> need<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.939> speed<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:00.839> do<00:01:00.989> things

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
look at need for speed when we do things

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
look at need for speed when we do things
like<00:01:01.500> camera<00:01:01.920> animation<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.670> rewind<00:01:03.119> so<00:01:03.629> our

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
like camera animation and rewind so our

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.389 
like camera animation and rewind so our
goal<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> always<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:05.009> we're<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
goal is always say look we're going to

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.010 
goal is always say look we're going to
take<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> best<00:01:05.820> features<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:06.689> and

take the best features from all over and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.499 
take the best features from all over and
then<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> hit<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.009> rock<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.270> some

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
then I'm going to hit a rock and do some

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.529 
then I'm going to hit a rock and do some
huge<00:01:09.899> huge<00:01:10.590> advances<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.060> bring<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> whole

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
huge huge advances to bring the whole

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.399 
huge huge advances to bring the whole
day<00:01:12.750> long<00:01:12.990> well<00:01:13.860> connect<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.940> available

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
day long well connect was available

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.660 
day long well connect was available
because<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.679> of<00:01:16.709> a<00:01:16.799> sudden<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.399> was<00:01:17.520> an

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because all of a sudden there was an

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
because all of a sudden there was an
entire<00:01:17.970> new<00:01:18.299> ballpark<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> go<00:01:19.319> plan<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:19.950> make

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
entire new ballpark to go plan and make

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
entire new ballpark to go plan and make
mistakes<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> trying<00:01:21.179> things<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
mistakes and trying things and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.809 
mistakes and trying things and
experiment<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:23.399> you're<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> see

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
experiment and what you're going to see

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.880 
experiment and what you're going to see
is<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.690> found<00:01:25.020> we've

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
is a little bit of what we found we've

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.830 
is a little bit of what we found we've
got<00:01:26.069> a<00:01:26.100> lot<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.340> demos<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.209> that<00:01:27.659> we

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
got a lot more demos as well that we

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
got a lot more demos as well that we
didn't<00:01:28.080> bring<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.159> two<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.459> just

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
didn't bring these are two that just

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.149 
didn't bring these are two that just
kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.909> illustrate<00:01:33.470> yeah<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.860> Dan

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
kind of illustrate yeah I think Dan

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.410 
kind of illustrate yeah I think Dan
showed<00:01:35.399> some<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.789> office<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
showed some of that office and the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.779 
showed some of that office and the
resume<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.049> stuff<00:01:37.319> so<00:01:37.560> again<00:01:37.979> Connect<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
resume and stuff so again Connect is

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.460 
resume and stuff so again Connect is
picking<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.750> subtle<00:01:40.020> movements<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
picking up all the subtle movements of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.390 
picking up all the subtle movements of
you<00:01:40.619> including<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
you including the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.060 
you including the
the<00:01:42.610> distance<00:01:43.180> from<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.540> as<00:01:43.870> well<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:44.410> you<00:01:44.950> know

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
the distance from it as well so you know

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.740 
the distance from it as well so you know
we'll<00:01:45.460> show<00:01:45.640> off<00:01:45.730> a<00:01:45.850> lot<00:01:46.030> more<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.450> when<00:01:46.660> we

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
we'll show off a lot more that when we

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.150 
we'll show off a lot more that when we
get<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.050> car<00:01:47.230> experience<00:01:47.530> but<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.070> know

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
get to the car experience but you know

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.070 
get to the car experience but you know
even<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.580> driving<00:01:48.880> experience<00:01:49.020> kind<00:01:50.020> of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
even in the driving experience kind of

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.270 
even in the driving experience kind of
giving<00:01:50.380> what<00:01:50.500> it's<00:01:50.650> like<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.890> actually<00:01:50.920> be<00:01:51.250> in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
giving what it's like to actually be in

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680 
giving what it's like to actually be in
a<00:01:51.400> cockpit<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.850> be<00:01:51.940> able<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.150> look<00:01:52.240> around<00:01:52.450> the

once<00:02:50.830> we<00:02:50.890> got<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:51.250> basic<00:02:51.720> functionality<00:02:52.720> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
once we got this basic functionality and

once we got this basic functionality and
it<00:02:52.900> was<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.290> exciting<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.800> us<00:02:53.920> right<00:02:54.310> it's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
it was just so exciting to us right it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.370 
it was just so exciting to us right it's
like<00:02:54.819> wow<00:02:55.330> all<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.750> sudden<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.350> I

parts I'm actually being able to walk
out<00:02:59.830> and<00:02:59.950> see<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.640> things<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.000> won't<00:03:01.239> see

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
out and see the things that I won't see
