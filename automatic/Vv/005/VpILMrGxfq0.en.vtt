a<00:01:59.330> 12<00:02:00.330> pole<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:00.900> that's<00:02:01.080> yeah<00:02:01.590> jano

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
a 12 pole I think that's yeah jano

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.070 
a 12 pole I think that's yeah jano
meanwhile<00:02:02.430> gonna<00:02:02.580> go<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.910> a<00:02:02.940> toll<00:02:03.210> hatch

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
meanwhile gonna go for a toll hatch

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.359 
meanwhile gonna go for a toll hatch
inside<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.950> his<00:02:05.070> own<00:02:05.250> base<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:06.720> his<00:02:07.369> usual

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
inside of his own base so his usual

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249 
inside of his own base so his usual
antics<00:02:08.580> but<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.420> same<00:02:09.629> unsafe<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
antics but not the same unsafe when I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.570 
antics but not the same unsafe when I
think<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.590> far<00:02:11.099> fish<00:02:11.250> might<00:02:11.370> have<00:02:11.459> gonna

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
think actually far fish might have gonna

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.339 
think actually far fish might have gonna
pay<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.150> went<00:02:12.390> 4-12<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> believe

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
pay up don't went 4-12 to I believe

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.350 
pay up don't went 4-12 to I believe

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
heavy servings although I think if that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.960

so the very least this pressure isn't it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.640 
so the very least this pressure isn't it
forcing<00:04:00.720> farmers<00:04:00.840> actually<00:04:01.049> put<00:04:01.319> down<00:04:01.410> people

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650
