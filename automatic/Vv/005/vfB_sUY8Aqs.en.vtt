 In the morning, use it with a crab. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.300
 especially with large particles where else 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.480

 all these peeling at once 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.059
 It will be much easier to remove skin with more 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 late so to speak and for this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.059
 goals I'm very happy to give you is such a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.780
 sponge raised 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.940
 she is imbued with green clay and they are in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.879
 hell several varieties and that i 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.910
 noticed she much more gently removes everything 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 peeling than commonly used for 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.000
 washing false more coarse and he can 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.570
 all and so that the peeling will be visible yet 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 more notes she removes very carefully 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 everything and flaking and doing so they 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 become less noticeable become 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 less and vice versa they do not increase 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 and that's because often so you 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.810
 I want to be a scrub here happiness is all 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.200
 nevertheless she was a new take and cloaks so 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.229
 that they become even more measured and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.869
 just getting worse is also a video immediately 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.450
 I use this kind of cream from the company 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.990
 Christina This Israeli Pervak ​​Rome 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.299
 to go away 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.259
 acid description there is cream 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.710
 wrote that he contributes to the speedy 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.430
 skin regeneration and peeling faster from 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.890
 it is valid and I keep it just 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.689
 for such cases we use only 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.509
 periodically when i appear 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.180
 any peeling or when me 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.299
 I want to quickly get rid of the saint 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
 some kind of inflammation is also wonderful 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.530
 cream 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 I like it very much and I noticed when I 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 started using cosmetics with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 acids use means for 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.849
 washing use this cream 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.030
 apply masks with acids 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.299
 my skin began to suffer from peeling 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.420
 much lower and understand perfectly well that 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.310
 peeling 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.890
 once in a certain period it is quite 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.459
 naturally our skin is renewed it 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.599
 Well that is our skin regeneration 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.810
 cells are updated and natural 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.420
 process and it is good worse if this 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.730
 It was not worth the trouble should act 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.940
 this cream is very good it fights with 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.549
 peeling but he doesn't give x so much 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.480
 skin saturation and he does not hide 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.150
 consolation even for a few hours and so 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.400
 as I have bold, I really do not like very much 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.799
 such massive dense cream 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.900
 i like big boats with or out 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.079
 some kind of structures so people don't 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.760
 there was such a tool that could 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.730
 to cope and at least for a while 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.790
 ultimately nourish all the peeling and to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.680
 they could not see at least a few hours 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.530
 I recently bought a gel 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.769
 wallpaper and completely unaware 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.130
 found that this gel is very good 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.500
 nourishes the skin and peeling and visibility 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.049
 It becomes me quite recently 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.959
 there was such a problem 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.840
 peeling and literally two days I'm from 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.970

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.019
 will be here he saved me 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.599
 This is a gel of the company is nothing more than a secret we will fold 94 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.349
 percent and my finger just nourishes 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.250
 skin so moisturized that they were not 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.099
 are slowed down 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.709
 and it really saved me because 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.060
 such days when peel off skin 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.250

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.440

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.010

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:18.209
 this gel nose is easier to carry 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.870

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:02.289
 less vulnerable they themselves already easily so 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:06.130
 the site comes from the skin of the face and then it

 in a certain way 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.250
 preferably not suitable for this mask 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.470
