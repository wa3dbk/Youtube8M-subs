00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 but there are people who themselves have to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.120
 speak the voices of world famous 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.099
 actors like our guest dubbing actor 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.269
 Ilya tails Ilya good morning address 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.840
 scored 3 you are voiced 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.000
 cinema not only cinema tv series cartoons 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.279
 children to such a life well, how come 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.470
 so peculiar when I graduated 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.230
 my master alexan sergey cuttings 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.539
 brought me into this case later 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.850
 various people appeared and so 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.739
 go-go acting so download 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.559
 yes of course vgik finished with liters of blood 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.480
 sentries need here's a list of your works on 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 really impressive hobbit i 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.809
 frankenstein twilight turtle ninja 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.989
 American Pie 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.600
 reveal the secret of which of the actors and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.000
 voiced wow what's your for example well 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.649
 as I voiced many actors to you so 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.899
 I will say that here you call once 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.300
 of course they know significant such things there 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 like a hobbit here's an american pie me 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 always ask to be honest I donâ€™t remember 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 Here he has a lot of work a lot 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 after you are now going to write discovery 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 then I'm going to start a new series of battle 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 creek after discovery again afterwards 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 evening advertising and so actually 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.780
 a lot of life remains for this time but 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 small and so let's say there may be 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.189
 some will remember the most memorable 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 but the most significant one I think of course is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.530
 the hobbit is now widely known 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 bilbo baggins of course the actor 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.720
 dubbing necessarily messi acting 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.799
 education 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.409
 I tend to believe that yes of course well 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.630
 there are no special courses 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.000
 for example actor dabizha well of course 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.040
 People come to the young guys come in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.730
 this thing here I became there for a while 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.550
 back directing already 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.840
 that is, became a dubbing director of course 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.580
 there are people but it is very 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.960
 specific thing is the same as 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.570
 let's say not all the same 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.400
 can be like you are a certain gift 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.460
 this is a certain skill to uncover 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 behave definitely the same 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.240
 there are skills that are hidden inside 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.270
 people is the ability to convey the voice that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.000
 actors have to bring eyes of the soul 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.850
 your game and here you must play 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.430
 just like the actor does on 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.950
 the screen and never for a second 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.290
 there are falsehoods she is immediately visible to anyone 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.080
 man and how he approaches choice 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.750
 dubbing actor for the tub for some 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.820
 particular actor is chickpea 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.070
 the same person is voiced in all 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.660
 Filip differently differently so that 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.060
 enshrined artist 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.190
 assigned to the hero ass well there we say 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.830
 here brys welly session did not hear him 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.840
 the anniversary is assigned to him the artist the same 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.600
 the very thing is nonsense pitt and we are alone this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.070
 better always of course of course i think 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.230
 what is right because the viewer 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.200
 still getting used to him 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.630
 Well, as we hear certain hair but in 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.420
 same time there are pictures that i 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.750
 I think but we need to approach we say so 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 from this because the artists of hollywood well 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.050
 and not only others 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.930
 there are french hindus chinese they 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.920
 versatile well fortunately unfortunately not 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.730
 I know how to say it but they play like that 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.560
 what have to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.720
 take another artist 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.670
 suitable that person who is voiced 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.410
 he constantly falls short of him 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.630
 to some extent they are good 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.910
 reincarnate it's not reincarnation 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.830
 the thing is, they seem right to me 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.320
 goes from his role that is, they 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.870
 same age does not find any sheds but 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.700
 its not visible this is very big 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.620
 advantage may be a minus but at that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 same time no one's advantage you 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.020
 sees a friend's hair changes 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.550
 young mature something he waits he 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.890
 even a person can change there 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.230
 man can get sick a little morning xii 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.940
 Richard day well how many hours are there 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:03.360
 worked out already said yes yes who decides 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 what a dubbing actor 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.670
 well, now we have become an artist 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.370
 so let's say that of course customers are 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.950
 make it go already fashion and trend then 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.109
 There are companies the so-called rally there 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.720
 Russian 8 corrector various 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.030
 international and that's it 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.590
 most of the decisions are made by the director 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.160
 dubbing of course he is capable of her well 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.130
 not always 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.130
 unfortunately for customers in the last 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.229
 time who is harder to voice by the way 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.229
 positive or negative hero 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.600
 neo you specifically for me more interesting 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.750
 a good artist to voice that is 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 never mind villain or own always 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.530
 more interesting than a positive hero 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.720
 because heroes they always pass 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.520
 through movies especially hollywood so 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.319
 straight white thread 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 nowhere right lion it can not from 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.020
 this run away and the villain of course you 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.990
 he is multifaceted and suffers to nikolay 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.030
 going through and thinking something interesting 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.190
 of course, then we pose the question 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.039
 more interesting to voice artist films 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.979
 or cartoons cartoons 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.080
 Well, let's say noble thank you 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.470
 ennoble well because it's nice when 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.250
 you come to the company to friends and children 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.979
 talk about ringing this gargamel it there 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.280
 smurf athlete what wisdom some things 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:31.060
 they are much more than warm inside you 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.460
 and they are grateful so let's say submission 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.310
 non-monetary namely spiritual of course 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.349
 these are cartoons I'm on you on the screen 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.750
 did not take off very Muslims pray 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.569
 I'm acting you're an artist I'm also I play 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.539
 inside ghost i'm in a movie i'm 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:49.150
 dub movies here directing 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.400
 I duplicate but a lot of interesting things in 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.900
 or do you need to interview more on that 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.789
 how such a small amount of time 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.090
 no like a small number of hours to 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.099
 day you combine there is 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.990
 the amount of big work there is a joke 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.580
 so and its sounding notes and came up 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.000
 only tails never come 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.460
 on time because he comes in advance 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.819
 so I have time for all the legs such a schedule 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.060
 serious here is a lot of different business 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.069
 and 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.919
 and in particular life and life 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.440
 family so you need to keep up with me 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.740
 it seems more interesting than just 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.979
 sit and watch TV warm already 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.139
 somewhere in thailand need to live full 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:34.240
 life and work seems to me but especially 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.240
 for a man this is a very important moment 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.400
 first that she was rather than her not 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.190
 she can always create this my opinion 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.590
 I told her that's goodbye to so something 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.080
 voice what rocks cartoon character 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.139

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.510
 man no I adjusted to the hero i 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.190
 when asked 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.080
 surprised and clamped even difficult 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.210
 of course because you are looking at 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.610
 character and under it adjusts and 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.910
 thank you so much for the season early 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.900
