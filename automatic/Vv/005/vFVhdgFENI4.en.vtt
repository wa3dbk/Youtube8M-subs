00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 one way 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.210
 Hi everyone guys and welcome this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.900
 new video today I bring you guys 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.920
 the tutorial on how to make a farm of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 sugar canes and it is completely 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.230
 automatic that is, you build it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.400
 let them come back you take the canes 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.720
 you don't have to do with sugar 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.310
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.830
 then let's start right away 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.160
 let's start digging a couple of cases 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.370
 bravo ie compliments we begin a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.559
 dig a little to insert water because 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.960
 how well do you know sugar canes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.949
 they only grow near the water while 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.650
 where they weren't there and we have a queue 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 of sugar canes well 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.070
 once this is done we have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.040
 positioned our sugar dog 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.100
 let's start to do the scaffolding then 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.619
 first of all I would like to do enough 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.619
 nice too with regards to 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.110
 the construction here I would not do a 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.690
 hummer given then 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.700
 oh well for the aesthetic part there 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.050
 we think later 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.520
 then after putting the canes from 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.140
 sugar 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.170
 we have to start building here 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.290
 behind which we make a line of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.440
 material and we begin to place ourselves 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.630
 pistons what are these pistons i 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.960
 pistons will serve to bring down 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.729
 then let's try the sony pistons to do 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.850
 fall to have the reeds cut 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.500
 sugar just grow so that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.009
 let's start by putting the pistons in this 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.290
 way they have to be a block above the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.930
 sugar cane 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.650
 ok once you put the piston 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.030
 we can proceed in placing the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.649
 circuit reston then what to do now 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.119
 make a roof make a perfect text 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.380
 here we can also destroy so much not 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.190
 nothing is done only for 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 replace pistons 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.000
 ok already has taken shape here they write too 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 the whole already formed a little 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.740
 now let's try to embellish and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.710
 automate everything then us here 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.090
 we know that there are reeds from 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.040
 sugar that will be cut 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 automatically before making the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.810
 circuit i'm left to make of 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.560
 automate the collection for which 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 let's take a 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.610
 no for we keep the over and take one 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:52.560
 perfect test basket works let's dig here 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.590
 under perfect in this way and then 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.470
 we also find here to test ourselves 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.290
 we begin to place the hoffers for which 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.330
 we place them this way 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:12.200
 poor or true true we put them 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 we know if when the water and voila there 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.860
 let's get them to bring everyone from 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.890
 a part for which we place lauper e 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.890
 let's see what it brings here and we don't 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.890
 is fine finished so we do so 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.300
 so 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.140
 so 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.620
 let's try to take them all from this one 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.350
 part ok up here now here 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:55.170
 let's put the ces around fa face mo 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:04:00.870
 so that I can never do this 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.750
 we put towards here while the remaining 14 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.320
 let's see if that 's right except this one 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.330
 which all just see the item fall 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.340
 and go to the center 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.490
 the items fall and go to the center 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.910
 is that of the center takes you to the head 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:21.060
 and we have solved this too 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.960
 part or we have automated the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.990
 now we have nothing left but 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.060
 automate the installation circuit 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.190
 in short, then what to do 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.430
 here we can also plug no because there 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.140
 let's put the sugar canes first 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.500
 put the sugar canes but if not 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:46.410
 I put my face like I do with tir 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:51.240
 which we put the sugar canes 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.820
 we give him what now in here not 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.820
 there is nothing we see try to find 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.130
 something we see if it comes as a native 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.010
 so already the automated collection 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.360
 Now let's move on to automate the cut 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.490
 of sugar canes then let's go 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.529
 here behind what we need we need one 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:15.199
 furnace loved the blocks 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:21.529
 premium for now is a piston still one 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:25.459
 time with a sand ball block too 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:31.149
 then saying here we continue with i 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:35.239
 blocks here we need a cold ton 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:37.309
 comparator eh no I did not take that 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:39.199
 price a comparator that they already had 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.169
 food is perfect and we place it in 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.019
 this way that is with this one 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.839
 dig towards here while here 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:54.469
 we raise a perfect level here 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:56.839
 let's put a red son the bitter lo 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:06:00.109
 we connect with the ariston that will take us 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:03.649
 we have everything up here perfect 

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:05.869
 guys now the circuit is completed 

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:08.059
 how to automatically cut the barrels 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.649
 from sugar well to cut into 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:12.709
 automatic sugar canes must 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:15.860
 put in the furnace a stack of 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:19.399
 whatever we take for example one 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.739
 we put the earth stack here is the same 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:23.599
 that the circuit works now though 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:24.860
 we have to test it 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.989
 we try to take a cane from 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.919
 sugar place it and we see that 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:33.439
 automatically as soon as something grows 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.959
 it is automatically cut and everything 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.089
 the rest will end in ours 

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.569
 baskets for which you guys do this 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:43.069
 small plant you leave it like this 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:46.189
 go do the other things you come back 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.919
 bastards go here you'll have list that 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:51.349
 however the sugar canes 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:53.720
 now what to do and guys to plant 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.300
 by now it is determined that is 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.390
 there is nothing else to do 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.530
 advice I can give you maybe 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.580
 extend it fan two different present 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.190
 one on this side and one on the other 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.760
 however, these are things you can see 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.080
 you 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:17.810
 for now we put a nice glass here 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:22.000
 now kraft in English for plus two 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:27.140
 beautiful torcino the beautiful tough 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.480
 but here is one here we leave everything as 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.300
 to the kids this is the little one 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.710
 implanting sugar cane 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.890
 hunger for sugar canes 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.050
 I hope it has been helpful that the 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.480
 video you enjoyed that we at purposes a 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.450
 talk to kids if they did 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.010
 left a nice thumb up if you want 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.580
 I do the aesthetics but I know I don't 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.590
 Fuck an emeritus cabbage for which there is 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.570
 you guys try to make it beautiful 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.280
 try to make the most of it 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.970
 possible I gave him the idea he has 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.890
 explained a little how to do planting e 

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:02.480
 in the boys there is the video was all 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.880
 you like it if you don't have it 

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.010
 understood something or failed to do 

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.229
 something because maybe you were wrong 

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:12.580
 write it in the comments or I'll answer you 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:14.390
 I will try to help you and guys 

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.140
 commented sign up 

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.140
 Hi everyone
