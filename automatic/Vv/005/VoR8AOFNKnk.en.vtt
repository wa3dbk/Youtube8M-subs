00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.260
 practical as it starts bricorama 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.840

 suddenly it started to grow enormously and what 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.400
 that I had thought of as a celebration of 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.280
 day of the child then ended derivative in 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.470
 bricorama 2015 had not been thought 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.890

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.479
 invite media 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.990
 very tiny but suddenly with this 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.200

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.940

 decides that the name bricorama came out was 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.450

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.259
 there were many names but we did not want 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.200
 something very in English 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.600

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.479
 really like the Mexican culture 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.880
