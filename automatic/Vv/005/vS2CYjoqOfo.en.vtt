is a base there's only really one base
here<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.290> big<00:01:28.439> one<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.860> you're

here it's the big one if you're
unfamiliar<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> map<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.270> should<00:01:30.450> be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
unfamiliar with the map you should be

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.700 
unfamiliar with the map you should be
able<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> find<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> no<00:01:31.110> problem<00:01:31.439> even<00:01:31.530> though

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
able to find it no problem even though

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
able to find it no problem even though
it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> pretty<00:01:32.159> big<00:01:32.250> map<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.329> once<00:01:33.600> you're

inside the base you're going to have to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.520 
inside the base you're going to have to
go<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.939> middle<00:01:36.329> level<00:01:36.479> there's<00:01:37.110> basically<00:01:37.439> a

standing<00:02:05.159> between<00:02:05.640> these<00:02:05.820> rocks<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> good

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
standing between these rocks it's a good

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.690 
standing between these rocks it's a good
reference<00:02:07.049> point<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> look<00:02:08.310> off<00:02:08.489> into

the<00:02:08.789> distance<00:02:08.910> you'll<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> small<00:02:09.959> crack<00:02:10.530> in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
the distance you'll see a small crack in

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
the distance you'll see a small crack in
between<00:02:12.180> some<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.629> rocks

right<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.420> can<00:02:14.540> barely<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.170> and

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
right there you can barely see it and

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
right there you can barely see it and
then<00:02:16.310> there's<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.610> can<00:02:17.240> right<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.750> I'll

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
then there's a can right there I'll

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.350 
then there's a can right there I'll
reference<00:02:18.410> exactly<00:02:19.160> where<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:19.430> aiming<00:02:19.640> by
