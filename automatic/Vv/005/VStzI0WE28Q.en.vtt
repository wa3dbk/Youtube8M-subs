00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.470
 it's fun at the site 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.869
 so here today show us how to put 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.429
 the telegraphic arrangement 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.919
 or its drivers all is de rigueur of your graphics card 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.210
 so 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.699
 I tried to be as complete as possible a maximum so 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.150
 bravo m put as many solutions as possible 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 what exists to do it 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.180
 so I started with the simplest 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.050
 to the most complex 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.050
 med percent three years ago that I live with who she really 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.330
 three solutions 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.460
 but thankfully say shown that right now the two years because she is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.330
 arrival in the lead c it's a moment to take another career actually 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.570
 so the same 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.730
 I will not dwell directly on 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.600
 so if this says during this moment it's because most people 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 vignette rock carvin makes a day for me and kraft the message 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.960
 Error 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.330
 bates cartat divorce like that to pharmacy then exactly 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.030
 this is the roundup a little message to France ben I'm happy 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 so that m 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 simply gold we will see start 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.240
 and you type 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.640
 managers 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.320
 so I have the epic pest at the canucks 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.110
 from Beijing and who is there 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.660
 dolphin from 10 countries I think it takes in the control panel to 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.810
 all like that 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 two cases present a party as if charif 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.150
 and so you see that a graph 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.960
 and so there you have the model but in e2 Gaddafi they keep mobile 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.440
 theater man in parentheses wander together 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.150
 inseparable head per year 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.710
 the shopkeeper on it 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.530
 so I have in a bit more of our good faith put forward so that for people 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.760
 who already know past the German vote graphics 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.010
 so welder cydia Fulani noted that the fiba had already made you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.710
 so there we can see a little of its foundation and so here again a little more 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 his training percent the country's debt to all this 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.470
 and so percent 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.780
 promising they were applied you can click his master someday 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.169
 the pilot 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.509
 rahan follow the instructions 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.559
 but then why they have taken into account beyond your pc 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.769
 so here is 6 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.289
 others finally could buy a little bit of light 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.949
 it's in pilot that the most sparkling continuity and master part to 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.089
 play the pilots 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.819
 and I'm in this club 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.979
 so that's the interest a lot the real leader 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.169
 laval that I cook with air 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.009
 who took 5 I find 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.380
 after 1% m 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.869
 a race such person certainly not necessarily walk 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.199
 so that I advise wavering it's my config points like 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.629
 so for 100 e what to do a boost on this site 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:50.220
 you will have to download a question statue 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.639
 for the child click here this or very loaded 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.849
 a small clue of six troop officers to install it 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.849
 in the end you will have to see that 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.529
 she is small cinema icon the detection 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.529
 for the times 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:11.839
 and so it launches you or the internet 6 and so it goes to analyze your pc in fact 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.909
 and so m 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.799
 they are intended for series only as we observed with all that 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.379
 and that you have not reinstall what you are older if the situation 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.779
 present this can find 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.430
 all that is% go 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.749
 under his feet 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.099
 to get to all that for France at pro 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.289
 d'auxerre there they analyze all that 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:39.339
 we think the analysts I showed to find the solution if evra 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:41.139
 for me the one who has a little 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.489
 little more complex 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 so we remember 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.399
 % potok finally a little time what does that mean but its evidence 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.950
 in fact it was so long that it was going to go to the site of 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.869
 watch manufacturer because it involves 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.579
 so not me as for example in some hotels and so you can 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.319
 make his way from the mansion you put for example pilots apart 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.979
 winter 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.249
 in parentheses so we were present she dropped by month 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.569
 where and didier aoun giffords his costs 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:22.550
 info they go on the wall the site france moment on the site of the dfae 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.069
 manufacturers like mayor 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.930
 it's already much more related to the storm 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.639
 because that's expensive in all that while with that was an attack while 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.490
 finding out do you 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.490
 the new harry potter winter 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.409
 here we are 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.220
 our clubs the third I do not have to you 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.469
 or abroad stresses that I have a duty and you 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.280
 his parents went to test his Anglican form africa load change what 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.419
 so that the silla with the first attack it does not work I thought about my 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.529
 config point that a small 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.090
 keystone who go away and not bad at all 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.389
 because it allows to model rossi for all other drivers if 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.300
 what do you want to see what is going on? 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.849
 cake to the users we will say 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.849
 so europe info on my pc 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.089
 this moment so 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.830
 politically loblaw interpret them expropriation su 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.389
 and so here is that the house 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.279
 I do not know too much or not the votes worry about% and 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.059
 to change everything but the engineers 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.599
 but we do not know yet when you 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.870
 leave to the river xingu zahoui 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.589
 so here we are we can see that it is% 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.270
 but look Confederation I can not wait to be there 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.860
 and so present belote to raise graphic reason we were looking for 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.469
 present the graphic hotel name 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.939
 and then here to the right of price download 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.300
 that you will actually install that the world 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.699
 the green crafts driver 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.159
 you see that for example that there are things going on at stanley 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.159
 but here I am, I am like that 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.460
 we are taken so all the special I opened stanley 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.740
 and so logically we would like to embroider your pc the seals the pc is rare 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.740
 barbarity 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.300
 the pronounced judgment 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.569
 not as if this is the case the losc messages to the same screen after a 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.619
 launch and you will not have to manage 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:29.619
 if if you wanted 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.570
 or be open to just this not that the problem 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.830
 so here it is I hope that only rather to dream if the one where you have 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.919
 it was never better if you liked it 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:50.520
 6% or follow them all the tutorial and all that click source subscribe 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.240
 so for a hundred 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.300
 tokes agents also to have watched his videos until the end 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.360
 percent just as young girl on facebook as 6 6% you are a man 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.360
 who is mine on a tour logically under the facebook channel 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:05.199
 So here is 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.169
 east to next
