to do on octane because I've got some

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.649 
to do on octane because I've got some

pretty quick kem strikes and the

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.090 
pretty quick kem strikes and the
quickest<00:00:41.960> I've<00:00:42.080> ever<00:00:42.110> had<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.589> three<00:00:42.830> minutes

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
like 15 seconds on this map and I think

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.840
