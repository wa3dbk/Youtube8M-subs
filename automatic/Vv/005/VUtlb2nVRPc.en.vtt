00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
system here so let me show you some of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.569 
system here so let me show you some of
the<00:00:36.450> features<00:00:36.540> first<00:00:37.500> things<00:00:37.800> are<00:00:38.040> first

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the features first things are first

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.619 
the features first things are first
thing<00:00:38.760> off<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.930> top<00:00:40.620> flap<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.390> see

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
thing off this top flap here you can see

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.250 
thing off this top flap here you can see
it's<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.930> soft

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it's it's got that kind of a soft

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
it's it's got that kind of a soft
padding<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.210> turn<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
padding on here and so you can turn this

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.319 
padding on here and so you can turn this
into<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.960> seat<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.980> idea<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.820> clip

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
into a seat the idea is that you clip

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.850 
into a seat the idea is that you clip
this<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:53.930> the<00:00:54.930> buck<00:00:55.140> gives<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
this down and the buck gives it the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.479 
this down and the buck gives it the
rigidity<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:57.559> makes<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> handy<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.160> seat

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
rigidity and makes a handy little seat

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
rigidity and makes a handy little seat
when<00:00:59.670> you're<00:00:59.789> waiting<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> bite<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
when you're waiting for for a bite the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.549 
when you're waiting for for a bite the
bucket<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.489> here<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.420> 12<00:01:03.960> litre<00:01:04.199> Fox

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bucket in here is the 12 litre Fox

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.050 
bucket in here is the 12 litre Fox
buckets<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:07.790> slides<00:01:08.790> right

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
buckets like you see here slides right

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.039 
buckets like you see here slides right
in<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:10.670> one<00:01:11.670> downside<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> system

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
in there the one downside to this system

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.160 
in there the one downside to this system
is<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:13.950> snug<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.630> takes<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
is it's pretty snug in here it takes a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
is it's pretty snug in here it takes a
lot<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.350> force<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.549> sit<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
lot of force to get it to sit all the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.530 
lot of force to get it to sit all the
way<00:01:18.360> down<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.560> carry<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.420> taking<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
way down in the carry all and taking it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
way down in the carry all and taking it
in<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.409> particularly<00:01:22.860> easy

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
in and out it's not particularly easy

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
in and out it's not particularly easy
it's<00:01:23.580> particularly<00:01:24.060> hard<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> do<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
it's particularly hard to do if it's the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's particularly hard to do if it's the
buckets<00:01:25.350> very<00:01:25.560> full<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.159> bulging

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
buckets very full and it's bulging

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
buckets very full and it's bulging
slightly<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> use<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
slightly so if you're going to use this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.660 
slightly so if you're going to use this
system<00:01:30.000> buy<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> bucket<00:01:31.020> that's<00:01:31.710> dedicated

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
system buy a bucket that's dedicated

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.300 
system buy a bucket that's dedicated
just<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.360> system<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:35.070> really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
just for this system and don't really

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.300 
just for this system and don't really
plan<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.670> taking<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.600> too<00:01:36.900> much

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
plan on taking it in and out too much

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.859 
plan on taking it in and out too much
the<00:01:38.310> other<00:01:38.430> problem<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.750> you're

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the other problem with that is if you're

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
the other problem with that is if you're
using<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> spod<00:01:40.860> mix<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
using like a spod mix in here or a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.719 
using like a spod mix in here or a
boiled<00:01:42.899> corn<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.799> something<00:01:44.009> really<00:01:44.369> gooey<00:01:44.610> or

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
boiled corn or something really gooey or

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.870 
boiled corn or something really gooey or
soupy<00:01:45.329> it'll<00:01:46.049> drip<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.619> over<00:01:47.009> your<00:01:47.189> bag<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
soupy it'll drip all over your bag and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.359 
soupy it'll drip all over your bag and
so<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.570> gets<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:49.770> gummy<00:01:50.040> pretty

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so it gets it's pretty gummy pretty

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
so it gets it's pretty gummy pretty
quickly<00:01:50.840> if<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.020> could<00:01:52.170> take<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> out

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
quickly if you could take it in and out

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
quickly if you could take it in and out
it<00:01:53.369> would<00:01:53.490> avoid<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.820> problem<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.600> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it would avoid that problem but it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.700 
it would avoid that problem but it's
