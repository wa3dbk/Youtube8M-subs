00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.789 

so<00:00:01.620> here's<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.639> back<00:00:02.850> of<00:00:02.879> my<00:00:03.389> soul<00:00:03.990> re<00:00:04.230> dater

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
so here's the back of my soul re dater

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.179 
so here's the back of my soul re dater
ten<00:00:05.220> o'clock<00:00:05.609> it's<00:00:06.089> almost<00:00:06.560> 100%<00:00:07.560> functional

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
ten o'clock it's almost 100% functional

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.669 
ten o'clock it's almost 100% functional
now<00:00:08.730> it's<00:00:09.059> all<00:00:09.240> cleaned<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:11.389> so<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.509> major

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
now it's all cleaned up and so the major

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.640 
now it's all cleaned up and so the major
modification<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.799> added<00:00:14.190> recently<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.880> to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
modification I added recently is to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.130 
modification I added recently is to
replace<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.890> ballasts<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> two<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
replace the ballasts for the two this is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.500 
replace the ballasts for the two this is
where<00:00:19.380> made<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:19.980> weird<00:00:20.490> European<00:00:20.820> voltage

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
where made for a weird European voltage

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
where made for a weird European voltage
I<00:00:21.630> never<00:00:21.869> seen<00:00:22.170> before<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:23.420> 160<00:00:24.420> volts<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I never seen before is 160 volts and I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.070 
I never seen before is 160 volts and I
think<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:26.760> written<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> clock

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
think that's written on on the clock

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
think that's written on on the clock
horn<00:00:28.349> yeah<00:00:29.000> says<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.330> made<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
horn yeah says it was made for that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.860 
horn yeah says it was made for that
voltage<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.500> no<00:00:31.679> idea<00:00:32.160> why<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:33.480> product

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
voltage I have no idea why the product

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.920 
voltage I have no idea why the product
doesn't<00:00:34.050> work<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.780> fortunately<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> could

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
doesn't work here so fortunately I could

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.220 
doesn't work here so fortunately I could
find<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.640> need<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.850> ballast<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:40.129> fits<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.309> here

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
find in need a ballast that fits in here

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.290 
find in need a ballast that fits in here
replace<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.440> tubes<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.430> took<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> starters

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
replace the tubes and took the starters

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.869 
replace the tubes and took the starters
out<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:48.050> try<00:00:49.640> plug<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:52.640> like<00:00:53.640> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
out and now try plug it in and like that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.510 
out and now try plug it in and like that
instantly<00:00:54.949> thanks<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> electronic

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
instantly thanks to the electronic

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
instantly thanks to the electronic
ballast<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.980> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> slave<00:00:59.699> clock<00:01:00.620> so<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
ballast and this is a slave clock so it

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.340 
ballast and this is a slave clock so it
doesn't<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> synchronous<00:01:03.449> motor<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
doesn't have a synchronous motor it just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.859 
doesn't have a synchronous motor it just
have<00:01:04.500> an<00:01:04.619> impulse<00:01:04.920> motor<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.659> thing

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
have an impulse motor so this thing

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.550 
have an impulse motor so this thing
turns<00:01:07.729> once<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.909> minute<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.409> give

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
turns once a minute and you have to give

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.640 
turns once a minute and you have to give
it<00:01:10.710> either<00:01:10.950> 12<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.610> 24<00:01:12.210> volt<00:01:12.479> pulse<00:01:13.110> depending

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it either 12 or 24 volt pulse depending

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.539 
it either 12 or 24 volt pulse depending
on<00:01:13.770> how<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> set<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:14.970> over<00:01:15.210> here

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
on how you set it over here

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
on how you set it over here
and<00:01:17.549> alternate<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> polarity<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> pulse

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and alternate the polarity of the pulse

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
and alternate the polarity of the pulse
every<00:01:21.060> time<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.780> give<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.170> every<00:01:22.380> minute

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
every time you give it so every minute

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.429 
every time you give it so every minute
it's<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> different<00:01:23.369> polarity<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> have

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it's a different polarity so here I have

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.670 
it's a different polarity so here I have
hooked<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.270> circuit

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
hooked it up to this little circuit

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.050 
hooked it up to this little circuit
which<00:01:28.680> P<00:01:29.670> ie<00:01:29.850> xx<00:01:31.159> as<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> guy<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.820> cannot

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
which P ie xx as a guy know you cannot

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
which P ie xx as a guy know you cannot
mix<00:01:33.329> those<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:35.360> nicer<00:01:36.360> rather<00:01:36.990> simple<00:01:37.470> thing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
mix those and nicer rather simple thing

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.590 
mix those and nicer rather simple thing
to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.549> own<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.970> since<00:01:39.180> he<00:01:39.270> already

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to do on your own but since he already

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.289 
to do on your own but since he already
did<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.650> nice<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.340> 24<00:01:42.060> volt

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
did it and it's nice it has a 24 volt

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
did it and it's nice it has a 24 volt
power<00:01:43.140> supply<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.270> they<00:01:45.450> go<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.070> had<00:01:47.070> set

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
power supply and so they go I had set

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
power supply and so they go I had set
them<00:01:47.520> down<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.970> wrong<00:01:48.060> path<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
them down the wrong path so I have to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.810 
them down the wrong path so I have to
wait<00:01:48.960> another<00:01:49.950> minute<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> works

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
wait another minute to see how it works

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.340 
wait another minute to see how it works
so<00:01:53.820> let's<00:01:54.210> try<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
so let's try to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.399 
so let's try to
move<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.460> see<00:01:57.700> what's<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.840> front<00:01:59.140> I'll

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
move it and see what's in the front I'll

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.679 
move it and see what's in the front I'll
set<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.740> down<00:01:59.950> here<00:02:00.250> for<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.460> second<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.090> need<00:02:01.600> to

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
set you down here for a second I need to

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.300 
set you down here for a second I need to
take<00:02:01.869> my<00:02:01.990> two<00:02:02.290> hands<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:04.320> enormous<00:02:05.320> 60

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
take my two hands to that enormous 60

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:14.210 
take my two hands to that enormous 60
pound<00:02:06.610> thing<00:02:06.940> here<00:02:07.420> we<00:02:07.570> go<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:10.810> are<00:02:11.350> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
pound thing here we go here we are and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420 
pound thing here we go here we are and
let's<00:02:15.220> set<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.790> up<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.239> some<00:02:17.010> interesting<00:02:18.010> time

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
let's set it up to some interesting time

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.309 
let's set it up to some interesting time
so<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:18.970> go<00:02:19.450> over<00:02:19.540> here

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
so I go over here

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.729 
so I go over here
I<00:02:20.610> try<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.880> cannot<00:02:22.270> have<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.470> very

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
I try so you cannot have to be very

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.290 
I try so you cannot have to be very
careful<00:02:24.160> how<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> adjust<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:26.680> not<00:02:27.459> things

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
careful how to adjust it if not things

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.220 
careful how to adjust it if not things
get<00:02:28.569> out<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.930> work<00:02:29.200> pretty<00:02:29.470> quickly<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.930> it

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
get out of work pretty quickly and it

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.259 
get out of work pretty quickly and it
doesn't<00:02:33.390> shift<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.810> tens<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:36.269> minutes

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
doesn't shift on the tens of minutes

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.290 
doesn't shift on the tens of minutes
look<00:02:38.110> at<00:02:38.230> some<00:02:38.440> beard<00:02:39.130> are<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.950> here<00:02:42.310> over<00:02:42.910> here

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
look at some beard are in here over here

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.199 
look at some beard are in here over here
it's<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.720> bit<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.080> complicated<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:45.069> have<00:02:46.000> to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
it's a bit more complicated I have to

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.870 
it's a bit more complicated I have to
take<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.720> off<00:02:50.880> okay<00:02:51.880> let's<00:02:52.060> put<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.610> same

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
take it off okay let's put it so same

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.650 
take it off okay let's put it so same
thing<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.269> have<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.540> do<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.750> with<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.709> you-let's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
thing I have to do it with the you-let's

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.280 
thing I have to do it with the you-let's
so<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:59.069> Europe<00:03:00.069> in<00:03:00.250> clock<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.570> counts<00:03:01.930> up

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
so see Europe in clock so it counts up

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:11.039 
so see Europe in clock so it counts up
to<00:03:02.470> twenty<00:03:02.829> four<00:03:04.170> one<00:03:05.790> two<00:03:08.549> three<00:03:09.989> all<00:03:10.989> right

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
to twenty four one two three all right

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.170 
to twenty four one two three all right
and<00:03:11.859> see<00:03:12.720> where<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.930> are<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:15.030> actually<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and see where we are here actually I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.560 
and see where we are here actually I
think<00:03:16.359> I<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.980> one<00:03:21.370> chance<00:03:21.700> out<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:21.940> two<00:03:22.359> to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
think I can so one chance out of two to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.770 
think I can so one chance out of two to
have<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.840> right<00:03:23.049> pulse<00:03:23.470> polarity<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.780> we'll

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
have the right pulse polarity here we'll

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.009 
have the right pulse polarity here we'll
see<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.829> works<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.579> works<00:03:30.850> this<00:03:31.630> I<00:03:31.900> have

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
see so this works this works this I have

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.090 
see so this works this works this I have
sought<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.290> repair<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.100> mechanism<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:33.940> stuck

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
sought to repair and mechanism is stuck

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.530 
sought to repair and mechanism is stuck
but<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.280> still<00:03:36.609> works<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.120> push<00:03:37.359> it<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
but it still works if you push it a

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.410 
but it still works if you push it a
little<00:03:37.570> bit<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:39.220> will<00:03:39.430> work<00:03:39.640> it's<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.090> spring

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
little bit it will work it's a spring

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.060 
little bit it will work it's a spring
driven<00:03:40.780> mechanism<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.590> there's<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.920> leap

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
driven mechanism that there's a leap

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.220 
driven mechanism that there's a leap
here<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:42.400> let's<00:03:42.640> see<00:03:42.760> if<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:42.970> get<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.359> shift

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
here so let's see if we get the shift

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.160 
here so let's see if we get the shift
here<00:03:44.560> oh<00:03:44.940> yes<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.329> works<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:46.780> we're<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.049> the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
here oh yes it works so we're on the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.199 
here oh yes it works so we're on the
right<00:03:47.290> polarity<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.489> all<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.760> works<00:03:49.000> but<00:03:49.150> a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
right polarity so all that works but a

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.789 
right polarity so all that works but a
date<00:03:49.450> hasn't<00:03:49.780> change<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.750> date<00:03:52.959> assembly<00:03:53.590> is

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
date hasn't change the date assembly is

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.099 
date hasn't change the date assembly is
the<00:03:54.069> most<00:03:54.519> complex<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.569> clock<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.049> you

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
the most complex of that clock so you

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.270 
the most complex of that clock so you
see<00:03:56.319> how<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.530> works<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:59.260> first<00:03:59.290> number<00:04:00.160> of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
see how it works the first number of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.559 
see how it works the first number of
minutes<00:04:00.579> dries<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:02.739> tens<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.579> minutes

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
minutes dries the tens of minutes

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.140 
minutes dries the tens of minutes
and<00:04:04.750> here<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.469> sing<00:04:05.769> every<00:04:06.310> full<00:04:06.519> revolution

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
and here the sing every full revolution

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.020 
and here the sing every full revolution
which<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.290> 60-minute<00:04:08.829> gives<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.159> a<00:04:09.310> tug<00:04:09.579> which

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
which is 60-minute gives it a tug which

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.550 
which is 60-minute gives it a tug which
drives<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:11.260> hours<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:12.730> hours<00:04:12.780> go<00:04:13.780> one<00:04:14.260> step

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
drives the hours the hours go one step

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.979 
drives the hours the hours go one step
here's<00:04:15.340> twenty<00:04:15.670> four<00:04:15.849> steps<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.389> at<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.870> end

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
here's twenty four steps and at the end

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.539 
here's twenty four steps and at the end
of<00:04:17.049> twenty<00:04:17.289> four<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:17.590> big<00:04:17.769> gap<00:04:18.009> so<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> goes

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
of twenty four is a big gap so it goes

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.210 
of twenty four is a big gap so it goes
on<00:04:18.789> twenty<00:04:19.120> four<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:20.199> thirty<00:04:20.229> included<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.100> you

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
on twenty four to thirty included if you

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.770 
on twenty four to thirty included if you
click<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.639> don't<00:04:21.820> see<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.449> goes<00:04:22.539> back

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
click you don't see it and it goes back

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.129 
click you don't see it and it goes back
to<00:04:22.960> zero<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:24.389> every<00:04:25.389> turn<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:25.930> there's

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
to zero and every turn of this there's

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.950 
to zero and every turn of this there's
another<00:04:26.199> cam<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.009> it<00:04:27.070> drives<00:04:27.340> today's<00:04:27.960> which

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
another cam so it drives today's which

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.620 
another cam so it drives today's which
is<00:04:29.139> a<00:04:29.169> simple<00:04:29.710> no<00:04:30.070> seven<00:04:30.490> pin<00:04:30.729> mechanism<00:04:31.090> and

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
is a simple no seven pin mechanism and

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.510 
is a simple no seven pin mechanism and
then<00:04:32.440> it<00:04:32.530> drives<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.919> date<00:04:33.130> which<00:04:33.490> is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
then it drives the date which is

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.340 
then it drives the date which is
actually<00:04:33.880> quite<00:04:34.090> complex<00:04:34.449> mechanism<00:04:35.050> because

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
actually quite complex mechanism because

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.589 
actually quite complex mechanism because
it<00:04:35.500> does<00:04:36.930> both<00:04:37.930> 30<00:04:38.889> and<00:04:39.310> 31<00:04:39.580> days<00:04:40.210> for<00:04:40.539> the

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
it does both 30 and 31 days for the

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.260 
it does both 30 and 31 days for the
month<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:42.789> leap<00:04:42.970> years<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.509> it<00:04:44.789> so<00:04:45.789> that

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
month and the leap years to it so that

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.110 
month and the leap years to it so that
one<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:46.870> actually<00:04:47.250> complex<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:48.699> spring

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
one is actually complex and it's spring

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.760 
one is actually complex and it's spring
driven<00:04:49.509> and<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:52.229> spring<00:04:53.229> doesn't<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.650> in

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
driven and the spring doesn't have in

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.589 
driven and the spring doesn't have in
have<00:04:54.039> enough<00:04:54.520> force<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:54.970> move<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.330> because

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
have enough force to move it because

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.200 
have enough force to move it because
it's<00:04:55.750> all<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.229> all<00:04:56.349> old<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> stuck<00:04:57.280> but<00:04:57.639> so<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
it's all it's all old and stuck but so I

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.420 
it's all it's all old and stuck but so I
have<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.599> take<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.840> apart<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.349> clean<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.160> but<00:05:00.310> I

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
have to take it apart and clean it but I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.310 
have to take it apart and clean it but I
think<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.699> will<00:05:00.849> work

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
think it will work

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.560 
think it will work
so<00:05:02.320> hey<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.699> pretty<00:05:03.940> nice<00:05:04.240> clocks

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
so hey it's a pretty nice clocks

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.320 
so hey it's a pretty nice clocks
fascinating<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.729> watch<00:05:06.940> sick<00:05:07.150> like<00:05:07.300> a
