00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
this book were the philosophic questions

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.590 
this book were the philosophic questions
like<00:01:22.710> should<00:01:23.009> human<00:01:23.549> rights<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:24.030> applied<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like should human rights be applied to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.560 
like should human rights be applied to

Afghanistan well studies show that they

to kill humans to an UAV and feel
nothing<00:02:23.830> afterwards<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.360> is

nothing afterwards and this is

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.059 
nothing afterwards and this is

this way what is the objective of war
obviously<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.750> want<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.050> take<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.350> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
during World War two you had to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.059 
during World War two you had to
carpet-bomb<00:03:06.640> an<00:03:07.030> entire<00:03:07.420> city<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.860> take

down<00:03:09.100> two<00:03:09.610> factories<00:03:10.269> today<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.140> need<00:03:11.530> only

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
down two factories today you need only

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.740 
down two factories today you need only

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
to fire three smart missiles and you

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.170 
to fire three smart missiles and you
have<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> 90%<00:03:14.560> chance<00:03:14.860> of<00:03:15.280> hitting<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.730> targets

that<00:03:17.170> has<00:03:17.350> significantly<00:03:18.310> lowered<00:03:18.850> the

that has significantly lowered the

number of civilian casualties all of

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.370 
number of civilian casualties all of
this<00:03:21.700> means<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.180> there<00:03:22.450> will<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.630> more<00:03:23.019> wars

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
this means that there will be more wars

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.770 
this means that there will be more wars
in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> future<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.670> with<00:03:24.940> lower<00:03:25.299> number<00:03:25.750> of

in the future but with lower number of
casualties<00:03:26.820> paradoxically<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.030> brings<00:03:28.360> up

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
casualties paradoxically this brings up

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.120 
casualties paradoxically this brings up
the<00:03:28.570> privatization<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.650> war

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130
