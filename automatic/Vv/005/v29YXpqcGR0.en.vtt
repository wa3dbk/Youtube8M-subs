00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
deck just falls apart and you only have

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.069 
deck just falls apart and you only have
four<00:01:48.640> real<00:01:48.880> ways<00:01:49.119> to<00:01:49.299> get<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:49.899> mean

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
four real ways to get out of it I mean

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.899 
four real ways to get out of it I mean
you've<00:01:50.500> got<00:01:50.740> your<00:01:50.950> triple<00:01:51.250> typhoon<00:01:51.640> you've

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
you've got your triple typhoon you've

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.249 
you've got your triple typhoon you've
got<00:01:52.119> your<00:01:52.329> heavy<00:01:52.479> storm<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:52.990> that's<00:01:53.110> pretty

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
got your heavy storm and that's pretty

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.899 
got your heavy storm and that's pretty
much<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.530> none<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:53.950> your<00:01:54.070> monsters<00:01:54.250> effects

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
much it none of your monsters effects

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.249 
much it none of your monsters effects
work<00:01:55.210> because<00:01:55.750> they<00:01:55.869> never<00:01:55.990> hit<00:01:56.229> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
work because they never hit the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.350 
work because they never hit the
graveyard<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.070> then<00:01:57.189> you<00:01:57.310> just<00:01:57.460> lose<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.880> one

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
graveyard and then you just lose and one

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.359 
graveyard and then you just lose and one
of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.540> things<00:01:58.600> about<00:01:58.810> royal<00:01:59.170> decree<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.740> not

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
of the things about royal decree is not

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.249 
of the things about royal decree is not
only<00:02:00.700> does<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.180> get<00:02:01.479> rid<00:02:01.689> of<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> macro

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
only does it get rid of the macro

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.959 
only does it get rid of the macro
problem<00:02:02.680> but<00:02:02.829> unlike<00:02:03.219> typhoon<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.820> heavy

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
problem but unlike typhoon and heavy

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.389 
problem but unlike typhoon and heavy
storm<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:04.689> actually<00:02:05.200> goes<00:02:05.380> with<00:02:05.590> all<00:02:05.799> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399

freaking macros that they have in their
deck<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.410> mean<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.190> typhoon

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
deck I mean if you typhoon

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.890 
deck I mean if you typhoon
oh<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.550> your<00:02:10.670> opponent<00:02:10.819> activates<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.660> then

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
oh that your opponent activates and then

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.020 
oh that your opponent activates and then
they<00:02:12.020> draw<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.500> macro<00:02:12.830> next<00:02:13.100> turn<00:02:13.310> you're

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.250 
they draw a macro next turn you're
pretty<00:02:14.270> much<00:02:14.480> because<00:02:14.840> your<00:02:15.050> heavy

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
pretty much because your heavy

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.320 
pretty much because your heavy
storm<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.709> MST<00:02:15.980> can't<00:02:16.340> cover<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.760> royal

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
activate a monster effect then chain

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.240 
activate a monster effect then chain
dhokha<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.959> negate<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.440> monster<00:03:54.769> effect<00:03:55.040> then

dhokha to negate the monster effect then

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.009 
dhokha to negate the monster effect then
chain<00:03:55.459> don't<00:03:55.730> get<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.090> gate<00:03:56.269> dokas<00:03:56.690> effect

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
chain don't get to the gate dokas effect

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.750 
chain don't get to the gate dokas effect
and<00:03:57.200> killed<00:03:57.380> oka<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:57.859> I<00:03:57.890> mean<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.280> don't<00:03:58.549> know<00:03:58.670> if

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
and killed oka so I mean I don't know if

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.310 
and killed oka so I mean I don't know if
that<00:03:58.880> makes<00:03:59.030> sense<00:03:59.269> but<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.600> plate<00:03:59.780> works<00:04:00.019> so

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
that makes sense but the plate works so

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.310 
that makes sense but the plate works so
so<00:04:01.250> overall<00:04:01.850> I<00:04:02.060> think<00:04:02.150> that<00:04:02.630> Oscar<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:03.260> his

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
so overall I think that Oscar and his

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.259 
so overall I think that Oscar and his
team<00:04:03.560> did<00:04:03.799> an<00:04:03.920> exceptional<00:04:04.250> job<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.090> death

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
team did an exceptional job in the death

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.490

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
I think that he did a very good job and

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.120 
I think that he did a very good job and
that<00:04:33.660> gives<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.990> pretty<00:04:34.350> solid<00:04:34.590> on<00:04:34.770> all<00:04:34.919> fronts
