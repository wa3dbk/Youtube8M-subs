determine how much speed you lose how
much<00:00:55.840> speed<00:00:56.050> you<00:00:56.199> gain<00:00:56.470> what<00:00:57.430> position<00:00:57.879> you're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
much speed you gain what position you're

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.910 
much speed you gain what position you're
in<00:00:58.089> how<00:00:58.510> you're<00:00:58.690> gonna<00:00:58.750> set<00:00:58.989> up<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.230> pass<00:00:59.409> you
