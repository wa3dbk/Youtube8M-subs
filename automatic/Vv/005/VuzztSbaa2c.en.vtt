00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.870 

I<00:00:05.210> left<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.450> headlight<00:00:06.930> on<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.920> Prius<00:00:08.520> I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
I left the headlight on in my Prius I

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.500 
I left the headlight on in my Prius I
think<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.710> 2008<00:00:10.820> for<00:00:11.820> about<00:00:12.000> half<00:00:12.210> an<00:00:12.330> hour

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
think it's a 2008 for about half an hour

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.470 
think it's a 2008 for about half an hour
and<00:00:12.930> I<00:00:13.740> wasn't<00:00:13.950> sure<00:00:14.370> if<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.610> would<00:00:15.030> drain

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
and I wasn't sure if that would drain

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.520 
and I wasn't sure if that would drain
the<00:00:16.369> car<00:00:17.369> battery<00:00:18.050> which<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.230> hybrid

battery or the small battery that is
used<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> cost<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:25.020> you<00:00:25.350> want

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
used to start the cost but if you want

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
used to start the cost but if you want
to<00:00:25.680> check<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.040> the<00:00:26.520> way<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.700> is<00:00:27.030> recommended

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.219 
and then you can see that the battery is
at<00:01:24.470> twelve<00:01:24.950> point<00:01:25.310> seven<00:01:25.580> volt<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:26.360> have<00:01:26.930> driven

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
at twelve point seven volt I have driven

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.730 
at twelve point seven volt I have driven
the<00:01:27.560> car<00:01:27.799> since<00:01:28.220> I<00:01:28.520> left<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.530> headlights<00:01:30.530> on

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the car since I left the headlights on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.690 
the car since I left the headlights on
so<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.130> probably<00:01:31.310> recharged<00:01:32.350> but<00:01:33.369> I'm<00:01:34.369> not

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
so it probably recharged but I'm not

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.330 
so it probably recharged but I'm not
sure<00:01:35.000> if<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.960> headlight<00:01:36.320> runs<00:01:36.649> off<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.070> small

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
sure if the headlight runs off the small

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.080 
sure if the headlight runs off the small
battery<00:01:37.820> probably<00:01:38.720> not<00:01:39.080> so<00:01:39.920> I'm<00:01:40.340> okay<00:01:40.789> twelve

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
battery probably not so I'm okay twelve

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.410 
battery probably not so I'm okay twelve
point<00:01:41.330> seven<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:42.470> battery<00:01:43.460> was<00:01:43.850> replaced

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
point seven the battery was replaced

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.710 
point seven the battery was replaced
about<00:01:45.549> five<00:01:46.549> months<00:01:46.880> ago<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:50.240> cost<00:01:50.479> when

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
about five months ago and the cost when

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.090 
about five months ago and the cost when
sitting<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:52.149> about<00:01:53.149> ten<00:01:53.479> hours<00:01:53.679> after<00:01:54.679> it<00:01:54.920> has

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
sitting for about ten hours after it has

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.570 
sitting for about ten hours after it has
been<00:01:55.280> switch<00:01:55.580> off<00:01:55.819> so<00:01:56.799> it's<00:01:57.799> at<00:01:58.009> twelve<00:01:58.340> point

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
been switch off so it's at twelve point

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.880 
been switch off so it's at twelve point
seven<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.390> scoot<00:01:59.929> is<00:02:00.110> not<00:02:00.289> under<00:02:00.649> load

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
seven so that scoot is not under load

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.620 
seven so that scoot is not under load
but<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.310> don't<00:02:01.490> really<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.119> do<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> low

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
but you don't really have to do a low

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.660 
but you don't really have to do a low
test<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.549> make<00:02:04.549> sure<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.140> good<00:02:06.409> or<00:02:06.530> bad

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
test to make sure that it is good or bad

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.620 
test to make sure that it is good or bad
when<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.880> turn<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.149> car<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:10.369> will<00:02:10.700> drop

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
when you turn a car on it will drop

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.400 
when you turn a car on it will drop
because<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.440> will<00:02:12.620> be<00:02:12.739> under<00:02:13.010> load<00:02:14.410> probably

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
because it will be under load probably

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.800 
because it will be under load probably
go<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> twelve<00:02:16.040> point<00:02:16.280> four<00:02:16.970> or<00:02:17.269> something<00:02:17.690> I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
go to twelve point four or something I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:29.830 
go to twelve point four or something I
would<00:02:17.989> think<00:02:20.049> okay<00:02:21.049> let's<00:02:21.290> turn<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:21.950> car<00:02:28.840> okay

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
would think okay let's turn the car okay

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.449 
would think okay let's turn the car okay
I<00:02:30.079> just<00:02:30.799> step<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.250> brake<00:02:31.609> and<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:34.280> a

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
I just step on the brake and it's a

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.120 
I just step on the brake and it's a
twelve<00:02:34.820> point<00:02:35.060> six<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:37.250> that's<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:38.239> bad<00:02:38.299> you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
twelve point six so that's not bad you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.849 
twelve point six so that's not bad you
can<00:02:40.130> check<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.910> battery<00:02:41.299> voltage<00:02:41.480> by<00:02:42.320> going

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
can check the battery voltage by going

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.940 
can check the battery voltage by going

you<00:02:54.320> have<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.620> press<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.049> this<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.109> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
you have to press it in so this is the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.259 
you have to press it in so this is the
old-fashioned<00:02:58.070> way<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> check<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.850> voltage

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
old-fashioned way to check the voltage

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.110 
old-fashioned way to check the voltage
you<00:02:59.950> actually<00:03:00.950> should<00:03:01.010> wait<00:03:01.340> for<00:03:01.370> couple

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
you actually should wait for couple

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.569 
you actually should wait for couple
hours<00:03:02.630> before<00:03:02.959> checking<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:06.579> standby

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
hours before checking the standby

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.000 
hours before checking the standby
voltage<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:08.450> your<00:03:08.630> battery<00:03:09.079> so<00:03:11.829> let's<00:03:12.829> just

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
voltage of your battery so let's just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.030 
voltage of your battery so let's just
assume<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.299> waited<00:03:14.810> so<00:03:15.230> put<00:03:15.680> your<00:03:15.799> pro

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
assume that we waited so put your pro

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.640 
assume that we waited so put your pro
and<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:16.970> positive

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.630 

twelve<00:03:23.650> point<00:03:24.070> nine<00:03:24.190> seven<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.920> when<00:03:27.340> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
twelve point nine seven so when the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.090 
twelve point nine seven so when the
battery<00:03:28.300> has<00:03:28.570> been<00:03:28.660> sitting<00:03:29.110> for<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> while

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
battery has been sitting for a while

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.080 
battery has been sitting for a while
we'll<00:03:30.550> go<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.000> about<00:03:31.300> twelve<00:03:31.750> point<00:03:32.050> seven<00:03:32.320> and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
we'll go to about twelve point seven and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.230 
we'll go to about twelve point seven and
when<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.270> is<00:03:34.390> under<00:03:34.840> load<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:35.410> will<00:03:35.680> go<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.340> bit

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
when it is under load it will go a bit

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.090 
when it is under load it will go a bit
lower<00:03:37.480> another<00:03:38.320> way<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.650> checking<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
lower another way of checking the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.680 
lower another way of checking the
voltage<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.940> use<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> meter<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
voltage is to use a meter like this and

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.810 
voltage is to use a meter like this and
just<00:03:44.370> clamp<00:03:45.370> your<00:03:45.730> plant<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:47.430> bolt<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.640> is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
just clamp your plant to a bolt that is

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.400 
just clamp your plant to a bolt that is
connected<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.720> chassis<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:51.210> then<00:03:52.410> probe

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
connected to the chassis and then probe

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.800 
connected to the chassis and then probe
your<00:03:53.680> red<00:03:54.150> positive<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> positive

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
your red positive to the positive

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.410 
your red positive to the positive
terminal<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.820> it's<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:59.700> 13<00:04:00.700> volts<00:04:01.270> and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
terminal you can see it's a 13 volts and

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.820 
terminal you can see it's a 13 volts and
that<00:04:01.480> best<00:04:02.520> that's<00:04:03.520> good<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.710> you<00:04:05.710> don't

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
that best that's good and you don't

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.120 
that best that's good and you don't
really<00:04:06.070> have<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.810> care<00:04:07.810> about<00:04:08.640> whether<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:10.000> is

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
really have to care about whether it is

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.470 
really have to care about whether it is
12.5<00:04:12.390> 12<00:04:13.390> 1/2<00:04:14.140> or<00:04:14.650> what<00:04:14.950> as<00:04:15.640> long<00:04:15.910> as<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.239> get

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
12.5 12 1/2 or what as long as you get

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.830 
12.5 12 1/2 or what as long as you get
between<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.739> amber<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.880> green<00:04:19.150> you're

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
between the amber and the green you're

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.060 
between the amber and the green you're
okay<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:21.450> anything<00:04:22.450> under<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:22.930> when<00:04:23.800> all

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
okay and anything under that when all

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.000 
okay and anything under that when all
you<00:04:24.280> have<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.300> red<00:04:25.800> then<00:04:26.800> it's

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
you have is just the red then it's

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.960 
you have is just the red then it's
probably<00:04:27.250> time<00:04:28.230> or<00:04:29.230> any<00:04:29.620> anything<00:04:30.460> that<00:04:30.700> is

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
probably time or any anything that is

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.410 
probably time or any anything that is
between<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.740> red<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.340> amber<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.150> it's

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
between the red and the amber and it's

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.160 
between the red and the amber and it's
probably<00:04:34.870> time<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.530> consider<00:04:36.040> a<00:04:36.310> battery<00:04:37.170> so

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
probably time to consider a battery so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.970 
probably time to consider a battery so
my<00:04:38.920> batteries<00:04:39.520> new<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.060> that's<00:04:40.240> good<00:04:40.510> you

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
my batteries new so that's good you

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.170 
my batteries new so that's good you
don't<00:04:41.980> have<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.340> worry<00:04:42.550> about<00:04:42.730> whether<00:04:43.000> is

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
don't have to worry about whether is

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.790 
don't have to worry about whether is
under<00:04:43.540> load<00:04:43.750> or<00:04:44.080> no<00:04:44.230> load<00:04:47.370> Green<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.580> 12.5

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
sitting for like two hours after you

sitting for like two hours after you
finish<00:05:08.590> driving<00:05:09.070> your<00:05:09.220> car<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:11.080> that's<00:05:11.730> that

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
finish driving your car so that's that

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.720 
finish driving your car so that's that
would<00:05:12.880> be<00:05:13.320> my<00:05:14.320> way<00:05:14.530> of<00:05:14.560> checking<00:05:14.920> it<00:05:15.310> rather

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
would be my way of checking it rather

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.510 
would be my way of checking it rather
than<00:05:16.170> using<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.620> multi<00:05:18.160> display

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
inside a car they are little different

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.770 
inside a car they are little different
for<00:05:25.449> each<00:05:25.569> car<00:05:25.960> but<00:05:26.910> this<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:27.970> pretty<00:05:28.389> much<00:05:28.600> the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
for each car but this is pretty much the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.650 
for each car but this is pretty much the
same<00:05:28.990> for<00:05:29.289> I<00:05:29.650> think<00:05:30.639> all<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.509> different

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
same for I think all the different

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:37.080 
same for I think all the different

appeal<00:05:54.940> probe<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.539> your<00:05:55.900> positive<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.590> the

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
appeal probe to your positive and the

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:03.510 
appeal probe to your positive and the
other<00:05:57.070> probe<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:58.060> ground<00:06:00.690> and<00:06:01.889> it<00:06:02.889> should<00:06:03.220> read

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
other probe to ground and it should read

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.779 
other probe to ground and it should read
14<00:06:04.300> volts<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.770> 14<00:06:06.220> volts<00:06:06.580> is<00:06:06.729> good<00:06:08.789> you

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
14 volts so 14 volts is good you

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.249 
14 volts so 14 volts is good you
probably<00:06:10.120> should<00:06:10.870> know<00:06:11.500> how<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:11.919> take<00:06:12.190> off<00:06:12.400> the

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
probably should know how to take off the

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.610 
probably should know how to take off the
coupler<00:06:14.259> because<00:06:15.599> you<00:06:16.599> would<00:06:16.840> probably<00:06:17.409> need

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
coupler because you would probably need

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.050 
coupler because you would probably need
to<00:06:17.680> jump<00:06:18.310> your<00:06:18.580> car<00:06:19.169> someday<00:06:20.169> and<00:06:20.550> this<00:06:21.550> is<00:06:21.699> mm

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
to jump your car someday and this is mm

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.340 
to jump your car someday and this is mm
this<00:06:22.479> is<00:06:22.659> where<00:06:22.960> you

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
this is where you

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.800 
this is where you
take<00:06:24.950> the<00:06:25.100> connection<00:06:25.640> the<00:06:26.000> positive<00:06:26.540> and

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
take the connection the positive and

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.330 
take the connection the positive and
then<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.230> negative<00:06:27.350> to<00:06:28.160> a<00:06:29.170> groundings<00:06:30.340> both

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
then the negative to a groundings both

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.000 
then the negative to a groundings both
they<00:06:32.270> recommend<00:06:32.780> naturally<00:06:33.230> a<00:06:33.440> boat<00:06:33.740> all<00:06:33.980> the

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
they recommend naturally a boat all the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.660 
they recommend naturally a boat all the
way<00:06:34.130> across<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.880> car<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.690> other<00:06:36.050> side<00:06:36.670> so

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
way across the car to the other side so

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.120 
way across the car to the other side so
maybe<00:06:38.390> there's<00:06:38.720> less<00:06:38.930> chance<00:06:39.350> of<00:06:39.620> you

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
maybe there's less chance of you

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.070 
maybe there's less chance of you
shorting<00:06:40.610> out<00:06:40.760> the<00:06:41.510> call<00:06:42.040> such<00:06:43.040> as<00:06:43.240> would<00:06:44.240> be<00:06:45.050> a

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
shorting out the call such as would be a

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.900 
shorting out the call such as would be a
good<00:06:45.320> thing<00:06:45.620> okay<00:06:46.490> let's<00:06:46.820> put<00:06:47.270> back<00:06:47.480> the<00:06:48.910> color

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
good thing okay let's put back the color

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.850 
good thing okay let's put back the color
here<00:06:52.870> make<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.900> set<00:06:54.260> is<00:06:54.380> a<00:06:54.530> little<00:06:55.250> tricky<00:06:55.520> to
