attribute is something you can add on to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.590 
attribute is something you can add on to
a<00:00:40.790> tag<00:00:41.299> element<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.680> further<00:00:43.519> its<00:00:43.879> abilities

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
a tag element to further its abilities

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.990 
a tag element to further its abilities
you<00:00:44.870> know<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.199> commands<00:00:45.769> to<00:00:46.519> have<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.699> little

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
you know it's commands to have a little

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.680 
you know it's commands to have a little
more<00:00:47.120> options<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.260> few<00:00:48.620> attributes<00:00:49.690> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
more options is a few attributes that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
basic color so we can type in blue right

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.039 
basic color so we can type in blue right
here

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
here

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.400 
here
and<00:01:09.549> refresh<00:01:10.549> this<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.120> we'll<00:01:11.390> see<00:01:11.420> or<00:01:11.900> blue

get<00:01:18.470> their<00:01:20.020> colors<00:01:26.230> okay<00:01:27.230> but<00:01:27.440> obviously<00:01:27.770> all

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
get their colors okay but obviously all

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.310

colors<00:01:28.640> aren't<00:01:29.150> going<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.450> be<00:01:29.630> in<00:01:29.870> just<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
colors aren't going to be in just the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.710 
colors aren't going to be in just the
basics<00:01:30.860> okay<00:01:31.010> sometimes<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.030> want<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.330> really

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
basics okay sometimes you want a really

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.880 
basics okay sometimes you want a really
advanced<00:01:33.590> color<00:01:33.950> with<00:01:35.290> different<00:01:36.290> colors<00:01:36.620> mix

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
advanced color with different colors mix

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.760 
advanced color with different colors mix
them<00:01:37.100> between<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:37.820> looks<00:01:38.030> real<00:01:38.240> nice<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.560> do

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
them between it looks real nice so to do

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.770 
them between it looks real nice so to do
that<00:01:39.800> let's<00:01:40.220> just<00:01:40.430> open<00:01:40.790> up<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.030> new<00:01:41.240> tab<00:01:41.270> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
that let's just open up a new tab and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.950 
that let's just open up a new tab and
type<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:43.280> HTML<00:01:43.600> colors<00:01:46.330> go<00:01:47.330> ahead<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.690> click

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
type in HTML colors go ahead and click

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.880 
type in HTML colors go ahead and click
and<00:01:48.110> find<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.620> link<00:01:48.890> that's<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:50.120> that<00:01:50.330> all<00:01:50.890> right

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
and find a link that's to that all right

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.860 
and find a link that's to that all right
so<00:01:52.130> if<00:01:52.370> we<00:01:52.460> take<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.850> look<00:01:53.120> at<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.479> we're<00:01:53.750> going

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
so if we take a look at this we're going

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.460 
so if we take a look at this we're going
to<00:01:53.930> be<00:01:54.050> using<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.530> hexadecimal<00:01:55.600> notation<00:01:56.600> X

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
to be using the hexadecimal notation X

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.969 
to be using the hexadecimal notation X
and<00:01:58.720> it's<00:01:59.720> going<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.990> be<00:02:00.170> using<00:02:00.530> three

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and it's going to be using three

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.140 
and it's going to be using three
different<00:02:01.130> values<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.810> red<00:02:03.400> green<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.700> blue

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
different values so red green and blue

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.359 
different values so red green and blue
the<00:02:06.110> first<00:02:06.760> two<00:02:07.760> is<00:02:08.090> going<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.080> red<00:02:09.440> second

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
the first two is going to be red second

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.750 
the first two is going to be red second
two<00:02:10.610> desc<00:02:11.140> numbers<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.379> green<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.549> then<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
two desc numbers is green and then the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.699 
two desc numbers is green and then the
last<00:02:13.970> two<00:02:14.239> blue

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
last two blue

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.940 
last two blue
so<00:02:16.129> as<00:02:16.219> you<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.549> all<00:02:17.150> zero<00:02:17.629> six<00:02:18.409> zeros<00:02:18.799> is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
so as you see all zero six zeros is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.449 
so as you see all zero six zeros is
black<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.609> then<00:02:19.819> six<00:02:20.180> FS<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.780> white<00:02:21.079> and<00:02:21.459> if

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
black and then six FS is white and if

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.869 
black and then six FS is white and if
you<00:02:22.670> see<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.209> put<00:02:23.239> two<00:02:23.989> F's<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.829> red<00:02:25.129> column

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
you see we put two F's in the red column

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.410 
you see we put two F's in the red column
it'll<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.269> pure<00:02:26.959> red<00:02:27.260> two<00:02:28.219> in<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.640> middle<00:02:28.849> pure

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it'll be pure red two in the middle pure

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.509 
it'll be pure red two in the middle pure
green<00:02:29.719> blue<00:02:30.109> etc<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:32.139> then<00:02:33.139> as<00:02:33.439> you<00:02:33.829> see<00:02:34.040> if<00:02:34.280> we

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
green blue etc and then as you see if we

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.379 
green blue etc and then as you see if we
move<00:02:34.730> from<00:02:34.939> zero<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.780> add<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.819> just<00:02:37.819> numbers

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
move from zero and add on just numbers

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.649 
move from zero and add on just numbers
all<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:39.469> way<00:02:39.590> till<00:02:39.889> a<00:02:39.920> hundred<00:02:40.549> you'll<00:02:41.420> see

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
all the way till a hundred you'll see

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:42.910 
all the way till a hundred you'll see
the<00:02:41.780> color<00:02:42.019> getting<00:02:42.230> lighter<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.709> lighter

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
the color getting lighter and lighter

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.059 
the color getting lighter and lighter
and<00:02:43.189> then<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:45.370> b<00:02:46.370> c<00:02:46.700> d<00:02:47.000> e<00:02:47.389> f<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:48.379> you'll<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:48.769> that

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
and then a b c d e f and you'll see that

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.940 
and then a b c d e f and you'll see that
once<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.579> get<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.849> two<00:02:50.780> F's<00:02:51.019> in<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.439> red<00:02:51.680> field

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
once we get to two F's in the red field

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.770 
once we get to two F's in the red field
it's<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.549> purest<00:02:52.939> it<00:02:53.209> can<00:02:53.419> be<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:55.760> black<00:02:56.359> to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's the purest it can be with black to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.280 
it's the purest it can be with black to
gray<00:02:57.139> or<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.709> white<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.879> can<00:02:59.329> see<00:02:59.599> we're<00:03:00.260> just

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
gray or to white you can see we're just

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.649 
gray or to white you can see we're just
adding<00:03:00.829> the<00:03:00.980> equal<00:03:01.370> amounts<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.120> each<00:03:02.299> value

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
adding the equal amounts to each value

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.580 
adding the equal amounts to each value
all<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.079> way<00:03:03.590> till<00:03:03.889> we<00:03:04.010> get<00:03:04.219> to<00:03:04.459> white<00:03:05.590> all

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
all the way till we get to white all

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.879 
all the way till we get to white all
right<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:06.889> they<00:03:07.069> they<00:03:07.489> give<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.909> a<00:03:08.590> list<00:03:09.590> of

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
right so they they give you a list of

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.159 
right so they they give you a list of
good<00:03:10.519> colors<00:03:10.969> you<00:03:11.090> can<00:03:11.269> use<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.629> won't<00:03:11.840> change

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169 
good colors you can use it won't change

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.679 
good colors you can use it won't change
so<00:03:12.530> let's<00:03:13.400> go<00:03:13.549> ahead<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:13.819> just<00:03:13.939> copy<00:03:14.209> one<00:03:14.569> of

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
so let's go ahead and just copy one of

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:22.089 
so let's go ahead and just copy one of
those<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.200> our<00:03:15.230> document<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:21.739> go<00:03:21.889> ahead<00:03:21.979> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
those to our document so go ahead and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.409 
those to our document so go ahead and
put<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> number<00:03:22.579> sign<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.299> front<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.599> that<00:03:23.739> and

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
put a number sign in front of that and

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.719 
put a number sign in front of that and
save<00:03:26.419> that<00:03:26.659> and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:27.470> let's<00:03:27.739> go<00:03:27.919> back<00:03:27.949> to<00:03:28.430> ours

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
save that and then let's go back to ours

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.080 
save that and then let's go back to ours
and<00:03:29.150> refresh<00:03:30.310> okay<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:31.370> now<00:03:31.639> we<00:03:31.699> don't<00:03:31.939> have

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and refresh okay so now we don't have

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.839 
and refresh okay so now we don't have
just<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.659> dark<00:03:33.470> blue<00:03:33.769> we<00:03:33.949> have<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.129> nice<00:03:34.400> smooth

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
just a dark blue we have a nice smooth

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.909 
just a dark blue we have a nice smooth
blue<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.449> we<00:03:35.959> see<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.229> has<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.379> little<00:03:36.709> bit<00:03:36.799> of

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
blue and we see it has a little bit of

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.429 
blue and we see it has a little bit of
green<00:03:37.159> in<00:03:37.189> there<00:03:38.650> okay<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.040> now<00:03:40.870> let's<00:03:41.870> put<00:03:42.290> a

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
green in there okay so now let's put a

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.640 
green in there okay so now let's put a
text<00:03:42.889> color<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.400> write<00:03:43.819> text<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.599> put<00:03:45.530> an

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
text color so just write text and put an

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.580 
text color so just write text and put an
equal<00:03:46.009> sign<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.489> again<00:03:47.359> we<00:03:47.659> can<00:03:47.870> write<00:03:48.379> out

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
equal sign and again we can write out

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.619 
equal sign and again we can write out
our<00:03:48.739> basic<00:03:49.340> colors<00:03:50.439> and<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:53.090> will<00:03:53.239> turn<00:03:53.449> it

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
our basic colors and that will turn it

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.429 
our basic colors and that will turn it
green<00:03:53.659> if<00:03:54.139> you<00:03:54.169> can<00:03:54.290> see<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:55.930> or<00:03:56.930> let's<00:03:57.139> try

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
green if you can see that or let's try

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.030 
green if you can see that or let's try
white

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.130 

okay<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.670> we<00:04:03.820> want<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.060> more<00:04:04.300> advanced<00:04:04.660> text

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
okay and if we want a more advanced text

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.550 
okay and if we want a more advanced text
color<00:04:05.350> than<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.950> use<00:04:06.190> this<00:04:06.400> hexadecimal

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
color than we can use this hexadecimal

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
color than we can use this hexadecimal
notation<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:10.290> obviously<00:04:11.290> we<00:04:11.710> can<00:04:11.740> still<00:04:12.280> have

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
notation and obviously we can still have

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.930 
notation and obviously we can still have
the<00:04:12.790> two<00:04:13.360> basic<00:04:13.870> colors<00:04:14.230> you<00:04:14.680> know<00:04:14.830> six<00:04:15.340> FS<00:04:15.790> is

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
the two basic colors you know six FS is

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.410 
the two basic colors you know six FS is
going<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.990> stand<00:04:17.200> for<00:04:17.350> white<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.090> can

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
going to stand for white so you can

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.350 
going to stand for white so you can
still<00:04:19.690> have<00:04:19.840> basic<00:04:20.260> colors<00:04:20.590> using<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.360> it's

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
still have basic colors using this it's

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.750 
still have basic colors using this it's
just<00:04:22.480> whatever<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.440> prefer<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.880> use<00:04:25.590> also

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
just whatever you prefer to use also

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.740 
just whatever you prefer to use also
capitalization<00:04:27.760> does<00:04:27.970> not<00:04:28.210> matter<00:04:28.510> in<00:04:28.720> here

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
capitalization does not matter in here

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.750 
capitalization does not matter in here
all<00:04:31.750> right<00:04:32.050> let's<00:04:32.230> talk<00:04:32.380> about<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.860> background

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
all right let's talk about a background

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.560 
all right let's talk about a background
image<00:04:34.680> so<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:35.920> we<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.370> type<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.790> background

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
image so if we just type in background

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.730 
image so if we just type in background
right<00:04:38.050> here<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.650> hit<00:04:39.520> equals<00:04:40.260> then<00:04:41.260> we<00:04:41.500> can

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
right here and hit equals then we can

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.910 
right here and hit equals then we can
put<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.580> source<00:04:42.850> of<00:04:43.120> our<00:04:43.540> image<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.560> have

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
put the source of our image so I have

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.940 
put the source of our image so I have
one<00:04:45.190> called<00:04:45.970> grass<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.810> if<00:04:47.170> it's<00:04:47.350> in<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.650> same

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
one called grass and if it's in the same

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.590 
one called grass and if it's in the same
location<00:04:48.640> which<00:04:49.510> this<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:51.060> then<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.240> can<00:04:52.390> go

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
location which this is then you can go

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.500 
location which this is then you can go
ahead<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:53.050> write<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.770> down<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.280> then

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
ahead and just write it down and then

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.600 
ahead and just write it down and then
include<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.830> extension<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.560> save<00:04:59.980> that<00:05:00.310> and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
include the extension so save that and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.690 
include the extension so save that and
refresh<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.810> now<00:05:01.990> we'll<00:05:02.170> see<00:05:02.470> it<00:05:02.740> is<00:05:03.520> the

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
refresh and now we'll see it is the

right there if your image is not in the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
same location then you're gonna have to

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.260 
same location then you're gonna have to
copy<00:05:37.840> the<00:05:38.230> whole<00:05:38.560> Earl<00:05:38.860> so<00:05:39.310> if<00:05:39.520> we<00:05:39.700> go<00:05:39.910> into

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
copy the whole Earl so if we go into

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.110 
copy the whole Earl so if we go into
here<00:05:40.780> find<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:42.010> image<00:05:44.400> let's<00:05:45.400> use<00:05:45.670> this<00:05:45.910> one

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
here find a image let's use this one

alright let's save this all right so we

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.410 
alright let's save this all right so we
have<00:07:00.500> welcome<00:07:00.920> to<00:07:01.040> my<00:07:01.190> website<00:07:01.430> some<00:07:02.150> kind<00:07:02.390> of

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
have welcome to my website some kind of

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.680 
have welcome to my website some kind of
content<00:07:02.980> but<00:07:03.980> we<00:07:04.130> want<00:07:04.400> this<00:07:04.610> to<00:07:04.940> spaces<00:07:05.510> right

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
content but we want this to spaces right

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.010 
content but we want this to spaces right
here<00:07:06.160> so<00:07:07.160> we<00:07:07.370> can<00:07:07.400> add<00:07:07.670> a<00:07:07.700> break<00:07:08.210> tab<00:07:08.570> which<00:07:08.990> is

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
here so we can add a break tab which is

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.140 
here so we can add a break tab which is
just<00:07:09.410> BR<00:07:11.380> and<00:07:12.380> that<00:07:12.560> will<00:07:12.740> move<00:07:12.920> this<00:07:13.220> down<00:07:13.460> one

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.150 
just BR and that will move this down one

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.500 
just BR and that will move this down one
line<00:07:14.390> so<00:07:14.840> this<00:07:15.620> is<00:07:15.830> a<00:07:15.860> new<00:07:16.160> line<00:07:16.400> we<00:07:17.180> can<00:07:17.390> add

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
line so this is a new line we can add

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.630 
line so this is a new line we can add
another<00:07:17.630> one<00:07:17.930> of<00:07:18.140> these<00:07:19.660> and<00:07:21.250> it<00:07:22.250> will<00:07:22.430> add<00:07:22.610> it

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:22.640 
another one of these and it will add it

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.300 
another one of these and it will add it
another<00:07:23.330> line<00:07:23.600> down<00:07:23.900> and<00:07:24.860> then<00:07:26.500> again<00:07:27.500> and<00:07:27.770> etc

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
another line down and then again and etc

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.790 
another line down and then again and etc
just<00:07:28.760> keep<00:07:29.000> adding<00:07:29.360> these<00:07:29.480> and<00:07:30.170> it<00:07:30.410> will<00:07:30.560> add<00:07:30.770> a

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
just keep adding these and it will add a

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.760 
just keep adding these and it will add a
new<00:07:31.130> line<00:07:31.370> to<00:07:31.430> your<00:07:31.790> code<00:07:32.290> and<00:07:33.290> again<00:07:33.380> these

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:33.770 
new line to your code and again these

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:40.390 
new line to your code and again these
can<00:07:34.040> be<00:07:35.920> like<00:07:36.920> this<00:07:37.280> or<00:07:37.730> if<00:07:38.300> you<00:07:38.480> want<00:07:38.510> to<00:07:39.400> do

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
can be like this or if you want to do

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.220 
can be like this or if you want to do
that<00:07:41.770> whatever<00:07:42.770> helps<00:07:43.160> you<00:07:43.220> realize<00:07:43.990> how<00:07:44.990> your

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.230 
that whatever helps you realize how your

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.840 
that whatever helps you realize how your
code<00:07:45.800> is<00:07:46.070> set<00:07:46.340> up<00:07:46.870> so<00:07:47.870> for<00:07:48.080> example<00:07:48.500> this<00:07:48.850> would

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:49.850 
code is set up so for example this would

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.940 
code is set up so for example this would
probably<00:07:50.120> make<00:07:50.510> the<00:07:50.660> most<00:07:50.870> sense<00:07:51.140> and<00:07:51.410> that

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:51.950 
probably make the most sense and that

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.680
