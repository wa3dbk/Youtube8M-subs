00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
up in that one man role is because he is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.690 
up in that one man role is because he is
so<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> air<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:05.189> not<00:01:05.339> used<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so good in the air and I'm not used to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.640 
so good in the air and I'm not used to
that<00:01:05.820> style<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> play<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> crossing<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
that style of play of crossing it in and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.370 
that style of play of crossing it in and
getting<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> strikers<00:01:09.600> head<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.140> more

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
getting on the strikers head it's more

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
getting on the strikers head it's more
the<00:01:10.650> way<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.979> likes<00:01:11.189> players<00:01:11.460> more<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the way that I likes players more on the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.260 
the way that I likes players more on the
ground<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.549> striker<00:01:14.880> really

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
ground but the only other striker really

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
ground but the only other striker really
that<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> had<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> replace<00:01:15.960> Darren<00:01:16.320> Mattocks

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that I had to replace Darren Mattocks

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.710 
that I had to replace Darren Mattocks
because<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.280> injured<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:18.150> grant<00:01:18.479> holt

going to stick another defender at the
back<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.680> play<00:02:04.890> attacking<00:02:05.250> football

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
back I like to play attacking football

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.880 
back I like to play attacking football
and<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.810> how<00:02:06.899> many<00:02:06.960> goals<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.380> can<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.860> one

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and see how many goals we can get in one

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.469 
and see how many goals we can get in one
game<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.399> also<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> makes<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> content<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
game and also it makes the content a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.669 
game and also it makes the content a
little<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.869> interesting<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.500> guys

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
little bit more interesting for you guys

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.110 
little bit more interesting for you guys
but<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> does<00:02:11.459> actually<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.879> into<00:02:12.000> halftime<00:02:12.209> at

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
but it does actually go into halftime at

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.780 
but it does actually go into halftime at
one-nil<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.690> Norwich<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.459> thought<00:02:15.640> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
one-nil to Norwich and I thought that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.479 
one-nil to Norwich and I thought that
was<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.090> pretty<00:02:16.150> damn<00:02:16.569> nice<00:02:16.780> result<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:18.250> you

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
was a pretty damn nice result but you

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.399 
was a pretty damn nice result but you
guys<00:02:18.580> have<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.819> remember<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.360> at<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.140> point

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.039 
and it was a really cracking shot as
well<00:02:54.879> there<00:02:55.150> wasn't<00:02:55.269> too<00:02:55.420> much<00:02:55.540> power<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:55.930> it

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
well there wasn't too much power on it

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.530 
well there wasn't too much power on it
but<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.440> was<00:02:56.590> placed<00:02:56.859> to<00:02:57.129> such<00:02:57.609> precision<00:02:58.000> that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
but it was placed to such precision that

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.140 
but it was placed to such precision that
who<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:58.870> went<00:02:58.989> in<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.349> really<00:02:59.890> did<00:03:00.040> well<00:03:00.220> and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
who just went in it really did well and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.780 
who just went in it really did well and
then<00:03:01.629> basically<00:03:02.159> what<00:03:03.159> I'm<00:03:03.250> trying<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.489> do<00:03:03.609> now

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
then basically what I'm trying to do now

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.869 
then basically what I'm trying to do now
is<00:03:04.109> because<00:03:05.109> Pilkington<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.099> injured<00:03:06.459> I'm

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
is because Pilkington is injured I'm

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.280 
is because Pilkington is injured I'm
just<00:03:07.000> going<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.209> replace<00:03:07.510> him<00:03:07.659> with<00:03:07.720> Snodgrass

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
just going to replace him with Snodgrass

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.599 
just going to replace him with Snodgrass
but<00:03:08.500> what<00:03:08.590> I'm<00:03:08.680> going<00:03:08.799> to<00:03:08.829> do<00:03:08.980> in<00:03:09.069> future<00:03:09.250> is

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
but what I'm going to do in future is

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.759 
but what I'm going to do in future is
replace<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.390> lot<00:03:10.690> more<00:03:10.840> players<00:03:11.140> around<00:03:11.620> the

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
replace a lot more players around the

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.949 
replace a lot more players around the
70th<00:03:12.220> or<00:03:12.459> 80th<00:03:12.819> minute<00:03:12.909> mark<00:03:13.239> because<00:03:13.450> it

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
70th or 80th minute mark because it

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.720 
70th or 80th minute mark because it
really<00:03:14.230> does<00:03:14.440> help<00:03:14.620> their<00:03:14.859> energy<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.430> it

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
really does help their energy and it

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.229 
really does help their energy and it
does<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.840> does<00:03:17.760> contain<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.150> next

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
does it does contain it for the next

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.479 
does it does contain it for the next
game<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.049> your<00:03:20.169> player<00:03:20.319> doesn't<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:21.099> fitness

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
game so your player doesn't like fitness

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.920 
game so your player doesn't like fitness

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
girl and then we did actually get one

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.899 
girl and then we did actually get one
nice<00:05:05.080> chance<00:05:05.349> where<00:05:06.069> I<00:05:06.099> really<00:05:06.520> should<00:05:06.789> have

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
nice chance where I really should have

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:09.600 
nice chance where I really should have
scored<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.419> or<00:05:07.750> at<00:05:08.020> least<00:05:08.259> at<00:05:08.740> least<00:05:08.800> hit<00:05:09.430> at

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
scored this or at least at least hit at

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.939 
scored this or at least at least hit at
least<00:05:09.729> challenged<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.539> keeper<00:05:10.949> but

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
least challenged the keeper but

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.159 
least challenged the keeper but
unfortunately<00:05:12.550> Houlihan<00:05:13.270> he<00:05:13.360> cuts<00:05:13.569> back<00:05:13.779> I'd

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
unfortunately Houlihan he cuts back I'd

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.450 
unfortunately Houlihan he cuts back I'd
like<00:05:14.379> to<00:05:14.500> cut<00:05:14.680> back<00:05:14.830> quite<00:05:15.039> a<00:05:15.069> lot<00:05:15.219> because<00:05:15.400> a

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
like to cut back quite a lot because a

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.719 
like to cut back quite a lot because a
the<00:05:16.090> players<00:05:16.300> can't<00:05:16.599> do<00:05:16.719> skills<00:05:17.020> yet<00:05:17.669> yeah<00:05:18.669> he

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
the players can't do skills yet yeah he

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.240 
the players can't do skills yet yeah he
messes<00:05:19.150> that<00:05:19.240> up<00:05:19.300> but<00:05:20.229> that<00:05:20.529> is<00:05:20.680> basically<00:05:21.129> the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
messes that up but that is basically the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.540 
messes that up but that is basically the
end<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.849> half<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.770> two<00:05:23.770> nil<00:05:24.009> to<00:05:24.129> Chelsea

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
end of that half and two nil to Chelsea

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.279 
end of that half and two nil to Chelsea
there<00:05:24.819> is<00:05:24.939> still<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.210> way<00:05:25.360> back<00:05:25.629> into<00:05:25.689> this<00:05:26.080> game

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
there is still a way back into this game

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.140 
there is still a way back into this game
for<00:05:26.800> Norwich<00:05:27.039> but<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.669> did<00:05:27.879> look<00:05:28.089> very

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
for Norwich but it did look very

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.469 
for Norwich but it did look very
unlikely<00:05:28.719> especially<00:05:29.169> as<00:05:29.860> as<00:05:30.819> Chelsea<00:05:31.360> had

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
unlikely especially as as Chelsea had

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.790 
unlikely especially as as Chelsea had
just<00:05:31.719> been<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.139> know<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.439> they're<00:05:32.620> just

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
just been you know that they're just

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.800 
just been you know that they're just
gone<00:05:33.250> in<00:05:33.460> Taft<00:05:33.729> I'm<00:05:33.909> to<00:05:34.120> know<00:05:34.300> up<00:05:34.479> so<00:05:34.689> they're

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
gone in Taft I'm to know up so they're

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.230 
gone in Taft I'm to know up so they're
going<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.020> be<00:05:35.139> really<00:05:35.379> motivated<00:05:35.889> and<00:05:36.240> they

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
going to be really motivated and they

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.700 
going to be really motivated and they
probably<00:05:37.750> will<00:05:37.990> go<00:05:38.110> on<00:05:38.199> to<00:05:38.289> score<00:05:38.469> more<00:05:38.650> goals

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
probably will go on to score more goals

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.800 
probably will go on to score more goals
but<00:05:39.129> Houlihan<00:05:39.430> had<00:05:39.580> quite<00:05:39.789> a<00:05:39.819> nice<00:05:40.029> some<00:05:40.270> shot

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
but Houlihan had quite a nice some shot

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.320 
but Houlihan had quite a nice some shot
there<00:05:40.960> quite<00:05:41.199> a<00:05:41.229> nice<00:05:41.379> attempt<00:05:41.740> at<00:05:41.860> goal<00:05:42.039> I

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
there quite a nice attempt at goal I

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.159 
there quite a nice attempt at goal I
think<00:05:43.330> check<00:05:43.569> would<00:05:43.719> have<00:05:43.750> had<00:05:43.899> it<00:05:43.990> covered

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
think check would have had it covered

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.040 
think check would have had it covered
but<00:05:44.830> in<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.189> 57th<00:05:45.939> minute<00:05:46.029> drawn<00:05:46.629> math<00:05:46.870> two

but in the 57th minute drawn math two
sets<00:05:47.349> up<00:05:47.620> he<00:05:48.399> sets<00:05:48.639> up<00:05:48.729> Fernando<00:05:49.120> Torres<00:05:49.360> for

sets up he sets up Fernando Torres for

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.740 
sets up he sets up Fernando Torres for
an<00:05:50.319> easy<00:05:50.740> tap-in<00:05:51.099> and<00:05:51.520> i<00:05:51.879> have<00:05:52.089> seen<00:05:52.360> torres

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
an easy tap-in and i have seen torres

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.070 
an easy tap-in and i have seen torres
miss<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.409> most<00:05:54.370> earnest<00:05:54.759> happens<00:05:55.089> before<00:05:55.270> so

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
miss the most earnest happens before so

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.139 
miss the most earnest happens before so
I<00:05:56.110> was<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.409> little<00:05:56.589> bit<00:05:56.979> dubious<00:05:57.189> of<00:05:57.639> whether<00:05:58.060> he

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:58.149 
I was a little bit dubious of whether he

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.240 
I was a little bit dubious of whether he
would<00:05:58.270> actually<00:05:58.419> score<00:05:58.779> that<00:05:59.189> but<00:06:00.189> anyway

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
would actually score that but anyway

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.999 
would actually score that but anyway
guys<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:00.969> Houlihan<00:06:01.599> gets<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.990> ball<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.529> he

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
guys so Houlihan gets the ball and he

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.579 
guys so Houlihan gets the ball and he
passes<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:03.610> down<00:06:03.759> to<00:06:03.909> it<00:06:04.029> derby<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:05.229> then<00:06:05.439> it's

00:06:05.579 --> 00:06:05.589 
passes it down to it derby and then it's

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.429 
passes it down to it derby and then it's
okay<00:06:05.889> he<00:06:06.009> does<00:06:06.129> what<00:06:06.279> he<00:06:06.339> does<00:06:06.370> best<00:06:06.669> and<00:06:07.439> he

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
basically skips past defenders very

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.059 
basically skips past defenders very
easily<00:06:10.479> and<00:06:10.750> then<00:06:11.199> he<00:06:11.349> there's<00:06:11.770> actually<00:06:12.039> a

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
easily and then he there's actually a

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.800 
easily and then he there's actually a
chelsea<00:06:12.520> player<00:06:12.639> on<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:12.879> team<00:06:13.149> called<00:06:13.479> Romeo

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
chelsea player on that team called Romeo

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.050 
chelsea player on that team called Romeo
and<00:06:14.139> Romeo's<00:06:14.800> 19<00:06:15.219> years<00:06:15.430> old<00:06:15.550> and<00:06:15.909> he's

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
and Romeo's 19 years old and he's

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.519 
and Romeo's 19 years old and he's
central<00:06:16.419> defensive<00:06:16.689> midfielder<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.349> he<00:06:17.409> is

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
central defensive midfielder and he is

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.019 
central defensive midfielder and he is
really<00:06:17.649> a<00:06:17.770> key<00:06:18.069> player<00:06:18.279> for<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:18.490> future<00:06:18.849> I

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
really a key player for the future I

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.550 
really a key player for the future I
think<00:06:19.449> he's<00:06:19.569> going<00:06:19.689> to<00:06:19.750> be<00:06:19.870> really<00:06:20.199> good<00:06:20.349> in

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
think he's going to be really good in

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.700 
think he's going to be really good in
the<00:06:20.680> future<00:06:21.009> for<00:06:21.219> for<00:06:21.580> Chelsea<00:06:22.080> but<00:06:23.080> yes<00:06:23.349> only

Norwich<00:06:25.449> will<00:06:25.599> have<00:06:25.750> any<00:06:25.960> chance<00:06:26.289> of<00:06:26.529> coming

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009
