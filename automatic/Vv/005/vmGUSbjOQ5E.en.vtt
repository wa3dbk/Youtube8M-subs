American<00:01:01.100> car<00:01:01.309> racers<00:01:01.699> don't<00:01:01.909> really<00:01:02.210> get

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.399 

roaming<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.940> Pacific<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> good<00:01:06.870> car<00:01:07.110> cuz

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
roaming the Pacific so a good car cuz

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.230 
roaming the Pacific so a good car cuz
they<00:01:07.740> were<00:01:07.800> cheaper<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.610> they're<00:01:08.880> easy<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
they were cheaper and they're easy to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
they were cheaper and they're easy to
maintain<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.290> run<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.040> OPM's<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.700> high

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
maintain we don't run the OPM's as high

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.360 
maintain we don't run the OPM's as high
as<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:12.840> actual<00:01:13.080> motorcycle<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
as they would in an actual motorcycle so

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.550 
as they would in an actual motorcycle so
the<00:01:14.520> engines<00:01:14.880> last<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.390> while<00:01:15.570> without<00:01:15.930> looking

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the engines last a while without looking

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.930 
the engines last a while without looking
over<00:01:16.800> them<00:01:18.950> usually<00:01:19.950> we<00:01:20.280> shift<00:01:20.520> gears<00:01:20.610> at

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
over them usually we shift gears at

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.880 
over them usually we shift gears at
about<00:01:21.170> thirteen<00:01:22.170> five

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
about thirteen five

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
about thirteen five
it's<00:01:23.160> the<00:01:23.310> bikes<00:01:23.550> turn<00:01:23.760> about<00:01:24.000> sixteen<00:01:24.540> five

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's the bikes turn about sixteen five

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.950 
it's the bikes turn about sixteen five
so<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.800> engines<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.310> last<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.850> longer

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.990 

it's<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.650> good<00:01:30.800> teaching<00:01:31.190> tool<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.520> helps<00:01:31.670> you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
it's a good teaching tool it helps you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.480 
it's a good teaching tool it helps you
learn<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:32.780> down<00:01:33.110> forests<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.830> how<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.100> wings

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
learn how down forests and how the wings

in<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> car<00:02:01.130> would<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:02.300> a<00:02:02.450> big<00:02:02.690> step

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
in the car would have so it's a big step

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.850 
in the car would have so it's a big step
from<00:02:03.800> speed<00:02:04.399> grip<00:02:04.820> braking<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:06.259> tracks<00:02:06.590> are<00:02:06.830> a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
from speed grip braking the tracks are a

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.050 
from speed grip braking the tracks are a
lot<00:02:07.040> bigger<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.520> tracks<00:02:07.790> are<00:02:07.940> more

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
lot bigger the tracks are more

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.860 
lot bigger the tracks are more
complicated<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.759> big<00:02:11.060> step<00:02:11.300> encoding

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
complicated and it's a big step encoding

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.020 
complicated and it's a big step encoding
this<00:02:12.470> is<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.709> best<00:02:12.980> teaching<00:02:13.459> tool<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.880> my

this is the best teaching tool in my

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.750 
this is the best teaching tool in my
career<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.630> far<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.430> helped<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
career so far and it's really helped a

career so far and it's really helped a
lot<00:02:18.850> Willow<00:02:19.850> Springs<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:20.810> good

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
lot Willow Springs is a very good

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.110 
lot Willow Springs is a very good
learning<00:02:21.350> track<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.890> very<00:02:21.950> challenging<00:02:22.340> there

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
learning track is very challenging there

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.610 
learning track is very challenging there
are<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.239> lot<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.390> fast<00:02:23.720> tunes<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.380> need<00:02:24.530> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
are a lot of fast tunes that you need to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.650 
are a lot of fast tunes that you need to
understand<00:02:25.160> there's<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.670> lot<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:26.090> uphill

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
understand there's a lot of uphill

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.680 
understand there's a lot of uphill
downhill<00:02:26.980> elevation<00:02:27.980> changes

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.440 

a<00:02:32.190> lot<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> tunes<00:02:33.520> are<00:02:33.730> banked<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.330> then

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
a lot of the tunes are banked and then

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.060 
a lot of the tunes are banked and then
they<00:02:34.600> flatten<00:02:35.080> out<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.920> learn

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
they flatten out so you have to learn

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.070 
they flatten out so you have to learn
how<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.340> drive<00:02:36.640> those<00:02:36.910> tons<00:02:37.210> there<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.840> three

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
how to drive those tons there are three

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.750 
how to drive those tons there are three
tones<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.860> take<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> almost<00:02:39.490> full

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
tones that you can take it almost full

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.450 
tones that you can take it almost full
throttle<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:41.380> get<00:02:41.620> they<00:02:42.070> get<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> little

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
throttle and they get they get a little

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.600 
throttle and they get they get a little
insane<00:02:43.330> but<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.980> guts<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.580> it

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
insane but if you have the guts to do it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.100 
insane but if you have the guts to do it
you<00:02:45.850> can<00:02:46.030> take<00:02:46.180> your<00:02:46.300> full<00:02:46.480> throttle<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:46.990> it's

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
you can take your full throttle so it's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.930 
you can take your full throttle so it's
a<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.380> fast<00:02:47.650> track<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.400> there<00:02:48.880> are

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
a really fast track and there are

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.250 
a really fast track and there are
awesome<00:02:49.210> tones<00:02:49.420> where<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.720> really<00:02:49.990> have<00:02:50.020> to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
awesome tones where you really have to

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590 
awesome tones where you really have to
slow<00:02:50.500> down<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.760> where<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.000> accelerate

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
slow down and know where to accelerate

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.090 
slow down and know where to accelerate
know<00:02:52.780> where<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.050> break<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.530> things<00:02:53.710> like<00:02:53.890> that

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
know where to break and things like that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:06.460 
know where to break and things like that
so<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.340> think<00:02:54.430> willow<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.970> good<00:02:55.150> track

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.680 

it's<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.430> challenging<00:03:07.940> racetrack<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:08.540> it's

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
it's a challenging racetrack but it's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:04:42.790 
it's a challenging racetrack but it's
very<00:03:08.870> fun<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.200> drive<00:03:09.320> once<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.800> learn<00:03:09.980> it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.280 

I'd<00:04:43.800> after<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.460> track<00:04:44.760> quick<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:46.020> sense

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
I'd after this track quick in a sense

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.830 
I'd after this track quick in a sense
but<00:04:46.940> there's<00:04:47.940> always<00:04:48.270> room<00:04:48.390> for<00:04:48.630> improvement

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
but there's always room for improvement

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.960 
but there's always room for improvement
I<00:04:49.320> could<00:04:49.500> run<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:49.830> days<00:04:50.220> and<00:04:50.550> weeks<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
I could run this days and weeks and

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.820 
I could run this days and weeks and
months<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.450> there's<00:04:52.140> always<00:04:52.380> something<00:04:52.800> to

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
months and there's always something to

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.500 
months and there's always something to
fix<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.460> always<00:04:53.670> get<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.910> faster<00:04:54.360> time

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
fix and you can always get a faster time

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.220 
fix and you can always get a faster time
and<00:04:54.780> always<00:04:54.990> run<00:04:55.170> better<00:04:55.790> asking<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:56.850> kid<00:04:57.230> where

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
and always run better asking a kid where

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.900 
and always run better asking a kid where
we<00:04:58.410> want<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.680> be<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.890> racing<00:04:59.250> when<00:04:59.340> we<00:04:59.460> go<00:04:59.580> up<00:04:59.610> or

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
we want to be in racing when we go up or

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.640 
we want to be in racing when we go up or
what<00:05:00.030> we<00:05:00.120> want<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.390> do<00:05:00.510> foot<00:05:00.750> wheel<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.260> a

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
what we want to do foot wheel is a

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.380 
what we want to do foot wheel is a
difficult<00:05:02.310> question<00:05:02.400> because<00:05:02.700> all<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.180> us

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
difficult question because all of us

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.210 
difficult question because all of us
want<00:05:03.570> to<00:05:03.720> make<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> Formula<00:05:04.440> One<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:04.860> at

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
want to make it to Formula One but at

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.920 
want to make it to Formula One but at
the<00:05:05.400> moment<00:05:05.760> there<00:05:05.880> aren't<00:05:06.180> any<00:05:06.300> American

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
the moment there aren't any American

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.380 
the moment there aren't any American
drivers<00:05:07.320> in<00:05:07.440> Formula<00:05:07.650> One<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.970> chances

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
drivers in Formula One so the chances

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.210 
drivers in Formula One so the chances
are<00:05:09.510> slim<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.080> people<00:05:10.380> will<00:05:10.530> always<00:05:10.890> tell<00:05:11.100> you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
are slim and people will always tell you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.520 
are slim and people will always tell you
that<00:05:11.250> they<00:05:11.520> are<00:05:11.550> slim<00:05:12.000> but<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.170> don't<00:05:13.380> work

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
that they are slim but if I don't work

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.170 
that they are slim but if I don't work
for<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:13.980> know<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.220> won't<00:05:14.460> make<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.820> there<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.150> I

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
for it I know I won't make it there so I

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.330 
for it I know I won't make it there so I
have<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.540> work<00:05:15.690> hard<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.170> get<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.010> where<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.190> can

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
have to work hard and get to where I can

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.910 
have to work hard and get to where I can
be<00:05:17.520> everybody<00:05:18.510> in<00:05:18.660> any<00:05:18.990> sport<00:05:19.350> really<00:05:19.530> not

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
be everybody in any sport really not

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.160 
be everybody in any sport really not
just<00:05:20.310> racing<00:05:20.760> wants<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.300> be<00:05:21.450> at<00:05:21.570> the<00:05:21.660> top<00:05:21.870> like

just racing wants to be at the top like

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.800 
just racing wants to be at the top like
