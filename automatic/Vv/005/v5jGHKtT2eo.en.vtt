00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:38.000
 and a little bit of the legal situation that has 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.680
 been with roberto gómez and is that the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300
 success that has been the chabón in all 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.489
 latin america in the whole world and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.510
 are you really separated with 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.040
 Roberto is not a sin 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.580
 it definitely is not 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.130
 I have deeply regretted it 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.620
 tried to come to approaches I have 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.520
 Done case they do not want they are not interested 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.710
 what sadness it gives me because the image that 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.699
 all the people have and that we had and that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.550
 I have 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.280
 not just the chj came 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.800
 wonderful characters is a union 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.039
 strong that we always had for the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.689
 history 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.670
 We were not 24 aired but I already have 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.859
 37 of being the chilindrina is separated 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.450
 of Roberto from his wife not from his 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.000
 neither his wife nor I ever parted with him 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.580
 ruthless 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.390
 certainly not going to tell you in that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 put with you 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.180
 the lawsuit is that at a given moment there 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.790
 they wanted to let me work then I 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.950
 after 24 years I was not going to give up 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.170
 the chilindrina because I thought it was 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.119
 the only thing I could do was realize 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.390
 new strong again that he won with 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.030
 pictographic censorship I think he does not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.729
 goes around the matter what happens is that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.150
 we all feel that the character is so 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.030
 of him I believe as mine he has always been 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.520
 mocked me 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.479
 to his way of being the one that says no I do not 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.340
 I remember 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.160
 you are the father he wrote a script 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.700
 wonderful but which gave the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.700
 characterization 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.630
 it's not even the first one was like that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.210
 character that I did with chespirito in 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.630
 1968 is called mo cocha pechocha but 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.630
 bojan 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.290
 18 years old was a teenager and from that 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.850
 it was a very pretty girl 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.910
 but silly 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:40.190
 according to hernando tells you so but 17 of 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.700
 nonsense and if there are some strawberries today 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.700
 In nothing 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.660
 I do not know how perfect that when the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.340
 legal problems with roberto you put yourself 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.550
 bad I know that today you are taking it from the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.200
 most relaxed way possible but to you 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.120
 It affects a lot to be fought with 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.750
 roberto that happened affected me 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.159
 it affected me and there goes the why no longer 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.640
 I wanted to give interviews again from 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.790
 two years ago two years ago I was 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.400
 bad physically was wrong I felt bad 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.629
 he had just come out of a depression 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.670
 horrible those things I do not like 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.739
 ventilate them because people say if they are 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.200
 stopping the neck once it affects her 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.120
 a lot no no no no but then he made a 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.670
 interview that I do not like me as 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.430
 person because I'm not like that 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.549
 carme always gave joy I felt a 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.540
 bit as bitter as assaulted as 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.720
 annoyed and I said no while I have this not 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.030
 I'm going to give interviews like they like 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.700
 see the macro theme the truth is that to give 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.530
 pretty and leave for many years 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.750
 a very nice friendship right now there is a 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.790
 sort of break as when you 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.400
 you fight with your dad and your mom and that you 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.870
 you separate and then at the moment you 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.420
 they come back together because it's still 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.629
 a family then I still want that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.190
 I still last year I had two 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.990
 attempts to 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.540
 to be able to talk about being able to say 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:14.600
 they did then can not be 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:17.330
 forcing a situation takes five years 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.489
 not simply more of the relationship 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.130
 emotional does not structure and roberto but 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.350
 no friends no more than me with much more 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.390
 that friends that fire the spirit what 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.610
 I felt like my dad many years what 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.920
 he felt like his first wife graciela 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.480
 It was like my mom when I started 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.910
 work with them died shortly 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.710
 time my dad and my mom and the one that 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.370
 He called and gave me advice and everything was 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.620
 graciela back and you are a woman 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.949
 extraordinary as your order 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.560
 then when that relationship was cut 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.740
 for me if the earth moved me because I 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.870
 I did not have dad mommy my brothers my 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.870
 brothers his family 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.449
 I do not follow it 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.400
 until the clear date many people 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.380
 they thought we were even a couple or 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.530
 boyfriends I do not know what the physicist puts me 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.530
 You understand me little boy the right thing 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:20.689
 and for the entity that you want 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.009
 obviously arrange with them that you've 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:27.050
 had approaches but I do not go back to 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.889
 move blacks and has kidnapped is going to be 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.479
 difficult I do not know that you said it you do not 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.439
 you are going to join the television ranks 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.439
 Aztec of emotion 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.619
 let me tell you this in X time 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.190
 we've been in talks we've never 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:47.840
 concretized nothing because I am very special 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.570
 If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do what 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.970
 I really like you understand me that would be what 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.060
 first you ask the first something that I 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.060
 like after something half popular I do not know 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.009
 when I wake up 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.879
 another thing I also like it to be me 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.620
 I see I bring some dark circles nice bodies 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:12.000
 that good 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.700
 this 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.500
 I feel like I've lost a lot of time 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.840
 with the chilindrina and I will follow 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.250
 losing because I love her but I'm 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.370
 looking to do something more like Maria 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.160
 antonieta de las nieves as an actress in 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.400
 I would love a telenovela because 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.840
 I was made of pretty lady be at odds 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:37.080
 I made it from an 80- year-old lady 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.940
 apart from indigenous old woman I liked it 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.870
 he received a prize in new york for that 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.640
 character because I do not do that you know by 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.500
 what because my physical 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.250
 people say no you can not be a villain 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.250
 It has to be pretty 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.530
 but if something comes out earlier for the 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.230
 chilindrina then then welcome to 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.470
 the chilindrina will always remain my 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.470
 priority
