00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello friends here welcome to a video 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.009
 more with levy today I bring you one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.839
 very important information that just 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.490
 exit yesterday about the change 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.170
 in the qualifiers he wants 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.880
 implement rivers in our servers 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 soon we will explain what is 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 because there is a lot of confusion in law or 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.100
 in forums as you read it and so on that a lot 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.690
 people are very confused I'm going to do my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 import this video so that all 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.600
 we can understand what this is 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.600
 let's go back to this 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.410
 the classification will be lived in leagues and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.540
 within these leagues divisions the elo 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.610
 will stop attending less visually 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.410
 It will only be counted when making 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.120
 more making to join people who 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 are in different leagues but with your 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.199
 same elo is the invisible that is going to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.330
 count rush to make this + + making 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.910
 that is to say when it comes to matching 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.980
 now six leagues the bronze league the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.140
 silver league gold league league 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.489
 platinum and the diamond league and league of 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.100
 aspirants that is a new one that 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.410
 introduced within cali there are five 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.260
 divisions to division 1 division 2 the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.239
 division 3 division 4 and division 5 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.309
 what are we going to get when we win a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.680
 qualifying good rather lose it 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.960
 of the league points when we get to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.450
 100 league points we will have the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.729
 possibility of doing a promotion so much 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.799
 to go up in division like going up to another 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.780
 league if we are for example in the league 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.790
 of silver in division 3 and we're going to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.979
 go up to the next division we will play 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.049
 to the best of 3 when we have 100 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.729
 league points if the desire will go up 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.619
 next division what happens if we are 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.509
 in the last silver division with the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.490
 100 league points and we want to go up 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.280
 Gold is good to be the best 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.680
 it will be the best to five game because 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.710
 I say the best because in every league in the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 you're there will be 250 people the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 better than going to do the promotion 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.619
 of those 250 people will be those 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.500
 They rose emission or rise league 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.270
 there are many leagues of 250 people you do not go 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.220
 to play with these 200 people of your 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.960
 league would be crazy they imagined that 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.299
 you want to play at 3 in the morning and 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.159
 of the 250 people there are only 20 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.990
 playing would be a horror to find 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.729
 with those 20 people want to play 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 qualifiers at the moment you 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.060
 you want so he's going to play with all the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.190
 of your flight that's why it's going to be 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.590
 invisible will not be visible to you 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.480
 but it's going to be cold to make you the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.640
 match with the other players 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.890
 which is the aspiring league of which I spoke 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.780
 previously good the best teams 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.150
 55 top but they will have the opportunity 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.299
 end of these did enter into a 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.040
 eliminatory tournament where if they pass between 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.380
 the top 8 of all teams 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.209
 amateurs will be able to face the 4 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.410
 last professional teams the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.989
 pictures at the time of events 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.090
 collaborators in a kind of tournaments 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.709
 where the classifieds will be able to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.940
 make professional teams for the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.800
 championships 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.480
 from rivers thing that is pretty good 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.150
 for these teams that do not have a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.880
 kind of sponsor or do not have capacity 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.920
 of funding just five good 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.840
 friends who play and have come up 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.580
 there you have the option to charge for this 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.500
 they play not good we already know how 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.720
 make the leagues the divisions the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.370
 points promotions the league 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.320
 promotions and so now let's 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.120
 focus on the little details and of 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.890
 those things that says good but this 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.720
 exactly how to do it because I 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.150
 you are giving very ambiguous first how many 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.860
 league points we will win every time 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 let's win a qualifier or lose it 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.270
 no rivers says he does not know the figure yet 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.520
 exact but they approximate about 15 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.260
 league points between won and if 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.120
 loses more or less equal is to say a 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.040
 very similar system that is 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.440
 actually now when we ascend from 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.960
 division or league we will start with 0 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 league points but what happens is to say yes 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.440
 we lose the next game 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.750
 we will return to the league or division 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.270
 previous says rivers that there will not be a 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.280
 period in which you can not download 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.590
 category but that all the games 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.360
 that you are playing in that period in which 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.700
 you go up you can not go down will continue 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.480
 counting on that invisible elo that is 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.700
 call more 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.950
 making rating is to say if you are in the 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.290
 golden league you just went up to the first 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.330
 division of the gold league and you start to 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.879
 play in that period of time in the 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.310
 which you can not lose league and lose 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.230
 then this will reduce soil 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.450
 invisible therefore when it starts to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.790
 count if you win you will earn less points of 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.010
 league because your flight is lower than the one 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.200
 you should have for that league or division 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.299
 so keep that in mind do not trust 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.310
 if you're in a head and go up 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.409
 division or league and as in that period 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.120
 can not go down we do not care to lose or 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.979
 Win backwards try to win more 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.410
 because the more I win and more 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.780
 invisible you have more league points 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.820
 you will win and it will be easier for you to ascend 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.710
 to the next division or league what is going to 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.870
 happen when you have these games of 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.120
 promotion to go up to the next 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.160
 division or the next league you 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.600
 you will face the same people who 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400
 are promoting your league or 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.650
 division then rivers says that for now no 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.720
 that it would not be a bad idea to implement it in 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.090
 a future but currently it's not going to be 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.039
 so when they put it on it happens to you 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.590
 your qualifier you know that you have 100 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.870
 league points and therefore you play 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.970
 life three games to five if you're 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.470
 after you communicate with your 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.540
 teammates saying what 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.520
 you are in that situation that you need 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.920
 win that is actually a help and that 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.450
 play hard to be able to ascend 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.620
 because maybe your companions 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.420
 of equipment are not in the same 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.130
 situation and they will not give the chest 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.990
 how are you going to do to be able to 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.940
 move up from division or league this to me 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.760
 personally I do not like it very much because of 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.650
 that people tend to be not very supportive in 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.690
 this sense and if the problem is yours 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.030
 study alone and you will depend a lot 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.740
 of four more people which at 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.600
 better they do it well and there is no 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.610
 problem but maybe not and you lose 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.050
 a golden opportunity never better said 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.090
 but well we'll see if they go 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.080
 improving over time put before 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.570
 finish I want to make a small 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.490
 clarification about the invisible this that 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.450
 I was talking about it during the video but 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.460
 that maybe not explained 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.230
 well enough and I want you to 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.320
 make clear in the normal items 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.970
 as much of 33 as 55 as of 55 of 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.950
 there was this invisible that is a 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.840
 percentage between victories and 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.060
 defeats that you have had and you 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.430
 statistic is if you have 500 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.380
 won and only 100 lost you will play with 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.540
 better players than if you have 500 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.020
 lost and 100 won therefore in 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.270
 this 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.340
 system of what we currently see is going to 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.800
 happen to be like this one of the normals 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.479
 invisible we will continue to earn points 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.129
 when we win and we will be followed 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.990
 accumulating according to the victories and 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.819
 defeats that we have in order to match 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.250
 We have players who have the same 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.139
 statistics that we this always 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.479
 has existed so that for example we from 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.729
 touches in a game with players from 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.169
 low category according to which you have or 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.849
 players in the opposite team of 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.710
 a lot of category and if you have to 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.810
 face a team that has three 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.759
 diamonds and in your team there are four 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.620
 bronzes and a silver then you have it 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.990
 pretty fucked up because of rule of three 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.449
 they will play better they will have better knowledge 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.130
 of the game better handling of characters by 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.720
 therefore you will have more possibilities of 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.940
 lose that to win I hope that they have 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.919
 it became clear that this is the invisible and 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.720
 good nothing in conclusion this change 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.550
 for me it's the same dog with another 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.770
 collar not having a significant change 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.650
 in the structure of how we will be winning 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.840
 positions have simply changed the 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.849
 way of doing it is to say previously 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.169
 we won they went up numbers and numbers and 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:59.000
 numbers were going up and we're going 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.800
 getting the gold the diamond now 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.569
 we will be within divisions we will have 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.520
 objectives to achieve when it arrives 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:06.319
 to the maximum our league points to 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.479
 rise of division or league and so what 

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.610
 will make it a little more dynamic and you 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:12.169
 obsessing are perhaps a little less 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.639
 you do not have to be seeing numbers all 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.189
 the time saying good is that I have lost 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.020
 and I get off I do not know how much now just 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:21.050
 will lower you to league points but you'll know 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.389
 that will not mean as much as before or 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.099
 less mentally it will be like that and nothing guys 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:28.099
 this has been all I hope you have 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:29.839
 liked that you understand it if it is not like that is 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.699
 at least comments what has not 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.189
 made clear and clarified 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:38.349
 perfectly was born and I saw him see you in 

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:38.349
 more videos, write, give you a hand, chau
