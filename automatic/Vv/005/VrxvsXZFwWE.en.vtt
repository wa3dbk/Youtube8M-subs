00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
things to point out around the bike if I

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.549 
things to point out around the bike if I
had<00:00:34.890> been<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.190> storage<00:00:35.370> since<00:00:37.219> 2007<00:00:38.219> ish

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
had been in storage since 2007 ish

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.869 
had been in storage since 2007 ish
perhaps<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:41.129> before<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.579> but

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
perhaps a little bit before that but

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.410 
perhaps a little bit before that but
probably<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.270> much<00:00:42.450> before<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:44.239> I've<00:00:45.239> had

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
probably not much before that I've had

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.250 
probably not much before that I've had
it<00:00:45.539> running<00:00:46.670> on<00:00:47.670> its<00:00:48.059> own<00:00:48.329> I've<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.079> been<00:00:49.170> able

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it running on its own I've not been able

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
it running on its own I've not been able
to<00:00:49.350> take<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> ride<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.160> any<00:00:50.430> runs<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.850> one

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to take a ride because any runs on one

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
to take a ride because any runs on one
sinner<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> injectors

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
sinner and I think one of the injectors

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.619 
sinner and I think one of the injectors
is<00:00:52.920> probably<00:00:53.250> gummed<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:54.469> I<00:00:55.469> haven't<00:00:55.920> tried

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
is probably gummed up I haven't tried

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.630 
is probably gummed up I haven't tried
going<00:00:57.629> any<00:00:57.870> further<00:00:58.140> than<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
going any further than that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.930 
going any further than that
but<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:01.949> probably<00:01:02.399> what's<00:01:02.670> wrong

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
but I think that's probably what's wrong

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.420 
but I think that's probably what's wrong
with<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:06.080> I've<00:01:07.080> noticed<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> had<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
with it I've noticed that when I had it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.859 
with it I've noticed that when I had it
running<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.450> soul<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.110> squirted<00:01:10.650> some

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
running on one soul if you squirted some

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.899 
running on one soul if you squirted some
fuel<00:01:12.869> down<00:01:13.080> his<00:01:13.260> air<00:01:13.439> hole<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.369> could<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
fuel down his air hole you could get it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.980 
fuel down his air hole you could get it
to<00:01:15.000> run<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.420> both<00:01:16.290> cylinders<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:18.540> told<00:01:18.869> me

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to run on both cylinders so that told me

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960 
to run on both cylinders so that told me
that<00:01:19.080> everything<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> fine<00:01:20.220> apart<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that everything is fine apart from this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
that everything is fine apart from this
you're<00:01:21.150> not<00:01:21.270> getting<00:01:21.479> pumped<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.439> know

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you're not getting pumped in I do know

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.359 
you're not getting pumped in I do know
that<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:24.140> fuel<00:01:25.140> pump<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.650> blocked<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.340> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that the fuel pump was blocked when I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
that the fuel pump was blocked when I
got<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> bike<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.420> I've<00:01:27.570> changed<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> fuel

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
got the bike and I've changed a fuel

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.020 
got the bike and I've changed a fuel
pump<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> different<00:01:29.610> fuel

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
pump on it so it has a different fuel

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
pump on it so it has a different fuel
pump<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.570> Oban<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.579> they

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
pump the Oban can go with it but they

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
pump the Oban can go with it but they
come<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.900> little<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.170> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
come up and there's very little you can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.260 
come up and there's very little you can
do<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.640> as

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
do with them when they're like that as

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
do with them when they're like that as
far<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.659> I'm<00:01:36.780> aware<00:01:38.150> anyway<00:01:39.150> there's<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:40.490> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
far as I'm aware anyway there's that it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
far as I'm aware anyway there's that it
needs<00:01:41.759> another<00:01:42.060> battery<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> battery<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
needs another battery the battery is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.510 
needs another battery the battery is
years<00:01:43.409> old<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> change

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
years old and there you need to change

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
years old and there you need to change
that<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:47.000> took<00:01:48.000> off<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> date<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.110> alarm

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that I took off a date at all alarm

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
that I took off a date at all alarm
system<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> bike<00:01:50.520> because<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:53.280> battery

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
system from the bike because the battery

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.940 
system from the bike because the battery
in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> date<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.570> alarm<00:01:54.899> had<00:01:55.049> gone<00:01:55.259> flat<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in the date all alarm had gone flat and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
in the date all alarm had gone flat and
it<00:01:56.040> wouldn't<00:01:56.280> come<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> removed<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> LAN

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it wouldn't come up so I removed the LAN

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.030 
it wouldn't come up so I removed the LAN
system<00:01:58.140> from<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> bike

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
system from the bike

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.920 
system from the bike
I<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.520> only<00:01:59.670> twisted<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> wires<00:02:00.540> together

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I have only twisted the wires together

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.870 
I have only twisted the wires together
at<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.409> point<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.799> wasn't<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.280> problem<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.790> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
at this point it wasn't a problem so I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
at this point it wasn't a problem so I
do<00:02:03.030> they<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.649> soldiering<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.710> insulating

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
do they want soldiering and insulating

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.570 
do they want soldiering and insulating
to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> permanent<00:02:06.299> job

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to do a permanent job

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.260 
to do a permanent job
there's<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:10.370> and<00:02:11.370> that's<00:02:11.520> basically<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
there's that and that's basically it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.680 
there's that and that's basically it
I<00:02:12.960> think<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.070> those<00:02:14.310> small<00:02:14.850> jobs<00:02:15.330> I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I think if you do those small jobs I

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
I think if you do those small jobs I
think<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.440> get<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> injectors<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.400> quite

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
think to get to the injectors it's quite

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.770 
think to get to the injectors it's quite
an<00:02:17.640> easy<00:02:17.760> job<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:20.060> wouldn't<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.150> surprised<00:02:21.630> if

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
an easy job I wouldn't be surprised if

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.110 
an easy job I wouldn't be surprised if
both<00:02:22.020> injectors<00:02:22.590> could<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.220> changing

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
both injectors could do with changing

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.240 
both injectors could do with changing
but<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.360> last<00:02:24.540> time<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.900> tried<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.380> start<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
but the last time I tried to start it it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.540 
but the last time I tried to start it it
didn't<00:02:26.550> run<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:28.470> his<00:02:28.680> own<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.280> he<00:02:29.340> did

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
didn't run on on his own but he did

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.380 
didn't run on on his own but he did
before<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:32.340> say<00:02:32.550> probably<00:02:32.910> that's

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
before so I would say probably that's

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.360 
before so I would say probably that's
what's<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:34.020> on<00:02:34.140> there<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.800> was<00:02:34.980> nice

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
what's going on there but it was nice

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
what's going on there but it was nice
not<00:02:35.670> difficult<00:02:36.120> job<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.510> any<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.870> he's

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
not difficult job to do any of that he's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
not difficult job to do any of that he's
just<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.410> little<00:02:37.530> bit<00:02:37.740> time-consuming<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.730> had

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
just a little bit time-consuming you had

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.610 
just a little bit time-consuming you had
everything<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:39.990> hand<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.380> could<00:02:40.500> probably

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
everything that hand you could probably

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890 
everything that hand you could probably
the<00:02:40.830> whole<00:02:41.040> thing<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.700> running<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
the whole thing up and running with a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190 
the whole thing up and running with a
battery<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.500> golfer<00:02:44.010> ride<00:02:44.220> within<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:45.200> couple

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
battery and golfer ride within a couple

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.700 
battery and golfer ride within a couple
of<00:02:46.260> hours<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:46.740> have<00:02:46.980> thought<00:02:48.710> what

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
of hours I would have thought what

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.470 
of hours I would have thought what
you're<00:02:49.830> gonna<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.610> anyway<00:02:50.730> I've

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
you're gonna do with it but anyway I've

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.800 
you're gonna do with it but anyway I've
got<00:02:51.690> any<00:02:51.810> questions<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.590> ask
