00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 greetings we're starting one more 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.270
 today's edition in tek world 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.420
 You will see that the iphone 2 is sending 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.790
 well some tests and also the lumia more 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 that microsoft has already launched and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 other highlights does not stay connected 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.350
 time to stay updated uses iphone two 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.279
 asus devices appeared in some 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 tests 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.590
 he surprised according to information from 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.960
 Geisy for the website and fry the in was 2 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 with 4 GB of RAM left behind 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.219
 competitors such as moto ge hit 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.940
 with top-of-the-line 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.510
 previous generation as galaxy s 5 htc one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.210
 mi-8 and galaxy note 4 handset gives aso 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.629
 was especially highlighted in tests of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.300
 200 cores we went 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.020
 to line alumia microsoft presented 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 the lumia 430 dual sim is the most 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.359
 cheaper than the company has launched this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.969
 lumia will cost $ 70 what gives a few 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.430
 220 reais in direct conversion without 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.549
 taxes it has windows phone 8.1 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.659
 4 inch screen with 800 resolution 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.659
 by 480 pixels snapdragon processor 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.450
 200 of cut of 1.2 ghz 1 gb of memory 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.299
 8 gb of internal expandable space 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.930
 with micro sd card and 2 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.049
 megapixels and 0.3 megapixels this model 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 will be sold in selected markets 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.000
 there is no information on a possible 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.259
 launch in Brazil microsoft we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 to samsung 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.210
 just take a look at some photos that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.640
 show how the galaxy s 6 is inside the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.920
 most fixeads website folks followed the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 instructions in the 6 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.450
 completely disassemble the appliance 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.520
 remove the battery but they found 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.189
 that this is not an easy process in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 take a lot to get the 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.560
 battery they heated the back cover 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 for three minutes they removed it's after 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.399
 have to remove a plastic film 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 and an nfc transmitter 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.069
 you need to unscrew the motherboard to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.440
 take it off, then you can turn it off and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.290
 take the battery 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.060
 instructions in manual 26 but this does not 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.000
 It's work for anyone. 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.460
 For who knows what he's doing, look at it. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.350
 How cool is a Brazilian woman? 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.930
 part of the team that developed a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 more efficient the material graphene 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 graphene is a form of carbon having a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.410
 honeycomb structure 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.480
 it is thin and very resistant only 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
 loses properties at temperature 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.130
 environment the teacher and christian smith 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.830
 her colleagues at utrecht university 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.230
 Netherlands have published a study on the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.660
 material based on nano crystals of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.270
 mercury and tellurium that have the same 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.940
 of graphene 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.610
 maintain their semiconductor properties 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.770
 same room temperature then this 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.200
 new material is a candidate for 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.350
 replace silicon in the production of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.520
 it still can not be 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.910
 experienced but the Brazilian believes 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.680
 that if it is synthesized in a new 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.590
 field of research and innovation 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.960
 technology would open up would be possible 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 for example thinking of replacing 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.090
 current through a current of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.090
 thorns that would speed up computers and 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.870
 internet and what else is possible 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.180
 to imagine 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.030
 following with today's video if you already 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 received any notification related to 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.739
 one such that the magnet has no idea what 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.510
 be that we explain that the real 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.270
 name of a question and answer application 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.350
 answers in the style of ask.com fm do 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.209
 formspring 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.440
 The difference is that it works in 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.989
 smartphones 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.670
 application adherence has been large 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.519
 questions can be asked 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.769
 anonymously but the answers are never 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.019
 anonymous if you are interested can 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.300
 tecmundo access this news that there 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.280
 has the links for you to download what to 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.310
 android or the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.010
 and just look at a Chinese manufacturer of 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.500
 phones plan to build factories 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.320
 here in Brazil to prevent rates from 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.750
 import we are talking about tcl one 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.239
 the largest mobile phone manufacturers in 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.380
 four members of television sets and 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.940
 even refrigerators 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.239
 the company is eyeing markets 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.150
 and build factories in these 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.500
 would be a way of avoiding 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.160
 import tariffs 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.050
 information is oiter brazil agency 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.900
 now take a look at a video that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.180
 It shows how a shot gun more 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.010
 popularly known as 12 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.440
 this video first shows the whole 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.780
 disassembly process 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.760
 then a cut was made on it to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.770
 show how the system works. 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.420
 loading is telling the truth is not 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.330
 many people like to reproduce this 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.970
 move as soon as a shot is fired 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.310
 the slider is unlocked and starts to go 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.280
 back until the time when the ammunition 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.100
 worn out of the barrel and then to the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.610
 sliding forward a new 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.770
 project loads and we close the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.470
 Today's video with a recommendation from 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.620
 reading this bacanuda is the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.940
 our analysis of motorola moto and 4g of 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.430
 tv colors 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.800
 beyond reading yet on the apparatus 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.650
 and also a really cool video for you 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.080
 know the second generation of the bike and a 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.120
 the motorola input device will not 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.419
 there access to this material of the world 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.910
 it's worth it and thats it this was more 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.710
