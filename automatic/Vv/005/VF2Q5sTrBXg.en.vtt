00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.120
 in quotes here in chile I have

 and I've played with the best you can 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.750
 tell of the world in this discipline the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.820
 billiards how did you get to the public for me 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.250
 dad my dad was a lifetime player 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.159
 pool I remember that the child was going to 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.619
 watch how he played 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.960
 and I liked the vial because in the past 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.909
 I played soccer but I liked more the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.429
 pool and I started playing as a child as 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.750
 I told you about 12 years and 17 and 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.969
 I started going out of the country that was 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.959
 my first country was from Peru and from there 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.959
 forward no longer standing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.840
 good bernardita I'm going to invite you to play 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 so you can learn this game 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.900
 This game consists of a taco taco of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 pool that this has a sole this is 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.420
 Flame sole outside was out of the country 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 he says in chapel or says in mouthpiece 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.890
 and there 's a chalk that the sole you have to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
 comes out always used to hit or else 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.030
 If you do not give them this, they will not step on you 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.310
 you can hit already then with this cue 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.310
 you play pool for example the basics 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.650
 the most basic are 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.900
 of holy art santa the ball for example 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.979
 so you hit a ball and the ball 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.979
 Blanca stays seated 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.310
 even sitting 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.380
 and another basic 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.950
 that you hit the ball again and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.550
 the white runs with the order that is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.550
 running flame 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.000
 that is run that follows the ball to 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.450
 there 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.820
 and another is to chop the leaf the blas that is 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.650
 can you say that you hit the ball 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.989
 white returns for you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.989
 that is called chopped or pulled 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.830
 hopefully 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.950
 already then only 3 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.600
 because he has to send but what 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 is fundamental in the technique here in the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.610
 arm in the arm when you hit yourself 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.290
 you have to have a swing here not 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.530
 you can move the heel and so neither 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.720
 move or always be close to the body 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.910
 always so is the technique of hitting 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.390
 this looks at this is based so that for 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.980
 when it will act for example a ball here 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.580
 there is not enough with the body when arriving 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.420
 there you do not reach you use like a bridge 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.800
 so here in Chile it is called 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.800
 Devil is called Donkey 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.349
 claudio how long ago he opened the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.579
 club olive here in good conception 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:54.549

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:57.700
 2012 of a family business that is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.260
 composed of my dad and me and an uncle 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.480

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.459
 to the influx of public has been 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.829
 pretty good the reception to the lounge has 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.349
 been good enough there was a clientele 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.959
 already relatively made my dad carries 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.579
 years in the topic also of the pool here 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.680
 in conception in the different rooms 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.320
 playing with the different players like this 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.419
 and there was a flow of public that we 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.139
 we expected which has been very very real 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.139

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.340
