00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.710
 successful lights highlight and welcome 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.359
 for this tutorial my first tutorial 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 by the way on my channel finally everything 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.310
 short actually this moment like the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.679
 tutorial i have to say i'm a little bit 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.109
 nervous 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.170
 finally short so here we are 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.800
 so for a pretty enough tutorial 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.800
 nice 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.100
 so we'll start right now 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.650
 so you see here during the game 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.770
 you will find corpses of 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.430
 skeletons with cards like that that 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 you will have to take on the corpse 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.440
 hi nathan to the seals so is you 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.720
 see it's small treasures marked 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.719
 by crosses and as a rule these 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.170
 treasures there it's reserved for 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.060
 do not appear on the map 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.909
 so wait i'm showing you by 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.439
 example there there is a low chest he will not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 appear like that it's up to you 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.119
 find at the specific place where there is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.840
 the cross what you also need to know 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.539
 is that most of the time drawing 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.270
 edat so lille has changed a little but 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:36.750
 in its overall global aggregate libya 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.470
 well we will say in the sense your general 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.180
 it's more or less right here I am 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.190
 will get there 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 so here's where I opened the road 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.760
 weapons to you have the map 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.680
 so here I am going to show you everything from 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.440
 following how can you 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.470
 to find a treasure the most 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.660
 easily from the world so it's very 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.100
 simple it you open your card and 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:08.550
 treasure fight so I took like 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.330
 example this treasure so normally 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.930
 that's it down right you have a 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 figure at the beginning I had not understood I 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.830
 saw this figure I thought it was 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.220
 the amount of what was in the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.959
 chest 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.640
 but after I saw that the numbers to 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.500
 every time he was very random and 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.360
 I told myself it's still a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.100
 chest to 749 1625 real is a lot 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 still 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:40.769
 so I started to cogitate so after 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.049
 I noticed something else when you 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.170
 open the map 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.580
 you have a number that appears to 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.370
 every time you move on 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.130
 the hand you see and these numbers in 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 did exactly what 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:02.610
 had marked on the map 749 625 so 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.310
 you know your your treasure is 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.130
 on this island island you see it you 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.340
 you or but well as it should 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.750
 there you see that there are little tricks 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 that appear there is nothing else on 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.510
 id because I say at all costs except 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.500
 that reason in question so I'm going 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.340
 show you right away 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.989
 so we look at the map we see the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.980
 shape of Lille so we know it's at 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:33.750
 north of the island so what we do is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.110
 that we put a small dot on the north of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.070
 the island more or less here like that we know 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.170
 already that's where we take the bar and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.760
 as by chance I'm right next to 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.549
 lille it's very very weird all this 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.700
 but it's done on purpose you imagine if 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.769
 during the tutorial I had to travel 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:04.870
 up to the island so I was on the other 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:07.959
 side of 2.9 to say of the matte and so 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.209
 it would have taken or pam or 20 minutes 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.879
 before heading to foot + 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.180
 every time I have problems with 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.310
 boats boats and enemies 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.919
 because I 'm a pleasure to myself 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.490
 related costs making it do the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.460
 misery finally good is the crisis among the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.440
 Spanish I can tell you this a 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.960
 apparently there are people who want 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.470
 join my crew so I'm going 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.039
 go save them 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:54.690
 so go save it here it is 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:54.690
 did it make the bar very high 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.979
 tin speak like that and join my 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:09.960
 crew 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:12.419
 oh damn it 's two people in 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.610
 the crew over you see I have 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.639
 still lost a lot of people 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.610
 my crew what actually happened 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.949
 because I wanted to make the con 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:29.039
 did I attacked a boat from the 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.520
 English navy was comfortable with 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.590
 minus 100 guns on each side and I 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.840
 kill them and I managed to the mas recreation 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.150
 but after I got killed when 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.740
 I took the boat a penny finally good 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.120
 short we are not here for that so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.820
 increases not seeing the map 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.669
 what does it tell us about us? 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.710
 indicates that towards this big rock there is the 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:54.270
 treasure so now you no longer have 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.949
 than to try to find it by looking 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.349
 on the ground normally there will be a small 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:03.060
 round that should be here dig up and 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.900
 there you will only have to pay 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.720
 will be and to pick up the jackpot 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.889
 that's all for this tutorial I hope 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.560
 that it happens to you and nothing of these 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.479
 treasure chests amenc de fric 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.800
 all other treasure chests and 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.680
 sometimes you even like a plan 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.389
 to improve your boat or change 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.220
 its aesthetics the c1 a figurehead 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.080
 sure we ate a phoenix there for 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.650
 the moment I come that does on the 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.289
 phoenix and I changed the veils etc etc 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.060
 I added the cases we finally brief my 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.280
 boat are feeling more and more 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.800
 a warship 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.720
 so here on this I leave you 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.150
