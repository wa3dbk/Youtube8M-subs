00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:07.870
 hello very good everyone I'm 97 javier 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.719
 Sanchez and well here I bring you a trick 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 of skyteam which is to find a 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.650
 down below 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 and good as you can see I'm in the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.360
 white career entry in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 that we go to the 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.610
 left and you will see these stairs 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 we went up the stairs and saw this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 casa carlota valentina casa de carlota 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
 valentina because in this house is where 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.220
 let's do everything we go here 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.380
 let's get to know this wooden bridge 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.380
 and let's go for this wall 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.739
 until the end 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.610
 well, we are in the back 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.800
 the roof and jumped for it 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.300
 and now in the endorsement by giving him the button 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.870
 of jumping all the time so we can 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.810
 get up on everything 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.810
 and Japan and today 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.420
 we are already up now we continue this 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.880
 road 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 until you get to these two dragons that 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.310
 they are next to the door of the wall 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.479
 we were in a where jump is 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.549
 very good 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.090
 and we were just above and little 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.090
 complicated but that's why what you have to 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 do now we jump to the wall come 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.760
 just where I am as you can see 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.030
 we are in the air I saw it covered 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.100
 well the following is how you can see in 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.050
 this little wall we have here 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.920
 next to stretch inside 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.080
 be careful because 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.970
 because if you do not have anything good like I do not 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.299
 is in killing so I do not know how 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.299
 they can do 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.730
 come when appearing slower you should not 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.020
 the good thing we continue here as 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.600
 can see is the career door 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.120
 white we are below the ground and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.250
 Well, what we do is go for the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.890
 side of the wall bordering all the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 white race until you get where you are going 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.420
 to see now 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.220
 they follow completely my steps and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.420
 will come to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.420
 someone to arrive we go 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.720
 there is not a channel like this but we are going to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.720
 know each other badly and that's it 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.000
 As you can see, we are bordering 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.310
 the entire career wall marks by 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.790
 outside and inside that you can not 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 cross him 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:52.760
 under the ground we go if you want 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.760
 try it but of themselves as how 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.709
 you see, let's go to the end 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.230
 of the wall and we put ourselves next to 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.390
 dragon's account as you can see there 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.860
 is dragon tip and we carry up 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.230
 an area where the stones are finished 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.640
 they see there is only one at the bottom but we are 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.099
 in the dragon basin and it's over 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.580
 all the stones are worth there are the 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.580
 little houses and here are the last stones 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.400
 we are waiting for a hole in the ground 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.700
 huge which can be on top not 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.710
 fall and well then in this hole see 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.680
 one the last stone of all those that 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.459
 there is good this is the last stone that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.430
 you have to go up there and there is a 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.870
 stone stuck to the wall well then 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.850
 this stone can be crossed and that's what 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.130
 what we have to do now left and 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.740
 we cross the stone and they take to be 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.330
 be under the forge of the oscillate to 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.340
 grace 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.130
 we are right below and as you can see 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.700
 here is the chest is a magic chest 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.650
 below left over 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.430
 and it gets right below and look with 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.599
 fry and are pretty good things 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.989
 the best thing is that what I have then 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.700
 I work nothing but arrows and good 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.690
 best of all I think this trunk is 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.130
 the gold there because there is always or 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.989
 there are also ebony ingots that are 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.840
 much needed in this game for 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.190
 be done in good mature and gold 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.519
 thousand and one hundred and always there is 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.949
 practically 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.849
 so well, well, I do not know when 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:24.169
 recover I do not know is as a type 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.289
 practically one tried to wait 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.960
 hours to catch fuck with sugar 8 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.159
 good and finally to leave the bus 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.620
 under this what you have to do then 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.620
 you can simply give the map 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.440
 a damn slower automatic saves 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.500
 good and here I show you 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.500
 I'm not going to take this away 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.840
 and well, he travels in the white race 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.900
 for example anywhere they travel to 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.460
 any site and they will appear then normal 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.740
 no more as if it had never happened 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.630
 anything just to have the thousand-odd 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.570
 I love what I have chosen 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.120
 what I 'm telling you is that this does not have 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.260
 no problem is reflex work of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.350
 He 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.360
 in the play or nothing 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.450
 It is not a tube that the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.100
 creators of the game bet so 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.320
 Well, all you have to do is 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.920

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.960
 discovered anything and copy it 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.800
