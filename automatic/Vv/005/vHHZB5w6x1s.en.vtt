different now since I have my new

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
different now since I have my new
stadium<00:00:12.480> which<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> mfp<00:00:13.679> attack-type

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
stadium which is the mfp attack-type

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.720 
stadium which is the mfp attack-type
Stadium<00:00:15.049> my<00:00:16.049> videos<00:00:16.410> now<00:00:16.619> are<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> lot<00:00:17.520> better

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Stadium my videos now are a lot better

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.859 
Stadium my videos now are a lot better
than<00:00:17.850> they<00:00:18.119> used<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.480> be<00:00:18.660> as<00:00:19.020> well<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
than they used to be as well as the

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
than they used to be as well as the
results<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> Bey<00:00:22.140> battles<00:00:22.500> being<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.580> more

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
results of Bey battles being a lot more

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.509 
results of Bey battles being a lot more
accurate<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.070> said<00:00:26.279> I'm<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.430> to

the different types of launch techniques

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.930 
the different types of launch techniques
that<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.329> used<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> battle<00:00:34.399> now<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.820> most

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that can be used in a battle now to most

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.410 
that can be used in a battle now to most
of<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.980> people<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.370> remember<00:00:38.820> beyblades

of you people that remember beyblades

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.560 
of you people that remember beyblades
from<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> old<00:00:39.870> plastic<00:00:40.230> generation<00:00:41.570> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
from the old plastic generation you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970 
from the old plastic generation you
should<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.930> know<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.290> technique<00:00:43.680> these

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
should all know this technique these

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
should all know this technique these
techniques<00:00:44.460> by<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
techniques by now but I'm for the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.889 
techniques by now but I'm for the
younger<00:00:46.020> guys<00:00:46.170> who<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.899> found

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
younger guys who would have just found

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
younger guys who would have just found
metal<00:00:49.260> fusion<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.550> first<00:00:50.730> came<00:00:50.940> out

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
metal fusion when it first came out

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.229 
metal fusion when it first came out
whether<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:52.160> from<00:00:53.160> last<00:00:53.370> year<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:53.969> until

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
whether it be from last year or up until

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
whether it be from last year or up until
now<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.379> may<00:00:55.530> not<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.710> some<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
now you may not know some of these and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
now you may not know some of these and
you<00:00:56.460> launch<00:00:56.699> techniques<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.750> um<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
you launch techniques that um can

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
you launch techniques that um can
actually<00:00:58.590> help<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.920> B<00:00:59.039> bleed<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually help your B bleed when you a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.639 
actually help your B bleed when you a
few<00:01:00.329> more<00:01:00.449> battles<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.230> three<00:01:01.440> launch

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
few more battles there are three launch

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.280 
few more battles there are three launch
techniques<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.370> guys<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.390> your

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
techniques so you guys get it right your

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560 
techniques so you guys get it right your
normal<00:01:04.559> launch<00:01:04.739> technique<00:01:05.420> right<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
normal launch technique right in the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.380 
normal launch technique right in the
center<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> stadium<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.830> bank<00:01:11.070> shot

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
center of the stadium the bank shot

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.640 
center of the stadium the bank shot
where<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.900> towards<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> outside

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
where you have it towards the outside

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.499 
where you have it towards the outside
and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.130> angle<00:01:14.520> towards<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> slope

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
and you angle towards with the slope

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.760 
and you angle towards with the slope
angle<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.200> down<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> loop<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.650> now

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
angle it down with this loop and now

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.510 
angle it down with this loop and now
finally<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.310> last<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.360> slide<00:01:21.630> shot

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
finally your last one the slide shot

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
finally your last one the slide shot
keep<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> towards<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> outside<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
keep it towards the outside and you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.730 
keep it towards the outside and you
bring<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:27.509> left<00:01:27.900> arm<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.320> launching<00:01:28.619> arm

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
bring the left arm or launching arm

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.469 
bring the left arm or launching arm
forward

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
forward

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.490 
forward
so<00:01:30.479> those<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> three<00:01:31.049> different<00:01:31.380> launch

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
so those are the three different launch

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.550 
so those are the three different launch
techniques<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.310> used<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.700> beyblades

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
techniques that we used in beyblades

00:01:34.560 --> 00:03:03.980 
techniques that we used in beyblades
you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.020 

I<00:03:04.020> hope<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.070> guys<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.400> enjoyed<00:03:05.430> this<00:03:05.760> video

I hope you guys have enjoyed this video

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:17.430 
I hope you guys have enjoyed this video
and<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.570> put<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.050> good<00:03:07.080> use
