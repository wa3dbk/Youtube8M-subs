00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 saying it was because he died a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.150
 kid who declared himself his fan in the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.960
 passed in the past eurocopa to a boy 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.389
 Polish 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.800
 to see that he had found out on Tuesday 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.480
 of the death of the Polish boy and for 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.130
 that did not celebrate the goals came a lot 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.140
 yesterday's message when we talk about 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.520
 here of why the non-celebration or the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.400
 polishing the information on that subject 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.840
 to see if there is anything out there or not 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.480
 let's see the simple reason that 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.660
 squares learn of the death of 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.460
 this guy yesterday Wednesday since when 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.230
 the match was being played 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.450
 boxes did not know the death of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.340
 this boy then impossible that that 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.570
 be the reason why boxes do not 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.390
 they celebrated goals 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.730
 it is true that squares was very close 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 this guy was with him in several 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.120
 occasions during the Euro Cup of 10 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.649
 squares learns on Wednesday one day 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.289
 after the party of the death of 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.480
 this guy then that's not the reason why 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.070
 which squares do not celebrate goals and 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.070
 one more piece of that night of squares 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.750
 on Facebook the training is finished and 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 he is very ill but he wanted the illusion 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.409
 to meet iker casillas that solves 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.369
 with the fact it was seen after a 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.620
 training of the Spanish national team 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.020
 itself in Poland 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.130
 box fence was with him during I 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.800
 I think it was ten or fifteen minutes 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.900
 he was yesterday with him he behaved 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.760
 extraordinarily then he stayed in 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.710
 contact with the family and that has 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.850
 ported extraordinary with choosing touched and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
 that he exceeded him less in that is a 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360
 simple reason I am simple reason and 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.060
 Javier I answered answered when it happens 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.350
 something like that and you raise something the first thing that 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.030
 does is any athlete is to point 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.440
 with your fingers towards oxygen if you already 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 we get it we also discussed the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.290
 feelings the truth that yes you 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.850
 remember those people because in addition 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.740
 with nothing else if you are very supportive and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.330
 always if the process of heaven what 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.760
 usually they will usually die 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.220
 to people 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.720
 it is clear that there are many people 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 down you do not know what you're going for 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.650
 does not celebrate the goals I have not polished what 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 he says he's between today he wants Wednesday 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.580
 this the match was on Tuesday with what 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.250
 which was not the reason for problems 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.200
 of that night and is that iker boxes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.920
 I had committed at least one 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.600
 radio interview that night and asked 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.060
 cancel it 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.710
 at least one and asked not to enter the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.050
 night on the night of the party 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.230
 match 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.940
 he was not there was not his life was not 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 I was not at all 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.950
 and to me the reasons they give me are 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.050
 sports and not necessarily 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.960
 controversial controversial sports bar 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.900
 but sports exclusively that and that 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.470
 he is so annoyed with himself 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.820
 because he had conceded the goals and because 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.950
 there was not a good performance and 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.720
 they were left with coins or are very jealous of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.410
 his fitness 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.410
 then and
