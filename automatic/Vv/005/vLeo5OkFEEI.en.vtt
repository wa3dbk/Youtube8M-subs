00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.430
 hey people here and we come to one 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.960
 next episode of mine talk let us 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.639
 Let me tell you why 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 that got it all but there was 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.440
 he was recently scandal to o2 that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 crafting pad a couple of double 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.010
 uploaded held twice because he 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.460
 wanted to have no punishment and that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 came out because pixel wolf the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 opinion was that it is public 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.510
 and you have to do it publicly 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.910
 must talk about it and public 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 must accuse and yes that's just 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 come out blablabla I want that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.050
 Do not actually talk because of that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.910
 situation is actually already clarified 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 Much more bothers me this punishment 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 has brought to power if it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.190
 it is the result of two to unload it 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.170
 someone if he does not upload a following 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 his entire inventory quality that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 means his fitness is gone to the inventory 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 because of his whole heart he was quasi 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 again following one another and that means if 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.960
 you 're in part 20 then and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 are thrown back on parties again 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.860
 then is over'd basically you have no 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 chance to win this project and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.710
 this rule was not clear before he got it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
 indeed, I have the following 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.129
 Looks like it was ok if you have one now 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.539
 somehow follow if I get lost 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.710
 why does not that have to be me 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.449
 you have lost yourself 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 the project is over for you, so to speak 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.150
 I did not know and that's actually it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 for me a total shit 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.770
 whoever came up with that is 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 a total shit we fall on the 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.970
 fast instant instant four ideas 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.920
 or nearly five billion ideas 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.299
 best one can say about that okay 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 successes not uploaded to punishment 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.140
 that had to be a consequence now 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 so the others are allowed to continue together 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 enchant you just have to suspend 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.990
 15 minutes less without may 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 do not break down a part so continue 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.829
 just hide and walk around or 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 You are allowed to use a patent literally 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.520
 as otherwise it holds other handicap 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 moments that's of candy fitness is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 this is both arms on the back 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.460
 tied and legs and sawed off 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.869
 I say as well as punishments now there is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.159
 and I wonder if there is one more 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.899
 further punishment gives this in the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.909
 direction was for u 3 i find that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.110
 totally cool to be honest and I now 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.509
 also probably want to look so 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.369
 is not that exciting everywhere I think 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.899
 not all youtuber but at 1 2 now 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.040
 if i definitely watch it though 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.960
 you already the third edition of 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.340
 was and I have the hope that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.140
 hopefully the project will continue 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.969
 developed from the rules of the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.960
 structure and otherwise the game world was 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.579
 Do you really want to grow up there ? 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.079
 I can do my husband could still 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.819
 build in that level my healthy sky 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.340
 world has that above you still has something 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.410
 where then something is but where it is 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 actually cool how about me is so 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500
 Grünberger murdered version there is one 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.700
 that's why you guys benefit for a good reason 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.590
 too over powered if you are then always 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.040
 could export to the team camp on 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.720
 every case 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 I hope that I have this project 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 evolved and that was u3 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.390
 Decent will be in the video two video 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.370
 Kitas probably also briefly mentioned that before 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.510
 ware started in wiso one and a half hours 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 rules were explained 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.860
 So there are probably quite a lot of rules 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 yes generally says there are two types of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.030
 brainstorm a brainstorm thing too 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.500
 just a short and a little bit too much 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.090
 went long and I would say that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.550
 it was or was possible to brainstorm 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 definitely definitely went to long or 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.280
 Too many thoughts were making 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 easy to copy and the rule with 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.550
 the inventory clearly such a shit 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.530
 seriously you can maybe 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.319
 make it the first ten follow it applies 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.030
 but even after that lay with the rule 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.500
 Otherwise, I 'm sorry for everyone 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.420
 it somehow gets lost because of it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.800
 any mistake or anything else 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.390
 all hire when still is in team 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.709
 high-tech teammate also does what he does 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.319
 but in the end I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.430
 pharo and will, too, I look white 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.810
 namely, that's a pity that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.610
 Talents I do not believe that 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 join in because you take more serious now 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.640
 the musicians are otherwise quite a few 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.440
 skármeta charger otherwise writes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.239
 you ask in the comments as her 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.680
 find with the rules which regulation 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.720
 you would like to have some in why 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.370
 Modifications here would like for the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.269
 that it a bit 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.980
 is extended and for whom ever since 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.610
 Anyway , please look at me in the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.049
 Comments 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.879
 I would be very happy and otherwise 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.080
 his next people again were that 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.510
 one easy one would be very happy 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.099
 if you are interested in this topic 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.190
 and otherwise I say until the next 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.190
 times
