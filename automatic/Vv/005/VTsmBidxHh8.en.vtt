00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.439
 for a certain time what I have to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.900
 explain now as concentration 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.000
 because I'm going to talk about what 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.700
 supposedly it is one of the issues that does not 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.800
 they should touch each other that they are inside 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.430
 good social relations and has 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.850
 what to do with god politics religion 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.850
 exactly madeline 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.390
 exactly good look what 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 steve jobs this tremendous scientist 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.650
 certain specialist in the theory of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.540
 holes of black hole worms and 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.910
 about possible temporary ones and that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.220
 He wrote many decades ago and that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 famous time it was in 'big bang' in 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.590
 the true theory of the creation of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.379
 universe notice that I just throw a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.309
 quite controversial and it is to the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.020
 spokesmen the publication of the book 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.550
 approval obligation that is about 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.710
 to come out that is that god figure 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.870
 mythical is that of a great creator of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 all the things that we know exist 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 animal in animals and reflect as 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.110
 we would have no place in the new 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.090
 hypothesis of creation the existence and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 consistency of the cosmos 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 before leaving I have in depth me 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.070
 I would like to show you why this wants 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 being a scientist has just joined the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 theory of new geneticists and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 biologists who are currently taking 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.290
 a lot of documentary for the rescue of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 the humanity that is increasingly 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.810
 scarce on our planet 30 seconds and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.189
 we go back with stephen hawking that up 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.909
 precisely what we show in a cinema 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.909
 previous therapy 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.009
 subtitles to low angels 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 down 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.190
 plants 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.640
 from behind I did not access the insertion of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.640
 health 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.950
 the magnificent book and talks about the same 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.680
 that with the mere presence of gravity 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.710
 that in gravity in his most account is 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.810
 the curvature it causes in space 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.270
 the existence of the solid body and that 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.310
 double say this way would generate 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.530
 a series of phenomena that chained 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.120
 they generate different types of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.310
 situations that are running things 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.550
 like us that only beings with life 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.770
 smart wow is very serious what it says 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.100
 because here when a scientist tells you 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.160
 of this thickness notice that in the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.780
 religion a little more academic it 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.570
 feel a little in trouble because 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 only the game be on the side of the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.750
 faith 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.990
 but it was not that 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.880
 the big-bang does not contradict the existence 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.490
 of a god that said now says that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.470
 clearly god as I imagined 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.690
 explains that God says that in the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.340
 imagine in the structure of the new by 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.970
 so we do not understand it 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.890
 good since there religions 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.710
 terminology there are actually two 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.050
 types of god the only god to the father the 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.950
 holy trinity there is one who is 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.870
 omniscient and omnipotent and omnipresent 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.150
 that we are all a part of God 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.770
 and therefore it is God in use 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.280
 different forms is one of us 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.600
 and it is in god demiurge that is the one 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.710
 comes looks creates a believes something and leaves 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.360
 like a watchmaker that is a watch 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.500
 working and then it has its own 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.710
 existence 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.380
 according to estimate the fortress only a god with 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.460
 this second feature 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.320
 I would have the possibility of someone who created 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.300
 towards where the thing pointed someone 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.670
 threw the first stone I think after 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.320
 he did not get in anymore I'm going to read four 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.240
 maximums that are in the book with ready 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.700
 iron because this you think about it 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.130
 fits modern science does not let 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.170
 space the concept of god to super 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.390
 and hyper powerful the big bang was 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.980
 consequence of physical laws do not 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.440
 he was probably educated he understood 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.150
 creator since it exists is like the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.550
 gravity the universe explains itself 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.960
 only the last two creation 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.270
 spontaneous is the reason that there is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.740
 something that there is a universe that 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.350
 we are since they are 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.910
 almost rational consequence as I said 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.980
 the first video that we have brought but not 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.590
 is that there is an organization plan and 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:54.350
 that someone wanted if instead 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.550
 and its form says that there is the 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.890
 possibility that there are others 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.870
 planets and another universe by the 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.210
 purpose that God creates man is 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.940
 possible universe would be 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.190
 that is, I write so many courses and 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.990
 not only put them in something that is 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.729
 interesting how interesting this gives 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.220
 a tremendous controversy premieres and louise 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.979
 brown where science and technology 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.800
 they are in a very pragmatic area 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.020
 in front of still a resistance 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.060
 philosophical and also existential that 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.039
 based on religion then every 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.199
 time more answers to the big 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.479
 questions of man and that competes between 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.919
 science technology versus region what 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.000
 This program is being proposed to us 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.020
 particular today is that stephen hawking 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.849
 complements the respected front in the 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.240
 national community not only with 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.949
 scientists but also in religion 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:47.840
 is fundamentally based mostly on 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:49.400
 Catholicism but as the chicken says 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.410
 when you through science and 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.300
 technology you are responding to 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.440
 questions that you do not want to find the 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.930
 answer because the answer 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.150
 but it's funny because you notice that only 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.680
 to close the last scientist who 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.540
 we give a conference 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.270
 also a big difference in physics 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.280
 quantum is said the problem does not exist 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.560
 or there is no god only that maybe I 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.750
 should be rethought to bring all the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.110
 discoveries with an intelligence 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:22.390
 underlying that creates designs and thrives in 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:24.670
 its purpose and it is a concept that 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.560
 many say that in funds and seven god 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.800
 it is everywhere and they are each 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.529
 when this is a topic 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.420
 quiet 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.040
 and for me personally 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.990
 beyond that I'm Catholic and everything and 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.990
 there are a lot of things in ones 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.500
 and that puts the theme of the god where 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.750
 we come that protects us the human being 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.380
 you need to believe in someone superior both 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:53.740
 to say lean on him as well 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.790
 tell him to tell us to blame him for 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.790
 something to someone 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.580
 imanol to see tomorrow all the newspapers 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.020
 is sitting the discussion is going to be a 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.370
 theme for a while in the community 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.190
 scientific I insist and the big ones 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.190
 utilities of the world
