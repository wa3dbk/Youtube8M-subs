she really ovulated way before we put a
anthrax<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.660> best<00:00:24.840> part<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.289> she's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
anthrax in but the best part is she's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
anthrax in but the best part is she's
albino<00:00:25.859> sunfire<00:00:26.400> lavender<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.810> we're<00:00:28.080> hoping

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
albino sunfire lavender so we're hoping

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
albino sunfire lavender so we're hoping
to<00:00:28.410> make<00:00:28.560> everything<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.310> clutch<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
to make everything out of this clutch so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
to make everything out of this clutch so
if<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.990> tiger<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> make<00:00:31.859> literally

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
if it's a tiger we can make literally

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
if it's a tiger we can make literally
everything<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.570> pretty<00:00:33.719> sure<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
everything which we're pretty sure it is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
everything which we're pretty sure it is
we'll<00:00:34.410> find<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> babies<00:00:35.160> hatch<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
we'll find out in the babies hatch the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.639 
we'll find out in the babies hatch the
only<00:00:35.880> thing<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.149> saw<00:00:36.360> locked<00:00:36.570> up<00:00:36.750> yeah<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
only thing I saw locked up yeah that is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
only thing I saw locked up yeah that is
amazing<00:00:37.829> no<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.640> doesn't<00:00:38.940> mean<00:00:39.030> anything<00:00:39.059> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
amazing no it doesn't mean anything but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880 
amazing no it doesn't mean anything but
the<00:00:39.629> other<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.079> only<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.800> beginning

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the other one was only in the beginning

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
the other one was only in the beginning
so<00:00:41.370> usually<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.000> better<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.420> our<00:00:42.510> their

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
so usually we do better with our their

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
so usually we do better with our their
