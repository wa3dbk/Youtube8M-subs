00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
 yes yes that's a lot because 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.010
 the 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.040
 how were the minor categories of 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:13.330
 I always played the court below 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:18.100
 and he came down to see me and well 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.700
 they gave away shoes to play and good he 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.289
 it helped me a lot in my growth always 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.570
 I was aware of what I was doing 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.000
 minor categories 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.200
 and when I was going up, I'm very supportive 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.480
 there in the first team and many 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.860
 many players who ended up then 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.890
 I always had an apprenticeship of each one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.690
 He always guides me and good 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.900
 reassure them the game in league but he 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.060
 he got along very well with lara and always 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.090
 when we played the congratulated 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.260
 He always told me that not for what 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.449
 To get far 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.050
 and I was always on the lookout if 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 He always sent advice, this was a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
 help for me I do not think that they already with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.899
 more trajectory with many more things what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 that was very good for me because I 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:16.460
 it helped to not have this any failure 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.600
 at that time and when I had them was 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.440
 they were also there to file 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.890
 [Music] 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.590
 just that much I do not think the support of 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.929
 the dads 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.020
 this one of my grandmother of my aunt I think that of 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.500
 all my brothers I think it's a support 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.780
 very 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.630
 it's very different because they are 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.440
 lovers are in the house they are 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.080
 supporting from there also telling you 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.310
 and that serves another than the support of my 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.110
 dad gave me a lot is all fire here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.180
 and he always told me to define 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.770
 decide 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.700
 this side that does not hurt so good 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.470
 are are details that at the right time 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.470
 and good to this day 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.400
 the country regrets and is dismayed to live 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.500
 here in the whole world mourns death 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 of christian benitez and is that it was a 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.370
 great soccer player but only 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 marked differences within a court 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.630
 he also did it outside of it was not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.630
 it was fantastic in terms of the internal one 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.110
 soccer team with his humility with his 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.819
 joy with your leadership always always 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.390
 united the groups, not because of that 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.760
 only stood out with this being 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.500
 individual as scoring champion 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.690
 motivator or goalscorer also in the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.470
 Collective why was champion where he played 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.569

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.730

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.750
