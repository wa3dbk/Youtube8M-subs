00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.420
 [music] 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.700
 These are the ruddy golden crust not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.729
 sweet pancakes are good in and of themselves 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.649
 however, the finished them are still exclusively 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.909
 for stuffing with some stuffing well 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.280
 Well let's get started 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.619
 cooking our long rolls 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.259
 laying on the surface a small length 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.030
 amount of cream cheese evenly 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 we will distribute it over the whole area 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.069
 the thickness of the cheese layer should not however 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:05.340
 exceed one two millimeters well here 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:07.640
 fine on top of the cheese lay out thinly 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.619
 sliced salted salmon 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.790
 We try to do it so that plastic 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.860
 the fish did not lean on each other 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.269
 [music] 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.610
 we lay them out as tightly as possible to each 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.390
 friend and evenly distributed throughout 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.390
 pancake square 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.390
 over fish fillet laid out on a pancake 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.579
 again we put philadelphia cheese also 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.579
 thin and evenly like the first time 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.299
 fine all that's left to do is 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:48.450
 roll up cooked 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:54.959
 billet in a tight even roll here 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.879
 so let's leave our convoy for a while to lie down 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.230
 and we will be engaged in production 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:07.829
 the other two are applied to the surface 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:11.970
 length cream cheese over cheese 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:16.200
 Spread rovnenko fish cause 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.890
 second layer of cheese and tightly turn our 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:30.979
 pancake roll 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:30.979
 [music] 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.590
 doing the same thing with our 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:46.049
 the third pancakes so we 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.049
 It turned out such here are three pretty girls 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.060
 all that's left to do is cut 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.879
 our rolls are the same width 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.829
 slices make it desirable sharp 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.270
 knife to rolls turned out 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:11.170
 beautiful and not lost shape 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:13.850
 [music] 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.250
 ready-to-serve pancake rolls 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.850
 spread on a large plate slightly 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.410
 correcting and giving them a rounded shape 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.570
 if you only want to file them later 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.000
 do not rush them for a while 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.490
 cut and put in the refrigerator as a whole 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.700
 cut state before serving 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.800
 on the table so they will retain their flavor and in 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.430
 refrigerated will be even easier 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.490
 cut 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.560
 our delightful and very original 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.760
 pancake rolls with slightly salty 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.280
 salmon ready 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.800
 serve them as a cold snack before 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.590
 the main feast though in my opinion 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.960
 they could take also decent 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.560
 place among your remaining holiday 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.650
