00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.600 
anyhow and a cooling system I just got
sort<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.530> cobbled<00:01:11.530> together<00:01:11.650> right<00:01:12.130> now<00:01:12.159> just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
sort of cobbled together right now just

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.420 
sort of cobbled together right now just
to<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.870> make<00:01:14.080> sure<00:01:14.290> everything's<00:01:14.800> ok<00:01:15.220> the

engines rebuilt but it never really had
an<00:01:17.920> extended<00:01:18.340> run<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:20.110> running<00:01:20.410> it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
an extended run I was running it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
an extended run I was running it
yesterday<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.600> seems<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.440> be<00:01:23.650> alright

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

yesterday and and it seems to be alright
yeah<00:01:25.600> that's<00:01:25.870> a<00:01:26.080> that's<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.680> regular<00:01:27.040> meat

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
yeah that's a that's a regular meat

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.850 
yeah that's a that's a regular meat
thermometer<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:29.200> just<00:01:29.410> jam<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:29.680> right

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
thermometer you just jam it right

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.350 
thermometer you just jam it right
through<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.280> webbing<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.790> radiator<00:01:31.180> and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
through the webbing of the radiator and

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.400 
through the webbing of the radiator and
that<00:01:31.660> gives<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:33.180> decent<00:01:34.180> reading<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.200> your

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
that gives you a decent reading of your

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.330 
that gives you a decent reading of your
temperature<00:01:37.530> had<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.890> coolant<00:01:39.310> system

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
temperature had the coolant system

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.370 
temperature had the coolant system
what's<00:01:39.880> really<00:01:40.300> bad<00:01:40.510> right<00:01:40.780> now<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.350> uh

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
what's really bad right now but uh

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.120 
what's really bad right now but uh
that's<00:01:42.280> going<00:01:42.490> to<00:01:42.550> get<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.730> lot<00:01:42.940> better<00:01:43.150> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that's going to get a lot better and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.090 
that's going to get a lot better and
here's<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.690> roller<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:47.260> I<00:01:47.320> was<00:01:47.560> machining

hoses on and I didn't expect them to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.360 
hoses on and I didn't expect them to
last<00:03:17.340> long<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.819> all<00:03:18.170> there's<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.349> all<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.099> all

I<00:03:36.680> want<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.739> get<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.980> up<00:03:38.069> on<00:03:38.250> axles

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
I want to get it up on axles

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.159 
I want to get it up on axles
well<00:03:40.919> one<00:03:41.129> axle<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.819> and<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.599> little<00:03:42.750> trailer

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
well one axle in a and a little trailer

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.449 
well one axle in a and a little trailer
hitch<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.590> could<00:03:43.739> pull<00:03:43.889> with<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.159> tractor

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
hitch so I could pull with my tractor

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.729 
hitch so I could pull with my tractor
move<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.879> around<00:03:45.109> and<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.260> got<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.620> another

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
move it around and I got to get another

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.000 
move it around and I got to get another
mount<00:03:47.639> back<00:03:47.970> here<00:03:48.269> somewhere<00:03:48.689> so<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.620> wanted<00:03:49.889> it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
mount back here somewhere so I wanted it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.729 
mount back here somewhere so I wanted it
to<00:03:50.129> have<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> little<00:03:50.549> bounce<00:03:51.139> but<00:03:52.139> not<00:03:52.349> all<00:03:52.560> that

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
to have a little bounce but not all that

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.470 
to have a little bounce but not all that
much<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.959> might<00:03:55.409> cut<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:55.980> tension<00:03:56.730> or<00:03:57.000> down<00:03:57.450> a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
much I might cut this tension or down a

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.720 
much I might cut this tension or down a
little<00:03:57.719> bit<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.799> can<00:03:58.919> get<00:03:59.040> some<00:03:59.189> more<00:03:59.310> travel

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
little bit so I can get some more travel

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.490 
little bit so I can get some more travel
on<00:03:59.849> there<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.239> mean<00:04:00.540> them<00:04:00.689> belts<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.230> have<00:04:01.349> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
on there I mean them belts don't have to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.890 
on there I mean them belts don't have to
be<00:04:01.590> much<00:04:01.769> tighter<00:04:02.069> than<00:04:02.219> that<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:02.659> I'd<00:04:03.659> like<00:04:03.840> a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
be much tighter than that but I'd like a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.629 
be much tighter than that but I'd like a
little<00:04:04.019> more<00:04:05.209> let<00:04:06.209> me<00:04:06.299> say<00:04:06.560> I'm<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.400> torn

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
little more let me say I'm kind of torn

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.869 
little more let me say I'm kind of torn
between<00:04:08.790> an<00:04:09.299> alternator<00:04:10.099> or<00:04:11.099> just<00:04:11.459> hooking<00:04:11.760> up

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
between an alternator or just hooking up

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.420 
between an alternator or just hooking up
a<00:04:11.970> small<00:04:12.239> 12-volt<00:04:12.810> power<00:04:13.049> supply<00:04:13.229> to<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:14.040> that

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
a small 12-volt power supply to it that

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.729 
a small 12-volt power supply to it that
would<00:04:14.690> keep<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.840> battery<00:04:16.139> charged<00:04:16.500> while

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
would keep the battery charged while

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.899 
would keep the battery charged while
it's<00:04:16.859> running<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> power<00:04:17.519> supply<00:04:17.849> is

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
it's running and the power supply is

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:19.750 
it's running and the power supply is
going<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.180> run<00:04:18.299> off<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.570> generator<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.229> course

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
going to run off the generator of course

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.899 
going to run off the generator of course
then<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.820> got<00:04:20.970> one<00:04:21.150> less<00:04:21.359> belt<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.780> worry<00:04:21.959> about

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.300 

eventually<00:04:27.080> this<00:04:28.080> circuit<00:04:28.590> breakers<00:04:28.979> got<00:04:29.159> to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
eventually this circuit breakers got to

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.270 
eventually this circuit breakers got to
get<00:04:29.430> relocated<00:04:29.820> I<00:04:30.500> think<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:34.130> build<00:04:35.130> an

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
get relocated I think and build an

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.520 
get relocated I think and build an
enclosure<00:04:35.699> for<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.150> whole<00:04:36.389> thing<00:04:37.820> but<00:04:38.820> uh<00:04:39.530> and

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
enclosure for the whole thing but uh and

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.350 
enclosure for the whole thing but uh and
I<00:04:40.620> haven't<00:04:40.919> even<00:04:41.039> checked<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.759> generator<00:04:42.240> to

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
I haven't even checked the generator to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.330 
I haven't even checked the generator to
see<00:04:42.509> if<00:04:42.599> it's<00:04:42.720> but<00:04:42.900> now<00:04:43.080> yet<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.740> know<00:04:43.889> it<00:04:44.130> did

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
see if it's but now yet I know it did

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.640 
see if it's but now yet I know it did
and<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.479> know<00:04:45.539> if<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:45.840> does<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.169> all<00:04:46.259> I<00:04:46.289> got<00:04:46.530> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
and I know if it does and all I got to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.350 
and I know if it does and all I got to
do<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.949> take<00:04:47.159> this<00:04:47.310> cover<00:04:47.580> off<00:04:47.699> and<00:04:47.849> clean<00:04:48.210> up

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
do is take this cover off and clean up

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.930 
do is take this cover off and clean up
the<00:04:48.479> commutator<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.380> it'll<00:04:49.919> it'll<00:04:50.639> work<00:04:50.909> just

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
the commutator and it'll it'll work just

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.909 
the commutator and it'll it'll work just
fine

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
fine

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.310 
fine

all right now I just been kind of

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.189 
all right now I just been kind of
running<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.659> mainly<00:04:57.659> just<00:04:57.870> worrying

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
running it and mainly just worrying

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.420 
running it and mainly just worrying
about<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.560> engine<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:58.949> seeing<00:04:59.159> what<00:04:59.310> the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
about the engine and seeing what the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.670 
about the engine and seeing what the
engines<00:04:59.729> gonna<00:04:59.909> do<00:05:00.150> what<00:05:00.419> so<00:05:00.870> far<00:05:01.169> it's<00:05:01.409> it's

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
engines gonna do what so far it's it's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.060 
engines gonna do what so far it's it's
been<00:05:01.889> coming<00:05:02.159> up<00:05:02.340> roses<00:05:04.669> yeah

but um well yesterday I ran it and it
was<00:05:11.720> coming<00:05:12.020> up<00:05:12.140> -<00:05:12.320> coming<00:05:13.250> up<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.490> 190<00:05:14.260> well<00:05:15.260> it

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
was coming up - coming up to 190 well it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.170 
was coming up - coming up to 190 well it
came<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.770> 180<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.460> then<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.670> thermostat

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
came up to 180 and then the thermostat

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.630 
came up to 180 and then the thermostat
opened<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:17.630> can<00:05:17.660> tell<00:05:18.040> this<00:05:19.040> bottom<00:05:19.430> hose

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
opened you can tell this bottom hose

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.400 
opened you can tell this bottom hose
will<00:05:20.120> heat<00:05:20.300> right<00:05:20.510> up<00:05:20.690> because<00:05:20.870> right<00:05:21.080> there's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
will heat right up because right there's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.200 
will heat right up because right there's
your<00:05:21.620> thermostat<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.550> coming<00:05:22.850> out<00:05:23.000> this

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
your thermostat and it's coming out this

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.140 
your thermostat and it's coming out this
way<00:05:23.450> up<00:05:24.410> through<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.860> radiator<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.610> back

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
way up through the radiator and back

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.930 
way up through the radiator and back
into<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.540> engine<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.400> that<00:05:28.400> hose<00:05:28.580> will<00:05:28.790> heat

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
into the engine and that hose will heat

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.460 
into the engine and that hose will heat
up<00:05:28.970> once<00:05:29.870> your<00:05:29.990> thermostat<00:05:30.470> opens<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:32.470> they

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
up once your thermostat opens so they

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.920 
up once your thermostat opens so they
got<00:05:33.680> up<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:33.860> 190<00:05:34.490> then<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.790> hooked<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.180> battery

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
got up to 190 then I hooked a battery

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.710 
got up to 190 then I hooked a battery
charger<00:05:36.410> up<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.610> fan<00:05:37.850> because<00:05:38.420> it<00:05:38.630> was

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
charger up to the fan because it was

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.060 
charger up to the fan because it was
pretty<00:05:38.930> high<00:05:39.140> yesterday<00:05:39.620> I<00:05:39.650> didn't<00:05:39.890> want<00:05:40.010> to

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
pretty high yesterday I didn't want to

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.270 
pretty high yesterday I didn't want to
overheat<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.600> turned<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:42.020> on<00:05:42.190> 12<00:05:43.190> volts

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
overheat it and I turned it on 12 volts

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.580 
overheat it and I turned it on 12 volts
two<00:05:43.790> amps<00:05:44.210> so<00:05:44.420> the<00:05:44.720> fan<00:05:44.930> was<00:05:45.080> just<00:05:45.290> kind<00:05:45.500> of

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
two amps so the fan was just kind of

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.880 
two amps so the fan was just kind of
running<00:05:46.160> slowly<00:05:46.610> and<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:48.080> pulled<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.710> right

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
running slowly and it pulled it right

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.290 
running slowly and it pulled it right
back<00:05:49.040> down<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.370> 160<00:05:50.120> so<00:05:50.480> I<00:05:50.840> don't<00:05:51.800> see<00:05:52.010> any

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
back down to 160 so I don't see any

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.050 
back down to 160 so I don't see any
problems<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:53.420> the<00:05:53.660> cooling<00:05:54.020> system<00:05:55.060> except

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
problems with the cooling system except

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.090 
problems with the cooling system except
for<00:05:56.270> except<00:05:56.960> for<00:05:56.990> this<00:05:57.200> piece<00:05:57.410> of<00:05:57.590> crap

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
for except for this piece of crap

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.890 
for except for this piece of crap
now<00:05:58.310> I'm<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:58.670> gonna<00:05:58.760> do<00:05:59.030> all<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.360> hoses<00:05:59.570> it's

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
now I'm just gonna do all the hoses it's

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.420 
now I'm just gonna do all the hoses it's
going<00:06:00.020> to<00:06:00.080> get<00:06:00.200> all<00:06:00.260> brand<00:06:00.620> new<00:06:00.800> hoses<00:06:01.250> and

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
going to get all brand new hoses and

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.370 
going to get all brand new hoses and
it's<00:06:02.270> going<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.480> look<00:06:02.600> a<00:06:02.720> hell<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:02.900> lot<00:06:03.170> better

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
it's going to look a hell a lot better

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.850 
it's going to look a hell a lot better
once<00:06:03.620> I'm<00:06:03.800> done<00:06:04.930> this<00:06:05.930> is<00:06:06.110> just<00:06:06.380> the<00:06:06.590> first

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
once I'm done this is just the first

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.810 
once I'm done this is just the first
digit<00:06:09.860> iteration<00:06:11.110> incarnation<00:06:12.110> whatever

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
digit iteration incarnation whatever

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.250 
digit iteration incarnation whatever
this<00:06:13.820> is<00:06:13.880> just<00:06:14.240> for<00:06:14.420> testing<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.230> the

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
this is just for testing this is the

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.810 
this is just for testing this is the
beta<00:06:15.560> version<00:06:15.800> of<00:06:16.070> the<00:06:16.190> cooling<00:06:16.520> system<00:06:17.500> yeah

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
beta version of the cooling system yeah

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.860 
beta version of the cooling system yeah
it<00:06:19.820> ought<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.000> be<00:06:20.120> a<00:06:20.180> hell<00:06:20.420> of<00:06:20.450> a<00:06:20.540> lot<00:06:20.660> better

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
it ought to be a hell of a lot better

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.140 
it ought to be a hell of a lot better
when<00:06:21.020> I'm<00:06:21.170> done<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:21.920> of<00:06:22.580> course<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:23.000> going

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
when I'm done and of course it's going

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.970 
when I'm done and of course it's going
to<00:06:23.210> have<00:06:23.420> gauges<00:06:23.930> on<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.230> it'll<00:06:24.440> have<00:06:24.620> oil

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
to have gauges on it it'll have oil

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.270 
to have gauges on it it'll have oil
temperature<00:06:25.670> voltage<00:06:26.710> of<00:06:27.710> course<00:06:27.980> I<00:06:28.130> don't

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
temperature voltage of course I don't

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.500 
temperature voltage of course I don't
know<00:06:28.340> if<00:06:28.460> I'll<00:06:28.550> have<00:06:28.580> voltage<00:06:28.970> if<00:06:29.240> I<00:06:29.330> don't

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
know if I'll have voltage if I don't

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.720 
know if I'll have voltage if I don't
have<00:06:29.660> an<00:06:29.750> alternator<00:06:30.170> on<00:06:30.380> it<00:06:30.560> so<00:06:31.490> all<00:06:31.580> this

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
have an alternator on it so all this

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.360 
have an alternator on it so all this
really<00:06:31.790> needs<00:06:32.240> to<00:06:32.330> run<00:06:32.630> is<00:06:33.070> this<00:06:34.070> little<00:06:34.340> thing

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
really needs to run is this little thing

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.150 
really needs to run is this little thing
right<00:06:34.730> here<00:06:34.790> that's<00:06:35.570> an<00:06:35.780> electric<00:06:36.160> fuel

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
right here that's an electric fuel

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.730 
right here that's an electric fuel
cutoff<00:06:37.460> it's<00:06:38.060> just<00:06:38.240> a<00:06:38.360> solenoid<00:06:38.690> valve<00:06:38.930> runs

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
cutoff it's just a solenoid valve runs

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.160 
cutoff it's just a solenoid valve runs
off<00:06:39.890> 12<00:06:40.220> volts<00:06:40.580> as<00:06:41.270> long<00:06:41.450> as<00:06:41.570> that<00:06:41.660> stays<00:06:41.960> open

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.170 
off 12 volts as long as that stays open

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.800 
off 12 volts as long as that stays open
the<00:06:42.410> engine<00:06:42.680> will<00:06:42.800> run<00:06:43.480> actually<00:06:44.480> if<00:06:44.570> you<00:06:44.660> have

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
the engine will run actually if you have

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.090 
the engine will run actually if you have
one<00:06:45.020> of<00:06:45.110> these<00:06:45.200> old<00:06:45.260> diesels

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
one of these old diesels

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.640 
one of these old diesels
pretty<00:06:46.520> sure<00:06:46.750> you<00:06:47.750> can<00:06:47.900> take<00:06:48.110> this<00:06:48.290> solenoid

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
pretty sure you can take this solenoid

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.790 
pretty sure you can take this solenoid
out<00:06:49.040> and<00:06:49.310> take<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.670> body<00:06:49.850> or<00:06:50.660> take<00:06:51.080> them<00:06:51.230> take

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
out and take the body or take them take

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.430 
out and take the body or take them take
a<00:06:51.860> piece<00:06:52.130> of<00:06:52.160> the<00:06:52.370> valve<00:06:52.580> out<00:06:52.850> and<00:06:53.360> then<00:06:54.320> you

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
a piece of the valve out and then you

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.810 
a piece of the valve out and then you
can<00:06:54.590> push<00:06:54.830> start<00:06:55.130> it<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:55.370> you<00:06:55.460> can<00:06:55.640> run<00:06:55.790> it

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
can push start it and you can run it

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.640 
can push start it and you can run it
without<00:06:56.000> any<00:06:56.330> electrical<00:06:56.810> system<00:06:57.140> whatsoever

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
without any electrical system whatsoever

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.040 
without any electrical system whatsoever
but<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.520> have<00:06:58.760> to<00:06:58.940> install<00:06:59.270> it<00:06:59.600> to<00:06:59.720> shut<00:06:59.900> it

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
but you have to install it to shut it

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.950 
but you have to install it to shut it
off<00:07:01.000> because<00:07:02.000> then<00:07:02.150> it<00:07:02.270> won't<00:07:02.390> shut<00:07:02.660> off<00:07:02.690> with

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
off because then it won't shut off with

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.090 
off because then it won't shut off with
the<00:07:03.080> key<00:07:04.150> but<00:07:05.150> uh<00:07:05.180> yeah<00:07:05.690> so<00:07:05.960> far<00:07:06.230> I'm<00:07:06.740> I'm

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
the key but uh yeah so far I'm I'm

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.910 
the key but uh yeah so far I'm I'm
pretty<00:07:07.310> happy<00:07:07.580> with<00:07:07.790> the<00:07:07.850> engine<00:07:08.240> and<00:07:08.920> that's

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920 
pretty happy with the engine and that's

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.960 
pretty happy with the engine and that's
about<00:07:10.100> all<00:07:10.220> there<00:07:10.550> is<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:10.760> that

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
about all there is to that

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.480 
about all there is to that
take<00:07:11.240> care
