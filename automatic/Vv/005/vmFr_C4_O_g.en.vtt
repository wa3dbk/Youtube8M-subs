almost<00:01:22.259> halfway<00:01:22.500> through<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.090> like

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
almost halfway through and I was like

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
almost halfway through and I was like
let<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.780> read<00:01:25.259> something<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.890> bit

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
let me read something a little bit

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.499 
let me read something a little bit
lighter<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> that's<00:01:26.610> why<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> reviewed<00:01:27.360> last

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
lighter and that's why I reviewed last

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.330 
lighter and that's why I reviewed last
little<00:01:27.810> blue<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.170> blood<00:01:28.409> before<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.829> reviewed

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
little blue on blood before I reviewed

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.270 
little blue on blood before I reviewed
this<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.470> read<00:01:31.829> something<00:01:32.040> at

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this because I had to read something at

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
this because I had to read something at
least<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.060> lighthearted<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
least a little bit more lighthearted and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.819 
least a little bit more lighthearted and
a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:35.150> sunshiny<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.600> guess<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a little bit more sunshiny I guess so

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.350 
a little bit more sunshiny I guess so
this<00:01:38.009> book<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.549> girl<00:01:38.729> named<00:01:39.000> cat

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.900 
like that like there was this one guy
who<00:05:08.050> had<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.380> roadside<00:05:09.100> stand<00:05:09.490> with<00:05:09.700> his

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
who had the roadside stand with his

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.590 
who had the roadside stand with his
rotten<00:05:10.810> food<00:05:11.050> we<00:05:11.410> did<00:05:11.560> fruit<00:05:12.280> that<00:05:12.730> he<00:05:13.330> didn't

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
rotten food we did fruit that he didn't

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.050 
rotten food we did fruit that he didn't
really<00:05:13.960> know<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.370> know<00:05:15.550> if<00:05:15.640> he<00:05:15.760> was

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
really know that and know if he was

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.720 
really know that and know if he was
conscious<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:17.500> fact<00:05:17.530> that<00:05:17.860> he<00:05:18.010> had<00:05:18.370> rotten

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
conscious of the fact that he had rotten

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.880 
conscious of the fact that he had rotten
fruit<00:05:19.030> because<00:05:19.510> he<00:05:20.020> was<00:05:20.169> hooked<00:05:20.440> on<00:05:20.560> drugs

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
fruit because he was hooked on drugs

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.220 
fruit because he was hooked on drugs
because<00:05:21.280> he<00:05:21.760> lost<00:05:22.090> his<00:05:22.390> family<00:05:22.540> he<00:05:22.930> had<00:05:23.020> lost

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
because he lost his family he had lost

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.480 
because he lost his family he had lost
like<00:05:23.560> pretty<00:05:23.770> much<00:05:23.860> everything<00:05:24.310> that

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
like pretty much everything that

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.280 
like pretty much everything that
mattered<00:05:24.940> to<00:05:25.120> him<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.510> think<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:26.020> lot<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.200> people

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
mattered to him I think a lot of people

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.840 
mattered to him I think a lot of people
will<00:05:26.650> be<00:05:26.710> able<00:05:26.980> to<00:05:27.310> relate<00:05:27.580> to<00:05:27.730> that

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
will be able to relate to that

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.550 
will be able to relate to that
especially<00:05:28.120> with<00:05:28.570> all<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.840> tornadoes<00:05:29.530> that

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
especially with all the tornadoes that

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.880 
especially with all the tornadoes that
swept<00:05:30.070> through<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.430> southeast<00:05:30.910> last<00:05:31.270> week

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
swept through the southeast last week

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.710 
swept through the southeast last week
its<00:05:32.890> just<00:05:33.040> oh<00:05:33.130> like<00:05:33.730> all<00:05:34.060> those<00:05:34.210> people<00:05:34.570> who

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
its just oh like all those people who

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.360 
its just oh like all those people who
lost<00:05:34.930> their<00:05:35.140> homes<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:35.710> I<00:05:35.830> think<00:05:36.070> they'll<00:05:36.250> be

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
lost their homes and I think they'll be

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.150 
lost their homes and I think they'll be
able<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.700> relate<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:37.810> guy<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.500> not

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
able to relate to that guy and not

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.770 
able to relate to that guy and not
necessarily<00:05:39.430> that<00:05:39.940> they're<00:05:40.090> all<00:05:40.180> going<00:05:40.419> into

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
necessarily that they're all going into

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.520 
necessarily that they're all going into
drugs<00:05:41.110> but<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.800> fact<00:05:42.010> that<00:05:42.160> he<00:05:42.840> his<00:05:43.840> wife<00:05:44.050> died

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
drugs but the fact that he his wife died

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.310 
drugs but the fact that he his wife died
and<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.070> was<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.250> big<00:05:46.169> terrible<00:05:47.169> thing<00:05:47.290> that

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
and that was a big terrible thing that

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.409 
and that was a big terrible thing that
happened<00:05:47.440> him<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.070> then<00:05:48.220> a<00:05:48.460> tornado<00:05:49.090> swept

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
happened him and then a tornado swept

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.320 
happened him and then a tornado swept
through<00:05:49.660> their<00:05:50.110> town<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.740> he<00:05:51.280> was<00:05:51.700> trying<00:05:52.150> to
