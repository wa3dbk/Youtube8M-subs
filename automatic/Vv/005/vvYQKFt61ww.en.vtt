here<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:17.170> have<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.800> engine<00:00:19.170> completely<00:00:20.170> back

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
here we have the engine completely back

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.550 
here we have the engine completely back
in<00:00:21.480> everything<00:00:22.480> installed<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:25.439> finally<00:00:26.439> got

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
in everything installed I finally got

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.319 
in everything installed I finally got
the<00:00:26.710> starter<00:00:27.070> to<00:00:27.220> engage<00:00:27.520> I<00:00:27.820> was<00:00:27.910> having<00:00:28.180> some

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
the starter to engage I was having some

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.350 
the starter to engage I was having some
issues<00:00:28.419> with<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.960> starter<00:00:29.849> glad<00:00:30.849> I<00:00:30.880> checked

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
issues with the starter glad I checked

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.350 
issues with the starter glad I checked
that<00:00:31.540> first<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:33.550> not<00:00:33.610> really<00:00:33.850> sure<00:00:34.090> what<00:00:34.270> it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
that first I'm not really sure what it

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.770 
that first I'm not really sure what it
was

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
was

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.360 
was
I<00:00:34.809> think<00:00:35.020> it<00:00:35.110> was<00:00:35.230> some<00:00:35.470> kind<00:00:35.739> of<00:00:35.829> sensor<00:00:36.250> or

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
I think it was some kind of sensor or

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.510 
I think it was some kind of sensor or
whatever<00:00:37.559> vacuum<00:00:38.559> line<00:00:38.770> that<00:00:38.980> wasn't<00:00:39.130> plugged

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
whatever vacuum line that wasn't plugged

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.850 
whatever vacuum line that wasn't plugged
in<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:40.450> was<00:00:40.570> causing<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:41.079> not<00:00:41.260> to<00:00:41.440> actually

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
in that was causing it not to actually

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.880 
in that was causing it not to actually
tell<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:42.970> to<00:00:43.180> roll<00:00:43.450> over<00:00:43.480> but<00:00:44.200> when<00:00:44.650> everything

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
tell it to roll over but when everything

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
tell it to roll over but when everything
I<00:00:45.280> went<00:00:45.430> over<00:00:45.640> everything<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.480> all<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
I went over everything and all of the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.170 
I went over everything and all of the
vacuum<00:00:49.360> lines<00:00:49.810> are<00:00:50.050> correct<00:00:50.380> and<00:00:51.180> everything

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
vacuum lines are correct and everything

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.580 
vacuum lines are correct and everything
else<00:00:52.360> looks<00:00:52.810> like<00:00:53.050> it's<00:00:53.260> correct<00:00:53.680> so<00:00:55.440> put<00:00:56.440> some

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
else looks like it's correct so put some

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.440 
else looks like it's correct so put some
antifreeze<00:00:56.860> in<00:00:57.280> here<00:00:57.550> put<00:00:58.150> some<00:00:58.180> power

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
antifreeze in here put some power

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:08.340 
antifreeze in here put some power
steering<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.290> pump<00:01:00.360> reservoir<00:01:07.350> okay

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
steering in the pump reservoir okay

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.649 
steering in the pump reservoir okay
let's<00:01:08.979> see<00:01:09.880> if<00:01:10.000> this<00:01:10.030> thing<00:01:10.360> is<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.570> to

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
let's see if this thing is going to

00:01:10.659 --> 00:02:16.050 
let's see if this thing is going to
start

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.700 

okay<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:20.000> noise<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.870> was<00:02:21.290> being<00:02:22.250> made<00:02:22.400> from

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
okay the noise that was being made from

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.900 
okay the noise that was being made from
down<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.160> area<00:02:25.610> there<00:02:25.850> was<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:27.910> power

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
down in that area there was the power

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.960 
down in that area there was the power
steering<00:02:29.270> pump<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:30.350> as<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.100> can<00:02:31.280> see<00:02:31.580> there's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
steering pump and as you can see there's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.750 
steering pump and as you can see there's
some<00:02:32.210> nice<00:02:32.450> frothy<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.470> miss<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.100> crap

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
some nice frothy you miss and crap

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.450 
some nice frothy you miss and crap
that's<00:02:35.150> coming<00:02:35.480> over<00:02:35.570> there<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
that's coming over there so that the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.830 
that's coming over there so that the
turkey<00:02:37.910> baster<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:39.190> suck<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.220> air<00:02:40.610> there<00:02:40.880> get

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
turkey baster it suck that air there get

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.630 
turkey baster it suck that air there get
that<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> decent<00:02:42.530> level<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.100> think<00:02:43.220> we're<00:02:43.550> all

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that to a decent level I think we're all

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.540 
that to a decent level I think we're all
good<00:02:43.910> there<00:02:44.150> though<00:02:48.130> everything<00:02:49.130> looks<00:02:49.340> good

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
good there though everything looks good

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.710 
good there though everything looks good
with<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:52.690> cooler<00:02:54.970> we've<00:02:55.970> got<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.240> little<00:02:56.570> too

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
with the cooler we've got a little too

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
with the cooler we've got a little too
much<00:02:56.930> in<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.970> should<00:02:58.970> be<00:02:59.120> good<00:02:59.270> there<00:03:02.740> it

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
much in it but should be good there it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.160 
much in it but should be good there it
is<00:03:04.040> doing<00:03:04.430> something<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.810> didn't

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
is doing something that I didn't

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.970 
is doing something that I didn't
anticipate<00:03:07.690> simply<00:03:08.690> because<00:03:09.050> what<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.830> did

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
anticipate simply because what I did

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.100 
anticipate simply because what I did
here<00:03:10.400> was<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.700> took<00:03:10.780> absolutely<00:03:11.780> everything

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
here was I took absolutely everything

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.380 
here was I took absolutely everything
off<00:03:12.740> of<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:14.120> old<00:03:14.660> engine<00:03:14.930> right<00:03:15.800> over<00:03:16.040> there

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
off of the old engine right over there

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.600 
off of the old engine right over there
and<00:03:18.489> put<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:20.000> engine<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:22.220> only<00:03:22.430> thing

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
and put it on this engine the only thing

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.430 
and put it on this engine the only thing
I<00:03:22.790> wouldn't<00:03:23.300> have<00:03:24.140> changed<00:03:24.590> was<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
I wouldn't have changed was the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.979 
I wouldn't have changed was the
distributor<00:03:28.120> everything<00:03:29.120> else<00:03:29.330> was<00:03:29.570> changed

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
timing belt it had a Maya old engine at

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.170 
timing belt it had a Maya old engine at
a<00:03:33.650> brand<00:03:33.920> new<00:03:33.980> timing<00:03:34.250> belt<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.850> this<00:03:35.000> thing

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
a brand new timing belt on it this thing

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.250 
a brand new timing belt on it this thing
was<00:03:35.330> cracked<00:03:35.630> all<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> hell<00:03:36.110> so<00:03:36.470> I<00:03:36.500> changed<00:03:36.980> it

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
was cracked all the hell so I changed it

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.080 
was cracked all the hell so I changed it
and<00:03:40.750> basically<00:03:41.750> everything<00:03:42.260> basically

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
and basically everything basically

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.720 
and basically everything basically
absolutely<00:03:44.090> everything<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:46.340> what<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:46.640> doing

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
absolutely everything so what it's doing

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.750 
absolutely everything so what it's doing
is<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.470> running<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:49.130> seems<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.670> be

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
is it's running and it seems to be

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.370 
is it's running and it seems to be
running<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.360> idle<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.840> high<00:03:51.140> and<00:03:53.170> then<00:03:54.170> it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
running in the idle and high and then it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.000 
running in the idle and high and then it
seems<00:03:54.800> to<00:03:54.980> kind<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.370> kick<00:03:55.610> down<00:03:58.600> it's<00:03:59.600> not<00:03:59.780> a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
seems to kind of kick down it's not a

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.280 
seems to kind of kick down it's not a
doesn't<00:04:01.010> sound<00:04:01.190> like<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.430> Miss<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:02.870> like

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
doesn't sound like a Miss like it's like

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.009 
doesn't sound like a Miss like it's like
cutting<00:04:03.680> out<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.070> ignition<00:04:04.780> sounds<00:04:05.780> like

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
cutting out the ignition sounds like

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.810 
cutting out the ignition sounds like
it's<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:07.130> think<00:04:07.519> what<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:10.760> a

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
it's I think what it is is the it's a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.720 
it's I think what it is is the it's a
high<00:04:11.000> idle<00:04:11.360> speed<00:04:11.680> sensor<00:04:12.680> trying<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.280> cut<00:04:13.610> it

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
high idle speed sensor trying to cut it

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.120 
high idle speed sensor trying to cut it
down<00:04:13.880> but<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.660> doesn't<00:04:15.440> want<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:15.950> keeps

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
down but it doesn't want to and it keeps

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.949 
down but it doesn't want to and it keeps
coming<00:04:16.430> back<00:04:16.489> on<00:04:16.820> keep<00:04:17.090> coming<00:04:17.120> back<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.720> keep
