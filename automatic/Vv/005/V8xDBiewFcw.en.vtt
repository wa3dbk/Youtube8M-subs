I<00:01:29.200> do<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.860> design<00:01:30.220> I<00:01:30.550> think<00:01:30.580> it's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
I do like the design I think it's

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.670 
I do like the design I think it's
actually<00:01:31.090> pretty<00:01:31.570> cool<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
actually pretty cool and the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.740 
actually pretty cool and the
environments<00:01:33.550> aren't<00:01:33.760> bad<00:01:33.910> either<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
environments aren't bad either the

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.230 
environments aren't bad either the
actual<00:01:35.380> power<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.920> graphics<00:01:36.370> are<00:01:36.550> weak

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
actual power the graphics are weak

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.470 
actual power the graphics are weak
I<00:01:37.270> mean<00:01:37.570> weak<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.230> mean<00:01:38.440> like<00:01:38.940> Dreamcast<00:01:39.940> weak<00:01:40.270> I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
I mean weak I mean like Dreamcast weak I

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.290 
I mean weak I mean like Dreamcast weak I
mean<00:01:40.690> there's<00:01:41.170> actual<00:01:41.770> block<00:01:42.280> fingers<00:01:43.060> and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
mean there's actual block fingers and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.530 
mean there's actual block fingers and
block<00:01:43.930> eyes<00:01:44.790> black<00:01:45.790> hair

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
block eyes black hair

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.450 
block eyes black hair
I<00:01:46.570> mean<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:46.960> actually<00:01:47.440> blocks<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.220> it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
I mean it's actually blocks and it's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.580 
I mean it's actually blocks and it's
just<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.120> this<00:01:49.420> could<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.840> been<00:01:49.870> better<00:01:50.410> as

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
just the this could have been better as

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.040 
just the this could have been better as
a<00:01:50.680> fucking<00:01:51.040> Lego<00:01:51.400> game<00:01:51.610> but<00:01:52.210> yeah<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.870> power

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
a fucking Lego game but yeah the power

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.900 
a fucking Lego game but yeah the power
of<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.320> graphics<00:01:53.710> are<00:01:53.830> extremely<00:01:54.490> weak<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
of the graphics are extremely weak and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.620 
of the graphics are extremely weak and
it's<00:01:55.390> kind<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:55.660> sad<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.900> see<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> 360<00:01:56.680> but<00:01:57.670> the

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it's kind of sad to see on a 360 but the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.330 
it's kind of sad to see on a 360 but the
I<00:01:58.900> think<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> design<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.680> nice<00:02:00.010> but<00:02:00.250> it

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
I think the design is nice but it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.710 
I think the design is nice but it
doesn't<00:02:00.400> save<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:01.030> from<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.360> weak-ass

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
doesn't save it from the weak-ass

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:11.280 
doesn't save it from the weak-ass
graphics<00:02:09.060> okay<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.420> gameplay<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:11.170> is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
graphics okay so this gameplay here is

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.410 
graphics okay so this gameplay here is
the<00:02:11.440> adventure<00:02:11.680> platformer<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.520> that's

the adventure platformer and that's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.280 
the adventure platformer and that's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
basically it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.410

some fun with the first hour or two but

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.440 
some fun with the first hour or two but
I<00:02:44.110> was<00:02:44.350> like<00:02:44.560> by<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.070> third<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.519> like<00:02:45.790> no<00:02:46.120> and

I was like by the third I'm like no and
then<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.690> platform<00:02:46.900> comes<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.500> pain<00:02:47.739> in<00:02:47.830> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
then the platform comes a pain in the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.340 
then the platform comes a pain in the
ass<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.400> I'm<00:02:48.489> like<00:02:48.670> oh<00:02:48.910> god<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.510> keep<00:02:49.840> falling<00:02:50.170> I

keep dying and I can't take this shit

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.080 
keep dying and I can't take this shit
and<00:02:52.620> overall<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.739> gameplay<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.190> progressed

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
and overall the gameplay just progressed

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.020 
and overall the gameplay just progressed
as<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.750> progressed<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.470> got<00:02:56.500> worse<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.250> that's

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
as it progressed it got worse so that's

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.280 
as it progressed it got worse so that's
not<00:02:58.269> really<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.570> good<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:58.959> when<00:02:59.110> it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
not really a good thing when it

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.930 
not really a good thing when it
progresses<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.010> should<00:03:00.250> get<00:03:00.430> better<00:03:00.610> or<00:03:00.850> at

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
progresses it should get better or at

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.860 
progresses it should get better or at
least<00:03:01.090> stay<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.360> same<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.820> mean<00:03:04.450> if<00:03:04.630> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
least stay the same so I mean if you

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.449 
least stay the same so I mean if you
have<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.080> kid<00:03:05.350> around<00:03:05.470> he'll<00:03:05.890> probably<00:03:06.100> love

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
have a kid around he'll probably love

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.949

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
Jack and Dexter or Mario the game is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.570 
Jack and Dexter or Mario the game is
just<00:03:18.610> not<00:03:18.850> very<00:03:19.060> fun<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> platforming<00:03:20.110> is

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
just not very fun the platforming is

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.220 
just not very fun the platforming is
definitely<00:03:21.580> not<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.790> greatest<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.750> gameplay

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
definitely not the greatest the gameplay

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.350 
definitely not the greatest the gameplay
feels<00:03:23.530> old<00:03:23.860> after<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> while<00:03:24.519> it's<00:03:24.820> definitely

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
feels old after a while it's definitely

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.800 
feels old after a while it's definitely
an<00:03:25.420> outdated<00:03:25.870> game<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:27.220> again<00:03:27.760> if<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.600> have<00:03:28.780> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
an outdated game but again if you have a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.210 
an outdated game but again if you have a
kid<00:03:29.140> who<00:03:29.380> just<00:03:29.410> wants<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.890> play<00:03:30.040> some

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
kid who just wants to play some

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.979 
kid who just wants to play some
platforming<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:30.970> doesn't<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.239> Mario<00:03:31.690> or

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
platforming and doesn't have Mario or

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.379 
platforming and doesn't have Mario or
jak<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.620> daxter<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.220> guess<00:03:33.700> this<00:03:33.880> game<00:03:34.090> could

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
jak and daxter I guess this game could

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.120 
jak and daxter I guess this game could
you<00:03:34.720> know<00:03:34.840> fulfill<00:03:35.049> his<00:03:35.320> needs<00:03:35.560> but<00:03:35.829> if<00:03:35.950> you're

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
