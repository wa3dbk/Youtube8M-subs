00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 jan gas tank the mate and you get vivant beautiful this series in which it 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.529
 all done stuff with that and in the first game of this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.689
 episode I play against him 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:13.439
 the prima 10 the very good team actually but at the start of this one 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.920
 episode something very strange happens I had a quarter of a dollar for three years 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.960
 and then he comes to his type and stop stop stop you have to see how 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.090
 hard his goalkeeper john makes the ball shoot out from stomping he is now here 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.429
 on the ground you have to look where it will first hit the ground again 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.890
 and i'm so 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.200
 kro miss but the competition itself was quite exciting because I am in the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.460
 suspicion dean 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.329
 but of course i'm going to be an imminent urbie emanuelson but still i'm coming 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.930
 behind it by louis suares 2 and dune is this moment in the second half of the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.670
 years after being played and stopping and stopping the ball can be such a cross 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.380
 he can shoot the ball in the short corner 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.410
 and I can even show the ball to the left about he can be all residents of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.430
 give you know the right answer sns that land becomes village at a second 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.540
 division and if you're right then you have a chance to win a meet and greet with 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.810
 of course you want no-one less than 10 cents from the city 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 quickly look at the answer 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.050
 at5 who does such a thing and then was one of the few chances on the 2 2 again 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.560
 looked skinny the 2 2 will still come through here I am now know such a tweet 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.530
 then it also seems possible but no 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.680
 the game he has a 2 2 quite well pussy from the connections that stores too 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.690
 I don't think much about doing anything about it and that comes after three games 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.649
 in vision 7, I believe that the US is pretty good on four points 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.520
 is bad and because adherence to that game the swedish malmo injured weak 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.340
 nauseous 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.799
 a second week we do not know I play with 3 10 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.429
 i had a blackout device this is not looking and i can napoli too 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.570
 furthermore that I played just as badly but apparently I have this 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.060
 done but then I have to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.030
 the 10 and 13 is pretty sexy actually compared to my team but then the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.289
 corner it's strike because look 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.930
 basic roy is 80 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.060
 to hold 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.479
 the precise goal goes but of course we never give up and under the influence of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.710
 A pint of music is all silence and that singing career to one of 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.979
 the most beautiful goal of this season 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.689
 the 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.409
 beh 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.839
 3 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:23.659
 beh I am just a bit lucky that no harm but also with this 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.389
 how cool because this is basically the same eats quite the 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.889
 keeper but good this match from a recent un 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.369
 that is a great victory and that means seven points 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.219
 division 7 but why I say that 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.129
 that do not know what you have also continue but in my opinion missed with 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.849
 something else and that was actually speed I had velsen stream space 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.290
 actually not just fast enough for the players to make these decisions with difficulty 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.889
 because thieves hacking fast once and I decide to buy more lottery tickets 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.999
 links with which each case king quickly agree the punishment music with served itself with 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.179
 Dirar Mail and Moeial instead of Assema Line Cruyff 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.489
 where fuck it about that name fortunately never again to pronounce but in the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.629
 first practice game play against a team what we think 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.430
 how old that gives what having seen before that believes because nobody 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.050
 is like e-mail only emotionally with 7 out because that is through and the score from 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.639
 today not only on the scales but also once again in the 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:11.230
 contest 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.600
 super sick and we celebrate it as a huge thing but the golden tip there 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.870
 no safer with the band here is a fantastic wait even though 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.769
 more because it has what it can only go back and forth once 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.109
 one is the hero 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.009
 4 because he decided simply 9 started this game conveniently 2 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:32.419
 the score and of course we are talking about new brand food shank outside 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 a bit so often but I am sure it will be stronger 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.829
 but you know what he is there on the 3 miles yes that's true and I say then 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.989
 just further back 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.370
 hopefully that help is a fact that the truth for designers marquis jolien 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.840
 d'hoore 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.750
 great dribble the defense a little looking I can do it and the 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.579
 makes three one 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.400
 and it was for my purpose to stop these competitions 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.489
 we do not call opponents briefly again as you see but in addition 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.829
 will stay so I want this west with 3 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.529
 great victory well not me but then I have the shots but the other goes 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.150
 camp i am this match i come to ten points and with that is to this 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.249
 episode of both i had fun in this episode our the what 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.019
 shorter taste if you for example go to the rebuild behind you want more 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.519
 read who see how to wait a week and oh yes if you get this video from Germany 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.289
 massively go luyken then I would really be happy that water
