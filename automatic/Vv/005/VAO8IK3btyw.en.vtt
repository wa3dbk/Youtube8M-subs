 the basketball magazine presented by the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.490
 Hello and hello to continue the sixers tv 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 On Rose Monday we have one today 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.119
 guest with us in the studio the past 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 week a very important exclamation point 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.830
 has set because he has his contract 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 will be extended next season too 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.849
 jersey of the middle hessen run up 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 welcome hello anita hello 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.710
 hi am pleased to be here today at 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.380
 Rose Monday, of course, the first question you ask 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 as a native North German you are 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 Carnivalist or honestly so actually 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.980
 not at all in hamburg is not that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 as usual but I have that yesterday 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 already looked at and I must say 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.030
 There were a few funny costumes left 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.950
 work 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.830
 of course pouring here is of course one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.080
 big number carnival mood that gave 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.150
 But it was already on Saturday night in 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.430
 home game against the finke baskets victory 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.180
 after extension but it was very 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.470
 exciting 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 it could not have been so exciting 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.110
 I think we do not have any 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.759
 good first half did not play well 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.229
 defended then we have also clear 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.060
 words in the cabin belongs to ours 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 Coaches have improved us then but 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.869
 At the end we will be back 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.399
 Hardly done a guide again 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.530
 playful and then unfortunately in the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.259
 but then we went 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 but still could decide for us 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 place 4 now for you we look 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 the game again 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.490
 here is our game as always 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.619
 summary for you 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.600
 the fortis xs started well in the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.759
 a fast four turned on 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 zero from the scoreboard is captain 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.790
 often hesse and the british takes off 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.780
 only flying is more beautiful what a prelude 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.450
 in the lot 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.759
 then our studiogast falko serves 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.860
 Partly and the native pourer refuels 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.810
 energetically by the defense after 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.939
 a seven-point run lead the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.830
 Middle Hesse with 13 to 8 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.539
 the baskets did not settle 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.549
 Shake off on the contrary 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.610
 frederik henningsen from the distance 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.500
 brings his team into the lead for the first time 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.269
 the end of the first quarter lead the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.519
 paderborner with forty-two to fortis xs 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.250
 the last will was missing in this phase 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.549
 and the last precision I share here 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.620
 with an unnecessary misspipe 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.170
 it was our studiogast with his 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.890
 Score the turn introduced here 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.410
 24 to 31 and now worked 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 the giessener point by point also 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.730
 if the offensive game continues to stagnate 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.709
 even with the simplest basket maker had to 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.130
 you shiver if the ball really pure 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.530
 going 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.680
 an example of this is the scene from lisch 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.829
 even just before the break at half-time 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.840
 is pour back with 39 to 46 the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.180
 picture also changed initially in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.670
 half two not the forty sixers with 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.620
 much bad luck in the end paderborn on the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.440
 especially with a safe side 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.069
 Hands of beyond 6 meters 75 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.470
 line with a five-point residue 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.049
 It went into the last quarter of the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.150
 its tension and emotion lived times 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.760
 hesse with very important points 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.040
 The distance brings for the first time since 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 In the beginning of the game the leadership for 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.720
 pour back paderborn now seemed the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.180
 to go out in power and they knew that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.859
 merciless use of forty sixers 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.380
 dj oli jou increases to 73 to 67 the 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.440
 complete sports hall east in the victory rush 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.120
 but one had something against tomorrow 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.639
 grim skin shortly before the final siren 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.680
 right one out of eight meets 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.810
 meters to equalize and bring 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.880
 his team with it no longer 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.980
 expected extension hesse again 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.080
 had now thrown the hot 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.620
 National player puts a gap between them 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.300
 down 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:00.400
 this leads to 5 and grandpa born three 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.410
 quarter of the game the momentum on 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.140
 his side had been 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.840
 East Westphalia now in bad luck at the end 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910
 then secure captain saku and hessen the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.580
 win with a lot of routine at the 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.560
 Freestyle win the forty sixers 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.560
 with 90 to 87 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.579
 the main reason for the victory was that we 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.620
 just never gave up and also 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.300
 Joschi was important in the first place 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.590
 extension then we have on 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.940
 Finally finally good in defense 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:55.210
 stood and that gave us the victory 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:57.370
 So the second victory comes in a row 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.750
 for pouring but you have a tight 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.430
 program in front of the breast 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.530
 Tomorrow we will continue with one 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.570
 Home game against Cuxhaven against the have 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.550
 won the match very convincingly 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.680
 that is also the march route of tomorrow 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.690
 Of course we definitely want evening 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.430
 win but I think you can 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.990
 cuxhaven do not underestimate those are 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.780
 Now down in it the fight against 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.330
 descent and just then you know that 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.400
 Teams are often capable of great and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.940
 That's why you definitely can not 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.930
 underestimate 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.000
 they will fight to the last 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.410
 minute it will be a completely different game 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.460
 as the game of play 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.789
 ok the playoffs are within reach 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.889
 Before the season was said in pouring 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.389
 Aim for six to ten now 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.490
 Are you currently in fourth place? 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.930
 Do you have the goals already up there 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.850
 screw or stay on the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.160
 carpet i think the goals will still be 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.420
 Not 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.480
 screwed up we stay on the 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.030
 carpet it would of course be better 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.760
 as the sixth place to reach the end of the 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.430
 season but six to ten is still 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.500
 the objective of course the playoffs 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.180
 but of course we say as a player 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.160
 we too want to be ourselves as well as possible 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.690
 place if then place four out 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.250
 jumps with fate it would be natural 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.960
 Super 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.600
 I mentioned it at the beginning 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.610
 your contract in pouring again a 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.920
 year extended what were the reasons 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.190
 For the first time I feel comfortable here 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.890
 pouring in my first year is back in 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.750
 Germany it was a good good one 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.760
 transition from america to germany 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.160
 but then again, I think that too 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.470
 athletic fits 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.630
 with Dennis as a coach I think that 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.370
 can still evolve me and also 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.960
 the teams that have already signed 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.370
 benny and tk with which I see myself 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.640
 well i think we will be next too 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.280
 year can be a good season from 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.990
 college in america and has the same 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.880
 several offers of different 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.080
 what did he actually associate at that time ? 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.100
 given that you look for 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.730
 have decided to pour 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.590
 i think dennis as a trainer 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.590
 I already saw them playing 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:57.830
 I was small and of course positive 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.440
 was and then the fact that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.440
 I put a lot of playtime into perspective 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.740
 and I think that was one 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.390
 the biggest motivation for me, then 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.370
 like to touch her and pour that fits 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.110
 together apparently that the 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.300
 success story continues we come 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.850
 time for a not so nice topic 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.750
 for you as a hamburger you are namely 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.760
 also football fan and the hsv currently in 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.610
 acute danger of descent do you think that 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.230
 bundesliga-dino packs still looks alright 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.669
 not so good but it is 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.680
 to play a few more games and 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.090
 that is why i have full confidence in the 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.790
 hsv that they are still packing 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.770
 Ok then let's hope that 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.020
 Bundesliga Dino continues in the Bundesliga 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.690

 various carnival events 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.350
 pour around here and then I would 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.750
 I'll be glad if we do it next time 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.650
 issue the pour in front of the sixers tv
