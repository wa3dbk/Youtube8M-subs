00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 day with patricia vélez today we are going to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.140
 join two treats the chocolate and the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 brownies chocolat bears with accents of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.720
 let's see the ingredients two 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.309
 spoonfuls of coffee classic two 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.160
 Scoops of buendía vanilla coffee 125 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.140
 grams or a cup of unsalted butter 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 and another little bit to grease the mold 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.899
 85 grams or a third cup of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.820
 chocolate without sugar 100 grams or three 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.890
 quarts of flour 300 grams or 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 one and a half cup of sugar 3 eggs 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 half a teaspoon of salt and a quarter of 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 cup of water I choose buendía coffee because 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.120
 I just need 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.180
 hot water to release the best 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.490
 taste and the best aroma of pure coffee 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.160
 Colombian to prepare these 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.370
 delicious brownies we must preheat 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.790
 the oven at 180 degrees temperature 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.060
 since we started the preparation 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.430
 previously we must oil the mold 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.150
 I recommend square molds or cans 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.170
 minimum 2 centimeters deep 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.830
 We are going to dilute 4 tablespoons of coffee 2 of 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830
 classic 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.659
 and 2 flavored with water 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.110
 we melted the chocolate and the butter 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.310
 in the microwave we take them for a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.460
 minute and we stir every 30 seconds 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 until fully integrate we add 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.270
 the sugar 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.819
 and now we beat manually 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:24.239
 we are going to add the coffee previously 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.239
 diluted 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.569
 of coffee will not give a touch 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.269
 exceptional different will it be that 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.050
 Our browning are different from 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.360
 everyone else we are going to put the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.360
 eggs one to one 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:04.810
 remember one by one after having 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.459
 placed all the wet ingredients 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.459
 let's put the flour 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.330
 and the little bit of salt 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 and now we are revolving 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.400
 to take the preparation to the can 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.400
 previously greased 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.330
 let's take it to the oven for 20 or 25 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.220
 minutes 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.950
 we should be reviewing after the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.460
 first 15 minutes until the mixture 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.800
 feel firm to the touch remember that 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.070
 a good brown and it must be mercosur or by 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.070
 inside 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.950
 I come from the oven with my brownie I do not know 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.379
 imagine how smells must be delicious 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.959
 let's cool it down a bit then 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.079
 let's start in squares of 4 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.420
 centimeters and then we will serve it and 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.959
 enjoy, I recommend you serve the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.549
 brownie alone or with vanilla ice cream 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.879
 Also, place it in a container 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:22.630
 and take it to give to friends 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:26.680
