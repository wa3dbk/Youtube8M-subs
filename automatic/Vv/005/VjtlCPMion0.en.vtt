00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.620 
the leak between playstation 2 in bison
three<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:49.460> astronomical<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.479> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
three is just astronomical and the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
reason for that is is that the Cell

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.200 
reason for that is is that the Cell

originally we wanted to have a lot of
enemies<00:02:13.989> fighting<00:02:14.410> against<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> game

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
in many of the levels simply because we

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.580 
in many of the levels simply because we

and<00:02:49.760> last<00:02:50.030> question<00:02:50.120> because<00:02:50.600> it's<00:02:50.780> been<00:02:50.930> such

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
and last question because it's been such

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.780 
and last question because it's been such
a<00:02:51.170> different<00:02:51.590> game<00:02:51.770> than<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.370> previous<00:02:52.670> eyes

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
a different game than the previous eyes

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.070 
a different game than the previous eyes
of<00:02:52.970> legend<00:02:53.300> clanking<00:02:53.690> things<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:53.960> that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
of legend clanking things like that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.630 
of legend clanking things like that
what's<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:54.650> been<00:02:54.740> like<00:02:54.800> developing<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.460> game

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
what's it been like developing this game

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.790 
what's it been like developing this game
has<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.850> been<00:02:56.000> really<00:02:56.780> super<00:02:57.080> fun<00:02:57.320> has<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.650> been

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
has it been really super fun has it been

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.650 
has it been really super fun has it been
like<00:02:57.980> tapping<00:02:58.400> into<00:02:58.670> things<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.030> you've<00:02:59.240> not

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660

have an opportunity to do that what's

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.940 
have an opportunity to do that what's
the<00:03:02.900> development<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.470> I've<00:03:03.650> been<00:03:03.830> like

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
the development of this I've been like

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.770 
the development of this I've been like
for<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> team<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:05.180> been<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> blast<00:03:05.480> I

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
it's been exhilarating and extremely

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's been exhilarating and extremely
challenging<00:03:10.790> at<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:10.970> same<00:03:11.030> time<00:03:11.420> simply

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
challenging at the same time simply

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.620 
challenging at the same time simply
because<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.530> moved<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.460> a<00:03:13.490> new<00:03:13.550> platform<00:03:13.880> we

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
because we moved on to a new platform we

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.510 
because we moved on to a new platform we
moved<00:03:14.810> into<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.080> new<00:03:15.320> genre<00:03:15.350> or<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.370> was

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
moved into a new genre or one that was

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.880 
moved into a new genre or one that was
relatively<00:03:17.000> new<00:03:17.180> for<00:03:17.360> us<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.780> we<00:03:18.710> were

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
relatively new for us and we were

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.460 
relatively new for us and we were
dealing<00:03:19.130> with<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.880> launch<00:03:20.240> title<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:21.290> all<00:03:21.440> of

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
dealing with a launch title but all of

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.110 
dealing with a launch title but all of
those<00:03:21.709> put<00:03:21.980> together<00:03:22.070> gave<00:03:22.880> us<00:03:23.000> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
those put together gave us the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.760 
those put together gave us the
opportunity<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.750> do<00:03:24.080> things<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.560> didn't

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
opportunity to do things that we didn't

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.440 
opportunity to do things that we didn't
even<00:03:24.890> think<00:03:24.980> we<00:03:25.160> could<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.790> our<00:03:25.850> own<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
even think we could do on our own and

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.470 
even think we could do on our own and
it's<00:03:26.930> been<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.590> lot<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.190> fun<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.730> see<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.120> evolve

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
it's been a lot of fun to see it evolve

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.170 
it's been a lot of fun to see it evolve
to<00:03:30.260> what<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.620> today<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:31.100> we're<00:03:31.760> very<00:03:31.790> proud
