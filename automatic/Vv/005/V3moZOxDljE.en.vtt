basic<00:02:49.810> recipe<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> think<00:02:51.610> his

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
basic recipe that I think his

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.210 
basic recipe that I think his
grandfather<00:02:52.810> grandmother<00:02:53.260> somebody<00:02:53.740> had

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
grandfather grandmother somebody had

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.670 
grandfather grandmother somebody had
done<00:02:54.490> when<00:02:54.760> he<00:02:54.820> was<00:02:54.970> kid<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.420> when<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> guy<00:02:56.530> was

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
done when he was kid so when the guy was

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.890 
done when he was kid so when the guy was
a<00:02:56.740> kid<00:02:56.920> he<00:02:57.640> learned<00:02:58.120> from<00:02:58.210> his<00:02:58.330> grandparents

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
a kid he learned from his grandparents

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.190 
a kid he learned from his grandparents
so<00:02:59.800> I<00:02:59.830> thought<00:03:00.040> I'd<00:03:00.190> give<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.430> shot<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.210> had

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
so I thought I'd give it a shot I had

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.550 
so I thought I'd give it a shot I had
all<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:02.980> stuff<00:03:03.480> basically<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:05.230> she<00:03:05.260> did<00:03:05.950> to

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
all the stuff basically that she did to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
all the stuff basically that she did to
it<00:03:08.560> was<00:03:08.650> very<00:03:08.860> simple<00:03:09.130> probably<00:03:09.550> got<00:03:09.730> less

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
it was very simple probably got less

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.840 
it was very simple probably got less
than<00:03:10.000> probably<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:11.010> know<00:03:12.010> less<00:03:12.340> than<00:03:12.370> ten<00:03:12.670> bucks

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
than probably I know less than ten bucks

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.400 
than probably I know less than ten bucks
in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> ingredients<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> wasn't<00:03:14.170> much<00:03:14.260> it

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
in the ingredients so it wasn't much it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
gonna try it it's pretty much just a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.190 
gonna try it it's pretty much just a
couple<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.209> cans<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.810> Welch's<00:03:50.560> grape<00:03:50.590> juice<00:03:51.040> a

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
they got a balloon wine and basically

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.680 
they got a balloon wine and basically
you<00:04:20.650> take<00:04:20.799> an<00:04:20.950> old<00:04:21.100> like<00:04:21.669> a<00:04:21.700> bottle<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.570> know

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.080 
you take an old like a bottle you know
bottles<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.380> most<00:04:23.590> people<00:04:23.830> use

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
bottles that most people use

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.700 
bottles that most people use
the<00:04:24.210> stuff<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.630> stretch<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> heavy-duty

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
balloon on it and the blend expands when

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580 
balloon on it and the blend expands when
your<00:04:28.650> mix<00:04:29.040> releases<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.000> co2<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.750> that's<00:04:31.470> how

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
your mix releases the co2 and that's how

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.200 
your mix releases the co2 and that's how
it's<00:04:31.740> contained<00:04:31.889> but<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.340> chose<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:33.000> use<00:04:33.180> a

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
it's contained but I chose to use a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.370 
it's contained but I chose to use a
little<00:04:36.210> different<00:04:36.870> system<00:04:37.169> here<00:04:37.320> which

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
little different system here which

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.450 
little different system here which
you'll<00:04:37.530> see<00:04:37.710> it's<00:04:37.830> pretty<00:04:38.010> common<00:04:38.220> anyway

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
you'll see it's pretty common anyway

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.400 
you'll see it's pretty common anyway
basically<00:04:39.210> just<00:04:39.510> got<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.690> tube<00:04:39.930> coming<00:04:40.169> out<00:04:40.320> the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
basically just got a tube coming out the

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.530 
basically just got a tube coming out the
top<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.800> bucket<00:04:41.550> going<00:04:41.940> into<00:04:42.180> some<00:04:42.330> water

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
top of the bucket going into some water

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.909 
top of the bucket going into some water
and<00:04:43.370> that's<00:04:44.370> what<00:04:44.490> I'm<00:04:44.580> doing<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:44.940> here<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.419> is

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.420 

and<00:04:49.919> I'm<00:04:50.669> sure<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.270> hear<00:04:51.449> it<00:04:52.430> probably

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
and I'm sure you can hear it probably

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.490 
and I'm sure you can hear it probably
see<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.580> bubbles<00:04:53.820> coming<00:04:54.210> up<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:57.380> since<00:04:58.380> we

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
see the bubbles coming up so since we

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.080 
see the bubbles coming up so since we
have<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.650> white<00:04:58.860> carpet<00:04:59.280> I<00:05:01.850> thought<00:05:02.850> it<00:05:02.970> might

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
have a white carpet I thought it might

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.170 
have a white carpet I thought it might
be<00:05:03.240> best<00:05:03.389> to<00:05:03.510> put<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.780> in<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.490> cooler<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.030> can

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
be best to put it in a cooler so I can

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.180 
be best to put it in a cooler so I can
shut<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.419> lid<00:05:06.570> when<00:05:06.780> I'm<00:05:06.870> not<00:05:06.990> around<00:05:07.190> okay

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
shut the lid when I'm not around okay

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.500 
shut the lid when I'm not around okay
