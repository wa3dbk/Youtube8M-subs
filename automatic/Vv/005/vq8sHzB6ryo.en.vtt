before I'm just repeating myself on well

Sean what up on the Brian right now I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.360 
Sean what up on the Brian right now I
got<00:00:43.260> three<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> these<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.890> babies<00:00:44.190> um

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
got three of these little babies um

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
got three of these little babies um
there's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.000> sample<00:00:45.539> sizes<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
there's a little sample sizes but this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.799 
there's a little sample sizes but this
is<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> zero<00:00:47.670> black<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> clinic

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
is just a zero black it's the clinic

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
is just a zero black it's the clinic
high<00:00:49.140> impact<00:00:50.059> mascara<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:54.149> three<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
high impact mascara and I got three of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
high impact mascara and I got three of
these<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> ebay<00:00:55.289> uh<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.610> six<00:00:56.879> dollars

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
these off of ebay uh for six dollars

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.060 
these off of ebay uh for six dollars
total<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:58.890> deal

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
total I think so that's pretty good deal

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.279 
total I think so that's pretty good deal
because<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> these<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.289> sixteen

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
because one of these is like sixteen

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.410 
because one of these is like sixteen
dollars<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.010> three<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.059> probably

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
dollars so three of these probably

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280 
dollars so three of these probably
together<00:01:03.960> equals<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:07.110> object

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
together equals one so I I don't object

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
together equals one so I I don't object
again<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> video<00:01:08.159> que<00:01:08.369> zip<00:01:09.150> Juan<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.780> just

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
again to the video que zip Juan is just

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.609 
again to the video que zip Juan is just
a<00:01:10.140> natural<00:01:10.409> bristle<00:01:11.130> brush<00:01:12.000> wand<00:01:12.780> thingy<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
a natural bristle brush wand thingy and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.380 
a natural bristle brush wand thingy and
I<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> sample<00:01:15.240> size

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I like that I got the sample size

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.969 
I like that I got the sample size
because<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.840> smaller<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.259> could<00:01:16.530> fit<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:16.860> my

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
because it's smaller I could fit into my

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.999 
because it's smaller I could fit into my
lashes<00:01:17.159> better<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:19.290> brush<00:01:19.470> itself<00:01:19.770> isn't

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
lashes better and the brush itself isn't

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
lashes better and the brush itself isn't
smaller<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.390> wand

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
smaller but a little you know the wand

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.859 
smaller but a little you know the wand
is<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.259> makes<00:01:22.500> sense<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.509> I'm<00:01:24.509> real

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
is if that makes sense and I'm real

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.660 
is if that makes sense and I'm real
excited<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.409> shoot<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.220> looks

out<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.049> make<00:01:58.229> them<00:01:58.350> look

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
out a little bit more and make them look

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.870 
out a little bit more and make them look
even<00:01:58.590> thick<00:01:58.920> thicker<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.610> put<00:01:59.850> your

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
even thick thicker when you do put your

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.300 
even thick thicker when you do put your
mascara<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.619> let<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.009> know<00:02:02.100> that's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
mascara on so just let you know that's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.459 
mascara on so just let you know that's
what<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.490> do<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.630> eyes<00:02:03.780> otherwise<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
what I do have on my eyes otherwise I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.819 
what I do have on my eyes otherwise I
just<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.770> eyeshadow<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.829> curl

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
just have eyeshadow on I'm going to curl

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.919 
just have eyeshadow on I'm going to curl
my<00:02:07.860> eyelashes<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> Revlon

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
my eyelashes with the Revlon

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.509 
my eyelashes with the Revlon
curler<00:02:10.170> first<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.129> I'll<00:02:11.219> apply<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
curler first and then I'll apply the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.759 
curler first and then I'll apply the
mascara<00:02:12.000> okay<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.659> my<00:02:12.870> lashes<00:02:13.049> have<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.409> curl

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
mascara okay so my lashes have a curl

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.240 
mascara okay so my lashes have a curl
now<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.400> they're<00:02:14.700> definitely<00:02:15.680> more<00:02:16.680> visible

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
now and they're definitely more visible

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.550 
now and they're definitely more visible
I<00:02:17.489> don't<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.969> the<00:02:18.329> shortest<00:02:18.900> lashes<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:19.500> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I don't have the shortest lashes but I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.199 
I don't have the shortest lashes but I
also<00:02:19.739> don't<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.280> longest<00:02:20.579> lashes<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
also don't have the longest lashes I

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.140 
also don't have the longest lashes I
just<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.049> I<00:02:22.260> would<00:02:22.769> say<00:02:22.950> average<00:02:23.129> lashes<00:02:23.849> so

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
just have I would say average lashes so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.000

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
applying it and see see what I think

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:52.220 
applying it and see see what I think
okay<00:02:50.209> that's<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.329> one<00:02:51.629> coat<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.079> this

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
okay that's just one coat of this

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
okay that's just one coat of this
mascara<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:53.129> is<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.340> very<00:02:53.700> um<00:02:54.079> like<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:56.099> know

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
mascara it is a very um like you know

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.339 
mascara it is a very um like you know
it's<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.609> stuffing<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.419> a<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:57.659> wet<00:02:57.870> formula

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
it's that stuffing on a very wet formula

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.929 
it's that stuffing on a very wet formula
so<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.590> definitely<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.219> about<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.519> and

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
so I definitely like that about it and

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.140 
so I definitely like that about it and
any<00:03:00.930> bristles<00:03:01.379> are<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.560> thick<00:03:02.219> so<00:03:02.639> it<00:03:02.790> gets

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
any bristles are very thick so it gets

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.990 
any bristles are very thick so it gets
through<00:03:03.419> every<00:03:03.810> lash<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.730> creates<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.819> lot<00:03:05.969> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
through every lash and creates a lot of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.990 
through every lash and creates a lot of
volume<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.689> well<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.019> length<00:03:07.349> so<00:03:07.889> I<00:03:08.129> definitely

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
volume as well as length so I definitely

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.259 
volume as well as length so I definitely
like<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:09.989> vas<00:03:10.230> Kara<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.609> comparable
