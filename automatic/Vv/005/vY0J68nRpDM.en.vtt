 Hi, I'm Jeff and I have Corsair products here. Let me introduce you to the mid-tower Carbide Series SPEC 01, SPEC 02 and SPEC 03 cabinets. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 SPEC 01 is equipped with side panels that allow easy access without tools. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 There are four combo drive shafts that can accommodate both 3.5-inch hard drives and 2.5-inch SSDs. Hard disk installation does not require use 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 In addition, SPEC 02 has two tool-free expansion slots, a rear exhaust fan, and SSD mounts, even without tools. There are three available 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 There are six mounts for fans for potential cooling. There are two USB 3.0 ports on the front panel. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 SPEC 03 has the same characteristics as SPEC 02 but a more aggressive appearance. SPEC 03 comes in several different versions - with red, white, orange or blue LED fans and LED power indicators. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This is the system I assembled into the SPEC 02 model. Unlike many other cabinets in this price range, this model has a cable management system that ensures a clean look and keep the cables out of the airflow path. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 The dust filter on the front suction also contributes to interior cleanliness. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 The kit includes a Corsair RM550 power supply, a Gigabyte Z87 motherboard, and a Sapphire Radeon HD7950 GPU. It has a low-profile Vengeance memory and storage capacity is handled by the Corsair Neutron SSD. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 The SPEC 02 model has excellent cooling by default, but here we have added the Hydro Series H80i for CPU cooling and noise reduction. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I built a very nice system using the SPEC 02 enclosure. It is great on SPEC cabinets that you can start with a basic set and over time you have a number of opportunities to upgrade to modern hardware without having to replace the cabinet. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
