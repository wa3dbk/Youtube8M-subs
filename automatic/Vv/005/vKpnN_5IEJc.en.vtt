00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
hello this is going to be a an example

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.900 
hello this is going to be a an example
solve<00:00:06.000> for<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.230> room<00:00:07.680> method<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.309> solving<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
solve for the room method of solving the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.350 
solve for the room method of solving the
rubik's<00:00:09.750> cube<00:00:10.160> so<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.519> kinda<00:00:11.849> I'm<00:00:12.120> just

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
rubik's cube so it's kinda I'm just

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.270 
rubik's cube so it's kinda I'm just
going<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.509> give<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> general<00:00:13.080> review<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.799> show

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
going to give a general review and show

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
going to give a general review and show
you<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:14.549> i<00:00:14.580> would<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.389> cases<00:00:15.780> that

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
you what i would do in the cases that

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.200 
you what i would do in the cases that
come<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.730> first<00:00:17.880> thing<00:00:17.970> i<00:00:18.119> want

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
come up here so the first thing i want

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.010 
come up here so the first thing i want
to<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.449> find<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:20.359> make<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> block<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> left

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to do is find a make a block on the left

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.019 
to do is find a make a block on the left
side<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.400> my<00:00:23.550> orange

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
side which is going to be my orange

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.330 
side which is going to be my orange
since<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.680> some<00:00:25.680> stuff<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.160> already

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
since I see some stuff that's already

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.320 
since I see some stuff that's already
lined<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> want<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> start<00:00:30.119> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
lined up for it I you want to start this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.089 
lined up for it I you want to start this
most<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.170> unless<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.890> see<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
most of time unless you can just see it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.780 
most of time unless you can just see it
by<00:00:32.850> making<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.420> two<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.870> two<00:00:33.899> by<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.980> then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
by making a two by two by one and then

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.930 
by making a two by two by one and then
extending<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> block<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.500> i<00:00:37.860> put<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> edge<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
extending the block so i put the edge in

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.860 
extending the block so i put the edge in
there<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.530> pair<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.129> here

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
there because i see this pair right here

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.950 
there because i see this pair right here
that's<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:43.079> by<00:00:43.320> two<00:00:43.379> by<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.809> i'm

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that's my two by two by one and now i'm

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.940 
that's my two by two by one and now i'm
looking<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> rest<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.149> block<00:00:48.950> which

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
looking for the rest of that block which

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.950 
looking for the rest of that block which
is<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.930> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
is right here and right here so what I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
is right here and right here so what I
want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:57.949> it<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
want to do is make it so that I can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.649 
want to do is make it so that I can
match<00:00:59.699> those<00:00:59.969> up<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.530> oops

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
match those up like that and then oops

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.260 
match those up like that and then oops
insert<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.530> finish<00:01:07.770> off<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.100> block<00:01:08.310> right

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
insert that to finish off my block right

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
insert that to finish off my block right
there<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> that's<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> left<00:01:11.070> side<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.490> now

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
there so that's on the left side so now

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
there so that's on the left side so now
you<00:01:11.670> want<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> move<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.930> block

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you want to move on to the right block

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.690 
you want to move on to the right block
which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:16.580> red<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.939> case<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.640> go<00:01:20.640> ahead

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
which is a red in this case so go ahead

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.300 
which is a red in this case so go ahead
and<00:01:20.850> move<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.270> edge<00:01:21.509> over<00:01:21.900> there<00:01:22.049> because

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
and move my edge over there because

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.980 
and move my edge over there because
we're<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:25.070> rotating<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.990> make

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
we're going to be rotating this to make

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.640 
we're going to be rotating this to make
that<00:01:28.229> block<00:01:28.530> anyway<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:30.930> I've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that block anyway so now I've got that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
that block anyway so now I've got that
edge<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.040> place<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:32.640> isn't<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> prerequisite

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
edge in place which isn't a prerequisite

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.590 
edge in place which isn't a prerequisite
it<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.439> happened<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.009> fit<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.299> salt

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it just happened to fit in and this salt

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.069 
it just happened to fit in and this salt
and<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.860> finish<00:01:38.670> off<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:39.960> by

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and then finish off that two by two by

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.580 
and then finish off that two by two by
one<00:01:40.829> block<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:42.680> now<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.390> see<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.720> corner<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
one block and now I see the corner I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.910 
one block and now I see the corner I
need<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.630> edge<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
need is right here and then the edge I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.999 
need is right here and then the edge I
need<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.590> since<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
need is right here and since this is a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.560 
need is right here and since this is a
white<00:01:53.640> corner<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.710> want<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:56.520> move<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.540> of

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
white corner I want to move it out of

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.020 
white corner I want to move it out of
the<00:01:57.750> way<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.590> an<00:01:58.680> m2<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.549> bring<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the way so I can do an m2 to bring the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
the way so I can do an m2 to bring the
block<00:02:00.390> colour<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> side<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
block colour on to the side so that I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.709 
block colour on to the side so that I
can<00:02:02.399> mash<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:05.270> f2l<00:02:06.270> pair<00:02:06.270> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
can mash this up like a f2l pair and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.160 
can mash this up like a f2l pair and
just<00:02:06.930> insert<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.509> all<00:02:09.509> right<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
just insert it like that all right so

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.690 
just insert it like that all right so
now<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
now this is a

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.699 
now this is a
my<00:02:13.270> first<00:02:13.569> two<00:02:13.690> blocks<00:02:13.900> are<00:02:14.080> done<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
my first two blocks are done so now I

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.589 
my first two blocks are done so now I
have<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.099> move<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.520> see<00:02:15.760> ml<00:02:16.030> 0<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.450> is

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
have to move on to see ml 0 which is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.759 
have to move on to see ml 0 which is
orienting<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.590> permuting<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.519> last<00:02:19.269> layer

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
orienting and permuting the last layer

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.619 
orienting and permuting the last layer
so<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.450> was<00:02:22.569> not<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> last<00:02:23.080> layer<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.709> last

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
so it was not the last layer the last

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.830 
so it was not the last layer the last
corners<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.129> a<00:02:27.760> case<00:02:28.090> where<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
corners so this is a case where you

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.210 
corners so this is a case where you
recognize<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.560> by<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.700> diagonal<00:02:31.800> hairs<00:02:32.800> and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
recognize it by the diagonal hairs and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.059 
recognize it by the diagonal hairs and
it's<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:34.390> orientation<00:02:35.200> there's<00:02:35.950> a

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
it's a you orientation there's a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.160 
it's a you orientation there's a
matching<00:02:36.550> diagonal<00:02:37.150> pairs<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> want<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
matching diagonal pairs so you want to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.539 
matching diagonal pairs so you want to
do<00:02:38.340> are<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:40.049> be<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:41.290> our<00:02:42.900> YouTube<00:02:44.190> l<00:02:45.190> prime<00:02:46.349> d2l

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
do are to be to our YouTube l prime d2l

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.059 
do are to be to our YouTube l prime d2l
you<00:02:48.549> two<00:02:48.790> are<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.319> now<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:51.040> that

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
you two are and now you can see that

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.940 
you two are and now you can see that
with<00:02:51.340> respect<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.849> each<00:02:51.940> other<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.950> corners

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
with respect to each other the corners

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.870 
with respect to each other the corners
are<00:02:54.099> all<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.760> right<00:02:54.940> position<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.620> now<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
are all in the right position so now the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.589 
are all in the right position so now the
next<00:02:57.880> step<00:02:58.090> here<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:59.880> orienting<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.090> last<00:03:01.329> six

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
next step here is orienting the last six

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.520 
next step here is orienting the last six
edges<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:03.959> these<00:03:04.959> are<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.519> cyclical

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
edges and these are it's just a cyclical

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.890 
edges and these are it's just a cyclical
kind<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.650> pattern<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.670> follow<00:03:10.299> not

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
kind of pattern you have to follow not

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.390 
kind of pattern you have to follow not
really<00:03:11.110> proud<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.349> their<00:03:11.590> cases<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.099> come<00:03:12.250> up

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
really proud of their cases that come up

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.569 
really proud of their cases that come up
and<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:13.360> an<00:03:13.510> algorithm<00:03:13.870> which<00:03:14.349> is<00:03:15.280> usually

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
and you do an algorithm which is usually

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.150 
and you do an algorithm which is usually
just<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:15.849> M<00:03:16.030> Prime<00:03:16.390> um<00:03:16.900> Prime<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:18.040> get

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
just like M Prime um Prime and you get

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.500 
just like M Prime um Prime and you get
another<00:03:18.370> case<00:03:18.609> you<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.910> do<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.150> until

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
another case you just do that until

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.170 
another case you just do that until
they're<00:03:19.690> all<00:03:19.810> your<00:03:20.799> top<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.100> bottom<00:03:21.670> color<00:03:21.850> so

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
they're all your top and bottom color so

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.490 
they're all your top and bottom color so
my<00:03:22.450> top<00:03:22.660> bottom<00:03:23.049> bar<00:03:23.260> yellow<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.069> white<00:03:24.450> so

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
my top bottom bar yellow and white so

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.860 
my top bottom bar yellow and white so
these<00:03:26.500> are<00:03:26.670> yellow<00:03:27.670> or<00:03:27.880> white<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.329> these<00:03:28.690> are

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
these are yellow or white and these are

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.479 
these are yellow or white and these are
all<00:03:28.930> yellow<00:03:29.230> or<00:03:29.440> white<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.160> how<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.340> know

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
all yellow or white so it's how you know

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.979 
all yellow or white so it's how you know
it's<00:03:30.670> done<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.930> now<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.530> want<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.480> solve<00:03:34.480> your

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
it's done so now you want to solve your

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.099 
it's done so now you want to solve your
side<00:03:38.100> edges<00:03:39.269> along<00:03:40.269> with<00:03:40.480> their<00:03:40.600> corners<00:03:40.959> so

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
side edges along with their corners so

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.020 
side edges along with their corners so
you<00:03:41.170> kind<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.500> make<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.920> two<00:03:42.160> sides<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:42.910> if

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
you kind of make the two sides so if

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.370 
you kind of make the two sides so if
you're<00:03:43.150> looking<00:03:43.269> at<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.569> display<00:03:43.840> you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
you're looking at the display you

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.960 
you're looking at the display you
actually<00:03:44.650> solving<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.069> bottom<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.940> top

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
actually solving the bottom and the top

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.180 
actually solving the bottom and the top
layer<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:47.380> it's<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:47.709> going<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:47.889> be<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
layer but it's just going to be the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.039 
layer but it's just going to be the
right<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.700> left<00:03:48.730> side<00:03:49.060> for<00:03:49.450> us<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.900> bring<00:03:52.900> that

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
right and left side for us so bring that

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.240 
right and left side for us so bring that
down<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:55.329> put<00:03:56.109> them<00:03:56.200> diagonal<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.980> each<00:03:57.069> other

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
down you put them diagonal to each other

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.099 
down you put them diagonal to each other
so<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.430> when<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:57.730> do<00:03:57.880> this<00:03:58.060> they're<00:03:58.569> both<00:03:58.780> on

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
so that when you do this they're both on

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.009 
so that when you do this they're both on
the<00:03:59.440> bottom<00:03:59.829> where<00:04:00.760> it's<00:04:01.120> free<00:04:01.329> to<00:04:01.389> manipulate

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
the bottom where it's free to manipulate

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.559 
the bottom where it's free to manipulate
them<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.319> match<00:04:02.530> them<00:04:02.709> up<00:04:02.739> like<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.569> that

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
them to match them up like this and that

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.160 
them to match them up like this and that
was<00:04:04.750> done<00:04:04.959> by<00:04:06.180> putting<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.269> opposite<00:04:07.720> corners

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
was done by putting the opposite corners

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.280 
was done by putting the opposite corners
where<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:09.419> opposite<00:04:10.419> corners<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.959> bottom

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
where the opposite corners of the bottom

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.839 
where the opposite corners of the bottom
edge<00:04:11.440> right<00:04:11.590> here<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.489> when<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.669> do<00:04:12.760> an

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
edge right here so that when you do an

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.560 
edge right here so that when you do an
m2<00:04:13.090> they<00:04:13.239> match<00:04:13.419> up<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:15.190> right<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:16.150> knew

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
m2 they match up all right so I knew

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.339 
m2 they match up all right so I knew
that<00:04:17.729> now<00:04:18.729> you<00:04:18.789> want<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.150> permute<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.690> last

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
that now you want to permute the last

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.999 
that now you want to permute the last
four<00:04:21.159> edges<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:22.450> believe<00:04:22.720> it'll<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:23.140> so

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:26.009 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.170 

this<00:04:27.009> is<00:04:27.190> just<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.490> case<00:04:27.669> where<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.000> that

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
this is just a case where you do that

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.700 
this is just a case where you do that
and<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.770> that's<00:04:29.949> a<00:04:30.220> quick<00:04:30.639> example<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.389> how<00:04:32.380> at

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
and so that's a quick example of how at

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.439 
and so that's a quick example of how at
least<00:04:32.889> I<00:04:33.039> solve<00:04:33.639> with<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.910> room<00:04:34.060> method<00:04:34.360> I'm

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
least I solve with the room method I'm

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.200 
least I solve with the room method I'm
sure<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.900> there's<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.400> lot<00:04:36.400> more<00:04:36.460> efficient

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
sure that there's a lot more efficient

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.719 
sure that there's a lot more efficient
ways<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.479> doing<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.930> as<00:04:38.139> seen<00:04:39.130> by<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.400> fact

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
ways of doing it as seen by the fact
