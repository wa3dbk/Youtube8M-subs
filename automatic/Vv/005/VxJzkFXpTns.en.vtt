enough time if English flow

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.090 
enough time if English flow
I<00:06:32.370> got<00:06:33.090> there<00:06:33.240> around<00:06:33.330> nine<00:06:33.800> when<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:34.860> park

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
I got there around nine when the park

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.240 
I got there around nine when the park
usually<00:06:35.490> opens<00:06:35.880> and<00:06:36.120> then<00:06:36.390> I<00:06:36.570> got<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:37.860> depart

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
usually opens and then I got to depart

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:45.170 
usually opens and then I got to depart
probably<00:06:38.730> 911<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:43.280> it<00:06:44.280> closes<00:06:44.640> at<00:06:44.880> noon

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180
