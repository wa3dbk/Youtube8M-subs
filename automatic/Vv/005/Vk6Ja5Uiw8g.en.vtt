they've<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.430> Springboks<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.090> think<00:00:43.270> we<00:00:43.330> could

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
they've the Springboks I think we could

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.710 
probably see the high ball here there's
a<00:00:45.190> criticism<00:00:45.489> last<00:00:45.910> week<00:00:46.150> Chris<00:00:46.510> Patterson

a criticism last week Chris Patterson
didn't<00:00:47.200> get<00:00:47.290> under<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.590> high<00:00:47.710> ball<00:00:47.980> that<00:00:48.160> led

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
didn't get under the high ball that led

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.700 
didn't get under the high ball that led
to<00:00:48.510> Richard<00:00:49.510> Kuh<00:00:49.660> who's<00:00:49.809> trying<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.260> start<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
to Richard Kuh who's trying to start the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.280 
to Richard Kuh who's trying to start the
second<00:00:51.100> half<00:00:51.129> and<00:00:51.670> he<00:00:52.210> really<00:00:52.720> attacked<00:00:53.080> this

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
second half and he really attacked this

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.680 
second half and he really attacked this
he<00:00:53.470> kept<00:00:53.710> his<00:00:53.860> eye<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.129> ball<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.790> then<00:00:55.510> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
he kept his eye in the ball and then the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.829 
he kept his eye in the ball and then the
contact<00:00:56.350> their<00:00:57.239> shoulder<00:00:58.239> into<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.540> face

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
contact their shoulder into the face

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.259 
contact their shoulder into the face
there<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.140> think<00:00:59.440> probably<00:00:59.739> but<00:01:00.370> when<00:01:01.180> that

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
there I think probably but when that

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.030 
there I think probably but when that
ball<00:01:01.480> was<00:01:01.660> turned<00:01:01.900> over<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.440> was<00:01:02.830> really

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
ball was turned over I was really

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.829 
ball was turned over I was really
concerned<00:01:03.339> because<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.059> Springboks<00:01:04.510> had<00:01:04.690> an

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
concerned because the Springboks had an

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.170 
concerned because the Springboks had an
awful<00:01:05.290> lot<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.470> numbers<00:01:05.650> and<00:01:06.010> you<00:01:06.850> can<00:01:06.970> see

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
awful lot of numbers and you can see

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.930
