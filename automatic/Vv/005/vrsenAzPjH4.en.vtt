00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.590
 1.3 and 1.5 kW meat grinder - as far as 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.710
 big difference? 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.840
 And is it worth overpaying for the Braun brand, when many 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.549
 analogues are cheaper? 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:12.590
 Let's see. 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.910
 By the way, Fotos online store has prepared a small 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.680
 contest with useful gifts. 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.740
 On the conditions will tell at the end of the video. 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.910
 Compact, reliable and powerful - Braun Triumph meat grinders 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.929
 Multiquick can grind meat, fish, crackers, vegetables 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.290
 in just a few seconds, and it saves time and effort. 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.360
 Before us are four models - G 1300, G 1500 in black and white 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 color option, as well as G 3000. 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.050
 The design of the grinders is almost the same. 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.990
 Only the G 3000 has a slightly wider body. 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.380
 The main parts and cutting parts are made of metal, 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.680
 which guarantees reliability and hygiene. 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.580
 And the screw connecting element is made of special 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.890
 wear resistant plastic. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.689
 The meat grinder steadily stands on the surface and will not 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.420
 To slide, the rubberized legs are responsible for it. 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.030
 The device is fairly easy to assemble and disassemble. 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.909
 For G 3000, this process is facilitated by a special button; 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.520
 for the rest of the models, everything is done manually, but also 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 difficulties. 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 Included are 3 metal discs with different holes 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 diameter - you can cook a variety of minced meat. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.249
 Meat grinders G 1500 and G 3000 are additionally equipped with a nozzle “Kubbe” 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.380
 for cooking hollow sausages, tubes, and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 traditional nozzle for the formation of sausages. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.420
 The main difference between the models from each other is 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 in power. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 With the G 1300 it is 1.3 kilowatts, while with the G 1500 and G 3000 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.810
 1.5 kilowatts. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.261
 Accordingly, this difference affects 

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.749
 price 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.560
 At first glance, 1.3 and 1.5 kW - a slight difference, 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.299
 so why pay more? 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.770
 But in fact, the difference was palpable. 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.429
 For the test, we took a disk with an average diameter of holes 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.690
 and two types of meat - soft chicken fillet and wiry 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
 pork shoulder to cook a combined minced meat. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 G 1300 began work optimistically, but quickly enough veins 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.340
 and fat complicated the process. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.590
 To push the meat, I had to put 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.590
 force 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.640
 And after a while, the meat grinder gave up altogether, 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.010
 it was necessary to unwind and clean it. 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.090
 But for the processing of poultry or fish, the device is suitable 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.950
 Ideal - products will twist quickly and easily. 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.959
 At the same time, the G 3000 coped with the meat by 5 plus. 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.209
 We didn't even have to push the pieces. 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.540
 Therefore, if you are going to regularly twist 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.049
 meat of different types in large quantities, then G 3000 or 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.750
 The G 1500 will do better. 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.340
 Separately tell about the model G 3000. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.239
 Unlike other meat grinders, it has a function 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 reverse. 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.890
 If the work of the meat grinder is difficult, turn off the device and press 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.890
 reverse. 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.709
 Thus, it is possible to recycle the toughest pieces or 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.861
 even frozen meat, about it, by the way, it is written 

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:09.530
 on the device case. 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.579
 G 3000 also has a longer network cable, which does not limit 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.469
 us in choosing a place for the device. 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.301
 All grinders can be neatly folded to 

00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:19.530
 he did not interfere. 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.750
 Let's sum up. 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.280
 We boldly note the high-quality Slovak assembly - all the details 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.280
 tight to each other, do not hang out, do not 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.640
 unscrew during operation - this is the main advantage 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.640
 Braun. 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.709
 Using the devices is very simple. 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.530
 Products are twisted quickly. 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.989
 As a drawback, let's call the presence of only one speed, 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.709
 but for standard tasks this is quite enough. 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.849
 And now about the competition. 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.769
 Find in which review of the grinders we told 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.349
 about the plastic key to replace the nozzles? 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.940
 The first, correctly answered, will receive a set as a gift 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.790
 kitchen knives calve. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.219
 The answer to the question leave in the comments to the video. 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:59.739
 on the official Youtube channel of the Fotos store.
