00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello live evrideyidro 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.170
 and today we have a review of the sketchbook for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.849
 April 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.219
 it's all the same tight canson paper for 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 mixed techniques and basically i'm drawing in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.310
 this sketchbook with your farm brush 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.650
 pontoon is such a tank with mascara and on 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.560
 end he has a plastic tassel in this 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.539
 month I began to do small 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.580
 dynamic sketches of figures to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.500
 bother much on anatomy a 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 focus more on 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 the movement spoke for itself and through 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.140
 movement show some emotion plus 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 every day I began to try 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 draw some small picture 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
 mascara is nothing especially outsiders 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.280
 people do not say a turn and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.730
 from our trip berlin but let them be 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.870
 also apparently i keep mine 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 composite sketches though it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.739
 still rather difficult but 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 it seems I have become less understood 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.600
 how to do this if we discuss come up 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 hands my friends PWM is happening here 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 such things for daily sketches 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.970
 I usually use mascara either on fire and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 dynamic formula and then putting it on 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.450
 clothes from some street fashion 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.900
 blog or immediately draw everything from the magazine 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.490
 I began to spend more time exactly 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.479
 the movement of expressiveness of figures than 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.479
 to some detail 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350
 this 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.950
 here 's a little tip from the animator in 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.140
 As reefs use pictures from by 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.969
 walkie talkies because there is often depicted 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 same person in several 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.770
 different angles and movements so it is very 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.220
 convenient to study as a figure 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.020
 move well but what happens if 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.509
 a picture I do not like it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.689
 sent to such a virtual 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.659
 I realized that I was desperately lacking 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:08.080
 light and tried to use gouache 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.420
 For my pictures, in principle, the effect is to me 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.599
 I liked it but I still have difficulty 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.390
 I understand how gouache works sometimes if 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.970
 the picture does not work then I take the scissors 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.940
 need paper and start all the rules here 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.940
 so and here is gouache from of course well 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.849
 by the way the white line on my showers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.730
 The drawings are not white pencil but just 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.189
 I leave unpainted pieces of paper 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.609
 because I'm probably neurotic but me 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.840
 like the main thing to like 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.639
 some sketches began to do immediately 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.599
 pencil so that you can be on 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.599
 top paint 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.330
 about this picture I more 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.040
 told the video about the last battle 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.040
 so if you are interested take a look 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.430
 how about this one 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.620
 continued sketching the dynamics now 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.830
 This is for me in the most fascinating pictures 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.069
 just tried to use bright 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.620
 colored mascara for the shadows but I think she 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.450
 too direct intense yet not comfortable 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.700
 because it is eroded by water and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.700
 smears the bottom black layer 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.280
 I tried to do inverse drawings 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.120
 not black on white 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.030
 but on the contrary I liked it very well and 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.889
 this month April is over 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.919
 be sure to check out the sketchbook review 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.900
 a year ago to see which 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.870
 Progress has happened to me this year. 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.450
 she today is all put huskies 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.350
 comment subscribe to the channel 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.940
 I have public contact on Facebook 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.660
 instagram where daily phrases into one 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.830
 pictures of the video come out every week 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.830
 but all good and inspiration
