00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.570
 in StarCraft 2 had as a helper injustice and must be the Ski Hofer guy 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.240
 By the way, the aging space has cowboy and his buddy day as pretty 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.349
 Findley 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.769
 to optimize edged Möhringen with pears are displeasure 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.910
 and here you can already see how class StarCraft 2 tells its story 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.590
 namely with such cutscene Aufgebot the game graphics 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.269
 In addition, there are sometimes slides 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.869
 but usually it is worked 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.480
 Green is chatting on his flagship empire with the Master 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 Warriors Fort Steering Coastal Majority 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.430
 These lead staging sought strategy change of their kind for it 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.500
 high praise announced 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.940
 it is a disaster 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 SID 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.310
 less in the narrative missions 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.400
 spectacular 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.650
 here there are usually only sayings with superimposed character pictures 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.700
 trier 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 May on this calculator just always finds the right words 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.940
 us star Pharell is attacked 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.700
 but back to their return 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.299
 PREGAS Raumkreuzer also serves as an atmospheric main menu for the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.040
 Campaign on the bridge wavy the next mission the plot 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.799
 Although not so many uses are optional right 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.299
 Below, each unlock which new uniform with the order 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.760
 can bring settled bets to King Georg Fiedler, for example 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.750
 also money with which I hire in the ship-Baden Merian mercenaries 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.420
 These texts Rostock military units, however, are only 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.399
 really useful on the higher levels of difficulty 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.290
 In addition, I can in the bar 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.170
 as in any room of return, chat with your coaches 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.470
 she is said to be not very close to Chelsea 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.550
 the moment all the time inside, playing with the damned ones 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.970
 Oppenwehe there 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.480
 the bike tour i need someone the just chosen idiom and 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.320
 good manners the culprit does not mature properly 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.100
 I have nothing against people having this plan before the 10 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.679
 he is completely dr such diallo 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.859
 but also in the heroes experience 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:21.049
 My darling here, however, is the slot machine supposedly supposed to be from Dubai 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.489
 may gamble 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.280
 this has nothing to do with the Blizzard classic except the name 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.170
 are you going to do my child 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.109
 while arcade shooter and at the same time a proof of this 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.790
 even with the foot grasp the level editor of StarCraft 2 even 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.779
 such packages offshoot but what to let but now continue with our tour 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.140
 through the periods 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 in the arsenal can not buy type 2 diabetes for each units Thalberg 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.129
 also redeem with missions 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.769
 which, for example, I take my heavy cruisers with the missile special attacks 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.080
 give a flyer 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.389
 as with the men the shield off 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.579
 Last but not least, Werder still has the lab 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.139
 if I meet in the goal and life goals velvety research group of 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.369
 Variety dwarf or per suit 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:03.510
 With that technology seems free 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.459
 however, only one of two alternatives 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.329
 Here, for example, I have the choice between the walls flier and who from the 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.220
 Predecessor known research ship 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.359
 after four victories 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.359
 To see old friends again makes fun 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.269
 especially the April buy the research increase the variety of the campaign 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:21.930
 clear 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.710
 because it unlocks new tactical possibilities 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.210
 with the research ship, others like the animals react to 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.300
 Example of this meadow tour with the Tigris just the Tatar base one 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.239
 City and they are still a few old known 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.530
 the women less 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.810
 The Blizzard has also incorporated units into the campaign 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.640
 Multiplayer mode no longer exists 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 the previous day as by the way not taxes instead I have those the bitches 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.949
 Escort day with no western troops 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.580
 this mission here is the exact opposite 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.709
 I steer the hero similar to Porsch 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.799
 which is supported by computer-controlled soldiers 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.460
 although he actually would not need the help of the MRG killer 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.460
 he can also throw nuclear bombs 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.159
 Incidentally, before this order, I was allowed to decide if I would like Trau Schroeder Nuova 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.199
 support 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.399
 the ghost agents may know them as heroes of the frozen one 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:15.849
 Consumption and Lizards plays StarCraft Ghost 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.469
 depending on the choice for the niece other reward also denies for 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.729
 other missions just with nova instead of doing research 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.169
 that's a nice idea 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.009
 just a pity that these times election occurs in the campaign only three times 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.680
 Speaking of nice idea Blizzard has something for almost every use 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.410
 to come up with something original 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.879
 about this card about rolls a deadly of Erbach heat 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.020
 To escape him must fall in love with a base again and again 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.990
 by letting the intended take off move 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.840
 that sounds easy, but at the same time I should also deep red Voß off 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.479
 the way spaces that have nestled here 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.349
 and of course there is even time in this mission 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.159
 from her queen Kerrigan 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:59.320
 the WLE research results from data centers women 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.650
 So I have to check the building windows before they reach them 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.529
 anyway, they test us like that 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.539
 however, not all bets are really original 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:09.759
 but above all, start 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.889
 here for example, it is Kurdish refugee controlling 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.219
 and here I keep my base hacked against hordes 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.219
 on higher levels of difficulty that both of course right 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:22.749
 but you know already from other games 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.759
 some missions also focus on just one type of unit in 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:32.050
 This mission gives it energy fields the Main bridges continuously 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.300
 Life energy sucking off the teeth Cruisers consider the subject growing 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
 That's why they are responsible for the offensive 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.470
 Of course, the later mission also takes part in big battles 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.639
 Mainwiesen polyphonic Irma Wait says our crashed spaceship 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.629
 break through 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.949
 The special consignors of the units are also involved 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.150
 Example the siege ring mode the siege state Sa 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.660
 the match will be the attack of the board 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660
 and we have Artur commune of heavy cruisers 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.660
 The most exciting, however, are the four separate mission the campaign 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.970
 profiled in the right direction 5 m square feature along with his photos 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.779
 dark world 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.319
 to come to grips 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.550
 what it is not contracted by Zander 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.860
 Betrayal photos and says 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.280
 alone in Münster force
