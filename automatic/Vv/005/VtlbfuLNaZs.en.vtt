carbon fiber looking - no keys on me at

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
carbon fiber looking - no keys on me at
the<00:01:11.729> moment<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> turn<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:15.049> they

higher-quality materials so again

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
higher-quality materials so again
there's<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> carbon<00:01:29.040> fiber<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> see

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there's the carbon fiber if you can see

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.219 
there's the carbon fiber if you can see
it's<00:01:30.840> also<00:01:30.960> got<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> chrome<00:01:32.810> there<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:34.020> been

really don't like the chrome actually
for<00:01:38.700> me<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.720> looks<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.229> nice<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.799> does

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
for me it looks really nice it does

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.870 
for me it looks really nice it does
dress<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> bit

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
dress it up a bit

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.620

softer<00:01:42.810> touch<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> dash<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> leather

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
softer touch on the dash on the leather

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.150 
softer touch on the dash on the leather
same<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> sides

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.160

difference<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.470> this<00:02:05.680> little<00:02:05.920> cubby<00:02:06.250> hole

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
difference is this little cubby hole

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.750 
difference is this little cubby hole
that<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.700> have<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.380> 2012<00:02:09.220> bid<00:02:09.460> in<00:02:09.550> half
