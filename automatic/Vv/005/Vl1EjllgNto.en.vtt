00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 what exactly is the buttermilk and what 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.119
 it contains the viscous easily 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.610
 sour-tasting milk is one 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.150
 by-product in feed production 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.710
 by-product does not necessarily mean 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.300
 that it is a bad product or 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.130
 but he has bad qualities in 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 on the contrary buttermilk even extreme 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.750
 healthy than 100 grams of butter milk 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.040
 Contain around 35 to 40 calories that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.360
 is very little and accordingly 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.879
 is the mother really suitable for me 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.680
 very good at a diet 100 grams 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.180
 also contain four grams of protein and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 up to 4 grams of carbohydrates 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.000
 These are values ​​you can work with 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.870
 really very good with the athletes 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.159
 can work 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.019
 In addition, it is natural 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.150
 not according to the values ​​of a protein shake or 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.979
 similar to dietary fiber are 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.080
 none contained in the mother's milk for it 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.269
 but firmly and in very little 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.240
 quantities of 100 grams butter milk included 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.030
 namely the 0 56 grams of fat that is 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.900
 usually less than 1 percent 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.070
 accordingly, the whole 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.780
 Buttermilk manufacturer with this 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.070
 Advertising message and this everyone could

 Believe in giving breast milk 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 really maximum around the one percent fat 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.560
 minerals and vitamins are 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.510
 of course also in the mother's milk 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.150
 contain ingredients are mentioned 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.310
 calcium potassium phosphate zinc iron and 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.479
 Magnesium especially calcium is in very 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.079
 very high amounts in the mother's milk 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.430
 contain 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.189
 if you have half a liter of buttermilk 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.880
 you drink already 70 euro daily requirement 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.850
 calcium 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 vitamins are the vitamin b2 b5 and 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.579
 b12 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.039
 besides, in the mother's milk too 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.170
 important bacteria contain you 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.270
 the positive impact on ours 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.890
 intestinal flora have accordingly in gut 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.469
 it may help more often 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.369
 smartphone butter is not the same 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.009
 videos now buttermilk at 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.479
 lose weight or build muscle 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.640
 the buttermilk is a great one 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.249
 alternative versus classic loose 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.810
 in shakes or fitness shakes why 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.420
 Is not that already mentioned 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.249
 is a relatively high protein content 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.069
 half liter buttermilk has around the 17th 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:11.110
 up to 18 grams of protein this is now 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.700
 not as high as she has in shake 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 but it is a good value 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.760
 Accordingly, you can value with these 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.260
 work and especially through the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.819
 want to operate muscle and not 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.319
 be sure to grab a protein shake 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.450
 We definitely want to be able to 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.530
 do not grab butter 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 the basis are also addressed in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.870
 the mother's milk contained and the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.909
 supply in our body with energy 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.080
 the location remained battered again 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.450
 on and the talks is there 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.000
 buttermilk also a super super source 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.319
 for and because of their low calories 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.540
 number of yes really 35 calories to 100 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.340
 They really appreciate that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.530
 great sports drink what to lose weight 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.090
 Can we help because we have the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.650
 Hunger not progressing as quickly 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.849
 drives the conversations can us 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 butter not really very good 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.360
 How can you not help the butter 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.680
 refining the taste is not 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.720
 Everyone's taste is easy 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.220
 What you can do is sour 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.739
 For example, the buttermilk with 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 classic protein powder nixon and has 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.440
 so one of the improved protein shakes 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.390
 I say 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.129
 but not only that one can also do that 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.790
 Buttermilk, for example, with a flight 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.019
 puree and also has such a great 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.819
 Mother does not like how I want it now 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.739
 almost say one while losing weight 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.980
 can help or the muscle building 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.540
 Mother milk is already supported 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.680
 a sore drink though the only one 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.629
 by-product in feed production 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.060
 she has many positive ones 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.370
 features on our cars on 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.750
 our muscles and and and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.760
 Accordingly, I can be the mother myself 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.500
 Of course, pretty much everyone recommends it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.639
 its taste tastes slightly sour 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.560
 but i can only recommend it 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.139
 I often access buttermilk 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.669
 try it every two or four days 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.799
 not to drink half a liter of water 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:45.049
 Accordingly, I can only recommend 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.030
 Another tip if you buy bitterly 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.139
 grabs the pure buttermilk for that 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.109
 is not my mother 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.090
 is buttermilk without this pure additive 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.430
 usually more is usually still on 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.989
 10 percent water or else ten to 15 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.549
 not even then so if the 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.379
 butter does not buy then the pure 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.730
 buttermilk is otherwise suitable 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.440
 butter with really good too 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.819
 to bake 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.840
 This could be a really good baking back 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.099
 addition or as a milk substitute for 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.870
 I can only shake protein 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.669
 recommend vanilla powder and butter 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.190
 milk tastes really good and you 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.320
 In addition, protein shake was something 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.000
 revalue by the high protein content 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.849
 Of course you can also do it yourself 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.370
 make more butter milk easy for 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.590
 Apple banana or another 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.699
 So do not mix fruit with the butter 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 Nothing results then you really have 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.720
 a super smith and he is extreme 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.630
 of course, which I can not recommend 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.340
 is in ready- mixed flight under milk 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.510
 to buy mix because it usually takes 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.420
 a lot of sugar in 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.650
 So keep it there since you mix it yourself 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.060
 I want to know how you know 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.710
 tastes in the mother's milk opposite 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.090
 she tastes you so you me 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.500
 more she personally tastes that think 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.940
 I have to have you now you have 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.370
 Somehow different milk drink what we

 g4 iran likes to drink it all there 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.220
 There seems to be comments 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.440

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.180
