00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
gun carrier a little difficult at first

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.940 
gun carrier a little difficult at first
but<00:02:03.549> you<00:02:03.670> get<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:05.380> figure<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.860> out

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
but you get to you figure it out

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.850 
but you get to you figure it out
eventually<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:10.149> four<00:02:10.450> guns<00:02:10.720> just<00:02:11.650> fit

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
eventually and your four guns just fit

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.040 
eventually and your four guns just fit
in<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.670> now<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.690> seems<00:02:16.930> too

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
in like that now you can if it seems too

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.910 
in like that now you can if it seems too
bulky<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.660> make<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> thinner<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:25.920> by

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
bulky you can make it thinner just by

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.150 
bulky you can make it thinner just by
removing<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.410> two<00:02:29.410> by<00:02:29.590> four<00:02:29.860> blocks

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
removing one of the two by four blocks

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.930 
removing one of the two by four blocks
ins<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.790> how<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.030> make<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.750> lego

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
ins and that is how you make a lego

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.110 
ins and that is how you make a lego
gun-carrying<00:02:36.940> droid<00:02:37.829> fits<00:02:38.829> four<00:02:39.099> guns<00:02:39.340> can

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
gun-carrying droid fits four guns can

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.720 
gun-carrying droid fits four guns can
move<00:02:40.269> around<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.840> wheels<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:42.190> that's
