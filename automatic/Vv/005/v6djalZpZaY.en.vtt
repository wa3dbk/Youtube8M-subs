00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
and once you get it down to a certain

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.100 
and once you get it down to a certain
level<00:00:36.910> then<00:00:37.030> you<00:00:37.149> guys<00:00:37.300> like<00:00:37.540> every<00:00:37.899> now<00:00:37.989> and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
level then you guys like every now and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.540 
level then you guys like every now and
then<00:00:38.170> I<00:00:38.260> keep<00:00:38.500> like<00:00:38.680> trying<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.010> say<00:00:39.160> Batman

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
then I keep like trying to say Batman

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.150 
then I keep like trying to say Batman
first<00:00:39.930> until<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:40.960> get<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.200> down<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.590> local

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
first until I get it down to the local

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.920 
first until I get it down to the local
that<00:00:42.399> need<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.790> be<00:00:42.820> then<00:00:43.360> once<00:00:43.540> I<00:00:43.630> get<00:00:43.750> down<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
that need to be then once I get down to

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.320 
that need to be then once I get down to
the<00:00:44.080> level<00:00:44.380> that<00:00:44.560> I<00:00:44.770> needed<00:00:44.980> to<00:00:45.130> be<00:00:45.330> then

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
the level that I needed to be then

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.360 
the level that I needed to be then
obviously<00:00:46.480> it's<00:00:46.900> just<00:00:47.140> ignoring<00:00:47.650> exactly

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
obviously it's just ignoring exactly

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.370 
obviously it's just ignoring exactly
when<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.700> breathe<00:00:49.660> in<00:00:49.900> and<00:00:50.020> breathe<00:00:50.200> out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
when to breathe in and breathe out

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.819 
when to breathe in and breathe out
because<00:00:51.510> he<00:00:52.510> doesn't<00:00:52.960> talk<00:00:53.320> when<00:00:53.530> he<00:00:53.590> breathes

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
because he doesn't talk when he breathes

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.670 
because he doesn't talk when he breathes
any<00:00:54.040> talks<00:00:54.280> when<00:00:54.460> he<00:00:54.520> brace<00:00:54.730> out<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.680> that's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
any talks when he brace out so that's

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.020 
any talks when he brace out so that's
how<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:56.890> kind<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.220> get<00:00:57.370> part<00:00:57.579> of<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.700> voice

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
how you kind of get part of that voice

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.830 
how you kind of get part of that voice
is<00:00:58.420> from<00:00:58.870> breathing<00:00:59.770> out<00:00:59.920> heavily<00:01:00.400> and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
is from breathing out heavily and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.320 
is from breathing out heavily and
but<00:01:03.380> before<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.830> can<00:01:03.920> do<00:01:04.130> that<00:01:04.160> you<00:01:04.880> have<00:01:04.910> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
but before you can do that you have to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.000 
but before you can do that you have to
learn<00:01:05.660> kind<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.050> how<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.230> moderate<00:01:06.830> your

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
learn kind of how to moderate your

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.230 
learn kind of how to moderate your
breath<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.670> sounds<00:01:08.000> like<00:01:08.120> you're

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
breath so it sounds like you're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.700 
breath so it sounds like you're
breathing<00:01:08.390> out<00:01:08.660> a<00:01:08.690> whole<00:01:08.870> lot<00:01:09.050> but<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:09.350> can<00:01:09.380> do

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
breathing out a whole lot but you can do

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.280 
breathing out a whole lot but you can do
long<00:01:09.950> phrases<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.670> sentences<00:01:10.900> now<00:01:11.900> I'm<00:01:12.050> still

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
long phrases and sentences now I'm still

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.990 
long phrases and sentences now I'm still
working<00:01:12.620> on<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.010> I've<00:01:13.310> been<00:01:13.340> trying<00:01:13.940> to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
working on that and I've been trying to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.910 
working on that and I've been trying to
get<00:01:14.180> my<00:01:14.270> Batman<00:01:14.660> voice<00:01:14.870> for<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> couple<00:01:15.860> of

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
get my Batman voice for a couple of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.550 
get my Batman voice for a couple of
months<00:01:16.040> now<00:01:16.780> ever<00:01:17.780> since<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.050> watched<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.380> deal

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
months now ever since I watched the deal

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.650 
months now ever since I watched the deal
I<00:01:18.860> think<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.280> was<00:01:19.370> backing<00:01:19.820> I<00:01:20.030> did<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.480> for<00:01:20.630> a

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
I think it was backing I did it for a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.270 
I think it was backing I did it for a
while<00:01:20.870> but<00:01:21.230> then<00:01:21.410> I<00:01:21.470> really<00:01:21.770> started<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.100> do<00:01:22.160> it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
while but then I really started to do it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.539 
while but then I really started to do it
back<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.730> June<00:01:23.680> so

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.200 

that's<00:01:28.060> really<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.450> magic<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:30.210> like

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
that's really the magic to it and like

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
that's really the magic to it and like
what<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> now<00:01:31.750> get<00:01:31.990> now<00:01:32.229> your<00:01:32.409> I'll<00:01:32.530> try

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.279 

so<00:01:41.770> basically<00:01:42.130> what<00:01:42.880> I'm<00:01:43.000> trying<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.329> do<00:01:43.509> just

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
so basically what I'm trying to do just

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.219 
so basically what I'm trying to do just
get<00:01:44.409> down<00:01:44.619> at<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.890> level<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:46.539> after<00:01:47.020> that

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
get down at this level and after that

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.639 
get down at this level and after that
you<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.100> have<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.399> learn<00:01:48.670> how<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.360> deal<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.990> dog

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
you just have to learn how to deal a dog

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.279 
you just have to learn how to deal a dog
deep<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:52.000> breathe<00:01:52.720> out<00:01:52.899> heavily<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.700> fu

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
deep and breathe out heavily so here fu

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.450 
deep and breathe out heavily so here fu
mmm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
mmm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.020 
mmm
I'm<00:01:57.460> here<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:59.530> do<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.679> want

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.419 

where<00:02:05.030> are<00:02:05.270> they

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and you just basically go down at that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.119 
and you just basically go down at that
level<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:13.239> what<00:02:13.870> would<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.230> ghost<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.830> like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
practice it I can even do it that long

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 
practice it I can even do it that long
