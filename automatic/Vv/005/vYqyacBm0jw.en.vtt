00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
 the monkey guy these distributors 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.540
 have to talk to them and explain how 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.490
 the event that is in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
 this active moment in the game for the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.629
 that they do not know this from today until 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
 the next two weeks we will have a 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.440
 adventure in destiny that is called anger 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 of the queen where as you see here once 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.290
 that we entered the game because 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.390
 will warn let's say that as you see with the 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.310
 announcement of the day what we have to do 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.620
 to start let's say take it out 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.850
 advantage this event is to go to the tower and 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.190
 we'll see that the guy who gives us the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.720
 contracts will have a series of six 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.279
 new contracts with the stamp of the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.839
 queen so basically what 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.730
 we will have to do is complete these 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.559
 contracts and like contracts 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.620
 vanguard and crucible this will give us 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.519
 reputation of the queen faction with 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.050
 this reputation we can increase 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.030
 our range that will allow us 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.859
 buy it to the emissary of the queen pieces 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 rare and legendary the emissary 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.170
 found in the back of the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.940
 tower an area that was not there before 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 available right behind the guy that we 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.429
 give the contracts we will see that a door 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.800
 will be open and then at the end of that 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.329
 hallway we can find the emissary 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.819
 externally by the time three weapons 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.699
 rare is this a class mark that in my 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.559
 case is a legendary layer two emblems 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.200
 and also two shaders 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 or camouflages for your armor and all 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.829
 these come with the design the logo and the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 exclusive colors of the queen the 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.710
 advantage of making these contracts is that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960
 if we manage to reach the rank that we 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.299
 demands to buy a layer or the shader 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 or weapons because we will not need to spend 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.179
 marks or signs of crucible or of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.890
 vanguard to buy them if not not 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.229
 it sells us in exchange for the mere volume the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.970
 money in testing besides that be 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.649
 every time we complete one of these 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 block contracts we will do a mission 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.380
 on epic difficulty these missions are 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 of level 24 and we will have one available 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.110
 it will be a random mission that already 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 we have in the game but increased as 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.679
 let's say with the ethical modifier that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.539
 will make the amounts more difficult and 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.770
 have basically enough shields the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.409
 great the vast majority of enemies 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.360
 they will also come with a modifier 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.580
 element damage which will mean that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.170
 the element that if for example the 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.250
 Modifiers of solar elements 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.020
 all the solar damage that there is to the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.520
 enemies and that you do towards them with 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.069
 a weapon that has this element can 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 be increased so the best advice 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.149
 what can I do with these missions is that 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.530
 use special and heavy weapons 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.360
 who have the elemental damage know that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.009
 the primaries do not have elemental damage and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.619
 also use classes and can by 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.020
 example in my case the gunman east of 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.910
 hunter the consell 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.350
 it has sun damage and a mission 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.730
 special sun damage so use my 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.170
 super gives me many advantages against 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.640
 voices then basically what 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.230
 we have to do is commit these 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.970
 missions and upon completion we will have the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.580
 opportunity to receive a piece 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 legendary of the inclusive design of the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.570
 queen that will be let's say that this color 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.860
 purple in its great majority equal the 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.410
 we can change with the shaders of 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.210
 camouflage if we wish it and then this 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.380
 legendary piece is pretty good is to 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.420
 same level as any other that does not 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.130
 it looks good in the game and it's technically 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.900
 easier to get the the piece that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.310
 we receive is going to be random and we can 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.620
 receive one for each these missions 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.210
 that we complete we can not receive the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.800
 reward of the mission if we do not have a 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 contract completed if a friend us 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.650
 invites his mission through his 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.600
 contract, we can help you 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 but if we will not have 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.200
 that an active mission for having fulfilled 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.700
 a contract can help you make your 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.920
 mission we will not receive any reward 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.540
 at this time as there are six contracts 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.400
 in today we can do up 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.630
 six missions of today and tomorrow 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.340
 suppose it is with more contracts 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.480
 we can do six other missions and this 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.950
 it really is quite good for you 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.230
 advanced players who want to say 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.510
 get legendary weapons technically 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.800
 easy, this is very helpful 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.660
 now the missions then I must say that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 they are easy they are really a bit 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.840
 complicated do not have a good 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.160
 guy and they do not have elements in their weapons 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.070
 that you are required for this mission is 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.330
 pressing if they can complete the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.920
 they will be received legendary pieces 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.020
 that they may come from a lot 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.550
 help arrive the boys these are the 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.900
 mission of the queen this is an event 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.330
 as the day that will last will last two weeks 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.610
 from today September 23 to 6 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.290
 October and then I think this will be a 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.420
 event that will return more and more in the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.980
 future that possibly more elaborate 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.390
 with more things to do in the next 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 time it comes but for now this what 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.090
 we have hope this is clear 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.320
 any doubts if you still have 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.330
 some other question do not forget to leave in 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.770
 the comments and nothing this is another 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.570
 story that you liked a single 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.570
 tone if you do not feel until the next
