00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
population was 1955 at that point we

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.760 
population was 1955 at that point we
were<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.609> under<00:00:05.970> 2<00:00:06.210> million<00:00:06.420> people<00:00:06.770> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
were just under 2 million people the

were just under 2 million people the
last<00:00:07.950> sentence<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.519> 2010<00:00:09.330> put<00:00:09.990> us<00:00:10.110> right

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
last sentence in 2010 put us right

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.839 
last sentence in 2010 put us right
around<00:00:10.710> seven<00:00:11.190> hundred<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.460> fifteen

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
around seven hundred and fifteen

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520 
around seven hundred and fifteen
thousand<00:00:12.330> people<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.809> that's<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.080> decrease<00:00:13.500> of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
thousand people so that's a decrease of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.320 
thousand people so that's a decrease of
about<00:00:13.710> sixty<00:00:14.160> percent<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.490> population<00:00:14.610> about

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
about sixty percent of population about

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.570 
about sixty percent of population about
six<00:00:15.599> years<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:16.890> many<00:00:17.039> factors<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
six years so there's many factors that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.060 
six years so there's many factors that
led<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.570> lot<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.410> are<00:00:19.500> systemic

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
led to that a lot of them are systemic

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.439 
led to that a lot of them are systemic
and<00:00:20.220> started<00:00:20.550> way<00:00:20.670> before<00:00:20.730> any<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and started way before any of this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.720 
and started way before any of this
happened<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> there's<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.130> law<00:00:23.400> called<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
happened so there's one law called the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
happened so there's one law called the
Home<00:00:23.939> Rule<00:00:24.119> Act<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> nineteen<00:00:24.869> oh<00:00:24.960> nine<00:00:25.369> that's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
Home Rule Act of nineteen oh nine that's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
Home Rule Act of nineteen oh nine that's
a<00:00:26.550> statewide<00:00:26.820> law<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.720> effectively<00:00:28.140> makes

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
a statewide law which effectively makes

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.900 
a statewide law which effectively makes
it<00:00:28.560> impossible<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.310> city<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it impossible for one city to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.359 
it impossible for one city to
incorporate<00:00:30.630> another<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:31.980> instance<00:00:32.040> as

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
incorporate another so for instance as

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
incorporate another so for instance as
new<00:00:32.520> york<00:00:32.669> city<00:00:32.880> grew<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.180> chicago<00:00:34.079> grew

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
new york city grew and chicago grew

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.020 
new york city grew and chicago grew
there<00:00:34.559> ever<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.980> able<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> incorporate<00:00:35.670> some

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there ever to able to incorporate some

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.459 
there ever to able to incorporate some
of<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.180> smaller<00:00:36.300> towns<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.110> detroit

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
of these smaller towns which detroit

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
of these smaller towns which detroit
just<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.280> able<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
just was not able to do so if you

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
just was not able to do so if you
actually<00:00:39.270> look<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> map<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.050> detroit<00:00:40.350> you'll

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually look at a map of detroit you'll

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
actually look at a map of detroit you'll
see<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.160> there's<00:00:41.370> two<00:00:41.550> cities<00:00:41.879> inside<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
see that there's two cities inside of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
see that there's two cities inside of
the<00:00:42.899> city<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> Detroit<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.590> hmmm<00:00:44.190> traffic

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the city of Detroit there's hmmm traffic

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
the city of Detroit there's hmmm traffic
and<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:44.789> also<00:00:44.910> Highland<00:00:45.420> Park<00:00:45.690> also<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and then also Highland Park also as the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.350 
and then also Highland Park also as the
city<00:00:46.980> grew<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.700> was<00:00:47.910> not<00:00:48.030> able<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
city grew out it was not able to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.869 
city grew out it was not able to
incorporate<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> suburbs<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
incorporate some of the suburbs that

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.100 
incorporate some of the suburbs that
we're<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> area<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> led<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> very

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
we're in the area so this led to a very

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.549 
we're in the area so this led to a very
fragmented<00:00:53.270> metropolitan<00:00:54.270> area<00:00:54.559> Detroit

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
fragmented metropolitan area Detroit

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
fragmented metropolitan area Detroit
Metro<00:00:56.039> Detroit<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> made<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.539> 130

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
Metro Detroit now is made up of over 130

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
Metro Detroit now is made up of over 130
municipalities<00:00:59.160> over<00:00:59.670> half<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.239> are

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
municipalities over half of which are

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.439 
municipalities over half of which are
five<00:01:00.660> square<00:01:00.960> miles<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.530> smaller<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
five square miles or smaller and so that

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.750 
five square miles or smaller and so that
leads<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.170> waste<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.979> resources<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
leads to a lot of waste of resources in

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
leads to a lot of waste of resources in
my<00:01:05.850> opinion<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.619> over

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
my opinion because you have that's over

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.630 
my opinion because you have that's over
130<00:01:08.490> mayors<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> City<00:01:09.299> Council's<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.640> fire

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
130 mayors and City Council's and fire

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
130 mayors and City Council's and fire
and<00:01:12.000> police<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.020> school<00:01:13.260> boards<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.650> things

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and police and school boards and things

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
and police and school boards and things
like<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.299> could<00:01:15.479> have

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
like that where if they could have

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
like that where if they could have
aggregate<00:01:16.140> some<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.380> those<00:01:16.439> resources<00:01:16.650> things

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
aggregate some of those resources things

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
aggregate some of those resources things
might<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.460> done<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.090> efficiently<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
might be done a lot more efficiently it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.999 
might be done a lot more efficiently it
also<00:01:19.380> led<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.060> Metro<00:01:21.060> Detroit<00:01:21.270> becoming<00:01:21.720> very

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
also led to Metro Detroit becoming very

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
also led to Metro Detroit becoming very
segregated<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.490> terms<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.790> racial<00:01:24.150> racial

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
segregated in terms of racial racial

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.230 
segregated in terms of racial racial
lines<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> look<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> city<00:01:26.850> like

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
lines so if you look at a city like

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
lines so if you look at a city like
lavonia<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.960> instance<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
lavonia for instance which is not a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.719 
lavonia for instance which is not a
small<00:01:28.860> town<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> stretch<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
small town by you stretch the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
small town by you stretch the
imagination<00:01:30.119> there's<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.860> around<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
imagination there's right around a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.280 
imagination there's right around a
hundred<00:01:32.220> thousand<00:01:32.670> people<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
hundred thousand people but it's

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.929 
hundred thousand people but it's
ninety-five<00:01:34.290> percent<00:01:34.500> white<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.490> compared<00:01:35.850> to

ninety-five percent white as compared to

ninety-five percent white as compared to
a<00:01:36.090> city<00:01:36.390> like<00:01:36.509> Detroit<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.770> seven

a city like Detroit which is seven

percent<00:01:41.220> black<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> yeah<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.540> factors

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
percent black so yeah so all the factors

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.999 
percent black so yeah so all the factors
led<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> depopulation<00:01:48.049> including<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
led to the depopulation including the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.139 
led to the depopulation including the
great<00:01:51.680> greatly<00:01:52.680> efficient<00:01:53.220> freeway<00:01:53.970> system

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
great greatly efficient freeway system

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
great greatly efficient freeway system
that<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.770> allowed<00:01:56.040> people

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that we have here which allowed people

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.340 
that we have here which allowed people
to<00:01:56.399> even<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.000> their<00:01:57.149> jobs<00:01:57.479> were<00:01:57.659> downtown<00:01:58.079> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
amount of time and so eventually as the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.899 
amount of time and so eventually as the
people<00:02:04.560> lived<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> jobs<00:02:05.460> moved

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
people lived out there the jobs moved

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
people lived out there the jobs moved
out<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.390> them<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.409> led

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
out there with them and then that led

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.949 
out there with them and then that led
just<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.890> more<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.340> depopulation<00:02:09.030> also

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
just a more and more depopulation also

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.130 
just a more and more depopulation also

but also those loans could not be used

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.600 
but also those loans could not be used
in<00:02:24.930> integrated<00:02:25.440> neighborhoods<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.430> as

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
in integrated neighborhoods so as

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
in integrated neighborhoods so as
Detroit<00:02:27.420> became<00:02:27.720> more<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.080> more<00:02:28.140> integrated

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
Detroit became more and more integrated

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.940 
Detroit became more and more integrated
there<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.160> almost<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:30.050> financial<00:02:31.050> incentive

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
there was almost a financial incentive

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.270 
there was almost a financial incentive
towards<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> white<00:02:33.209> soldiers<00:02:33.450> or<00:02:33.959> white

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
towards the white soldiers or white

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.380 
towards the white soldiers or white
people<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.340> Detroit<00:02:35.490> moving<00:02:35.970> out<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
people of Detroit moving out to the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 
people of Detroit moving out to the
suburbs<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.709> these<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> lot<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
suburbs so all of these with a lot of

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.010 
suburbs so all of these with a lot of
other<00:02:38.760> factors<00:02:39.000> led<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.600> population

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
other factors led to the population

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.040 
other factors led to the population
depopulation<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.190> have<00:02:41.370> today<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.780> all

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
depopulation that we have today so all

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.500 
depopulation that we have today so all
in<00:02:43.350> all<00:02:43.440> Detroit<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.280> now<00:02:44.430> left<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:44.790> about<00:02:45.030> 20

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
in all Detroit is now left with about 20

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.810 
in all Detroit is now left with about 20
square<00:02:45.780> miles<00:02:45.989> of<00:02:46.200> unused<00:02:46.560> land<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.640> long

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
square miles of unused land for a long

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.430 
square miles of unused land for a long
time<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.209> will<00:02:48.330> start<00:02:48.480> as<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.720> detriment<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
time this will start as a detriment to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.100 
time this will start as a detriment to
the<00:02:49.680> city<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> Detroit<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> since<00:02:51.510> then<00:02:51.810> are

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the city of Detroit but since then are

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.570 
the city of Detroit but since then are
in<00:02:52.230> more<00:02:52.560> modern<00:02:52.709> days<00:02:53.010> people<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.370> starting

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
in more modern days people are starting

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.729 
in more modern days people are starting
to<00:02:53.610> think<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:54.060> as<00:02:54.840> 20<00:02:55.170> square<00:02:55.380> miles<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
to think of as 20 square miles of

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.590 
to think of as 20 square miles of
opportunity<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.480> do

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
opportunity so it's like what can we do

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.050 
opportunity so it's like what can we do
with<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.840> land<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.410> there's<00:02:59.340> urban<00:02:59.670> farming

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
with this land so there's urban farming

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.759 
with this land so there's urban farming
there's<00:03:00.239> all<00:03:00.330> sorts<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.600> things<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.560> right

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
there's all sorts of things but right

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.650 
there's all sorts of things but right
now<00:03:01.920> we're<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.130> an<00:03:02.250> area<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.790> has<00:03:03.269> had<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.600> very

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
now we're in an area that has had a very

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.390 
now we're in an area that has had a very
creative<00:03:04.140> way<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.500> using<00:03:04.830> some<00:03:05.100> of<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.220> empty

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
creative way of using some of this empty

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.520 
creative way of using some of this empty
land<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.790> called<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.030> heidelberg<00:03:06.420> project

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
land it's called the heidelberg project

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.479 
land it's called the heidelberg project
so<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> heidelberg<00:03:08.010> project<00:03:08.040> was<00:03:08.430> started

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
so the heidelberg project was started

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.160 
so the heidelberg project was started
back<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.880> nineteen<00:03:09.030> eighty-six<00:03:09.690> by<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.959> man

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
back in nineteen eighty-six by a man

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
back in nineteen eighty-six by a man
named<00:03:10.350> Tyree<00:03:10.620> Guyton<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.519> he<00:03:11.640> grew<00:03:11.850> up<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.000> his

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
named Tyree Guyton and he grew up in his

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.220 
named Tyree Guyton and he grew up in his
neighborhood<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.570> he<00:03:12.630> noticed<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> lot<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
neighborhood and he noticed a lot of the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.009 
neighborhood and he noticed a lot of the
houses<00:03:13.380> were<00:03:13.680> coming<00:03:13.950> very<00:03:14.100> blighted<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:15.019> a

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
houses were coming very blighted and a

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.810 
houses were coming very blighted and a
lot<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.560> negative<00:03:16.920> things<00:03:17.160> were<00:03:17.340> happening<00:03:17.519> in

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
lot of negative things were happening in

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.210 
lot of negative things were happening in
the<00:03:17.940> area<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> call<00:03:19.530> attention<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the area and so to call attention to the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.590 
the area and so to call attention to the
problems<00:03:20.579> which<00:03:20.730> are<00:03:20.820> largely<00:03:21.090> being<00:03:21.360> ignored

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
problems which are largely being ignored

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.060 
problems which are largely being ignored
both<00:03:21.870> by<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.079> city<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.440> Detroit<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.950> the

both by the city of Detroit and the
