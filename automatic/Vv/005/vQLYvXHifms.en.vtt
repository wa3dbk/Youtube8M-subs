00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.520
 hello friends by courtesy of ximÃ©nez 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.350
 I'm going to show you 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.599
 how to access the internet 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.679
 from your computer using a Nokia 5800 phone 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.019
 we need two things for this 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.400
 the first thing is to have this phone 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.339
 with a plan they say no or limited 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.519
 because a plan to understand and lived 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.739
 because if we do not have to disclose on the phone anymore then a door 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.859
 huge and that's not the idea 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279
 the second sk the configuration 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.620
 who has the phone 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.420
 spencer internet 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.260
 what do we want to configure 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.900
 because this we very much cut down a program on the computer and we need 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.260
 pass it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.110
 let's give that configuration 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.740
 let's go to the menu 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.950
 configurations 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.060
 community 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.670
 like a little 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.820
 and let's go 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
 where it appears a planet driving destinations 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.580
 another planet internet 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.989
 funds in applications 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.470
 we enter and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.200
 how can you see 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 here all the phone configuration comes out 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.710
 in this case the configuration of movistar comes out and they accompany it use 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.480
 we are interested 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.370
 on behalf of the access point on the old shoulders and the password 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.690
 those three points 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.830
 on behalf of points is in this case it would be 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.000
 point you mobile points efe 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 on shoulders equally and the password that is not seen 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.440
 all of that we go back 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.880
 until you reach connectivity 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.070
 spa the last option 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.610
 next to the 1000 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.900
 we want and leave something like paquita and data we enter 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.540
 I made cat pack collection 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.250
 we enter and leave two sets and it is available if necessary we have to type 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 if it is necessary that we are going to accept 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.020
 down exit access point 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.210
 we enter and write 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.389
 point the moving points in this case I do not write here the ateneo set 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:11.229
 to accept 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.459
 stumble we have list 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.229
 the configuration 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.269
 the phone that we copied it to 1 brown a piece of paper where not as ema 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.999
 the idea is to copy the 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.379
 for later 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.169
 going to the computer 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.209
 this would be the first part configuration now let's go to the second 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.159
 part 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.620
 it would be the conclusions
