00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hard is it to run video for batman

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.079 
hard is it to run video for batman
arkham<00:00:04.920> knight<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.700> cool<00:00:05.879> thing<00:00:06.029> about

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.760 
arkham knight and the cool thing about
batman<00:00:06.569> arkham<00:00:06.750> knight<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.170> they<00:00:07.319> actually<00:00:07.649> do

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
batman arkham knight is they actually do

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.589 
batman arkham knight is they actually do
a<00:00:07.799> three<00:00:08.250> layered<00:00:08.610> system<00:00:08.910> requirements

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
a three layered system requirements

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.060 
a three layered system requirements
settings<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.110> they<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> minimum<00:00:10.830> system

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
settings so they have a minimum system

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.039 
settings so they have a minimum system
requirement<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.759> ended<00:00:12.330> system<00:00:12.630> requirement

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
requirement of ended system requirement

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.270 
requirement of ended system requirement
and<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.290> an<00:00:13.380> ultra<00:00:13.769> settings<00:00:13.950> system

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and then an ultra settings system

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.799 
and then an ultra settings system
requirement<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.389> something<00:00:15.540> I've<00:00:15.780> been

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
requirement this is something I've been

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.660 
requirement this is something I've been
vouching<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.350> more<00:00:16.800> developers<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.490> do

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
vouching for more developers to do

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
vouching for more developers to do
because<00:00:17.910> minimum<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.660> recommended<00:00:18.690> really

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
because minimum and recommended really

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
because minimum and recommended really
you<00:00:19.619> can't<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.039> gauge<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.850> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you can't really gauge on what kind of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
you can't really gauge on what kind of
settings<00:00:21.330> you're<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> get<00:00:21.810> especially

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
settings you're going to get especially

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.080 
settings you're going to get especially
because<00:00:22.619> recommended<00:00:23.220> usually<00:00:23.640> doesn't<00:00:24.000> let

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
because recommended usually doesn't let

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.580 
because recommended usually doesn't let
you<00:00:24.180> max<00:00:24.420> out<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> game<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.019> get<00:00:25.109> 60<00:00:25.410> frames

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you max out the game and get 60 frames

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
you max out the game and get 60 frames
per<00:00:25.710> second<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.580> batman<00:00:26.910> arkham<00:00:27.060> knight

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
per second so with batman arkham knight

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.759 
per second so with batman arkham knight
you<00:00:27.480> get<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> minimum<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> recommend

let's get right into this with the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.290 
let's get right into this with the
minimum<00:00:37.950> CP<00:00:38.340> requirement<00:00:38.879> you're<00:00:38.969> looking<00:00:39.239> at

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
minimum CP requirement you're looking at

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410 
minimum CP requirement you're looking at
an<00:00:39.390> intel<00:00:39.719> core<00:00:39.750> i5<00:00:40.050> 750<00:00:40.770> 2.67<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:42.000> her<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.329> an

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
an intel core i5 750 2.67 get her to an

x4<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.149> figured<00:00:51.660> some<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> guys<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
x4 I figured some of you guys have that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.200 
x4 I figured some of you guys have that
CPU<00:00:53.070> still<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.789> prominent

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
CPU still that was a really prominent

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
CPU still that was a really prominent

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
four years ago cool to see it's still

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.389

be<00:01:21.119> fine<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.200> i5<00:01:22.470> 2500<00:01:23.130> k

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
be fine if you do have like an i5 2500 k

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
be fine if you do have like an i5 2500 k
or<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> 3570k<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> 46<00:01:25.439> 90<00:01:25.680> k<00:01:25.799> i<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> would

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
or a 3570k or a 46 90 k i think it would

be<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.610> fine<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.420> recommending

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
as far as recommended GPU requirements

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.170 
as far as recommended GPU requirements
go<00:02:40.739> but<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.130> also<00:02:41.340> recommends<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.000> have

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
go but it also recommends that you have

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
only come with 2 gigabytes but that

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.590 
only come with 2 gigabytes but that
shouldn't<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.280> too<00:02:47.310> big<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.910> deal<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.510> not

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
shouldn't be too big of a deal it's not

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.820 
shouldn't be too big of a deal it's not
like<00:02:48.690> it's<00:02:48.959> gonna<00:02:49.049> kill<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.440> game<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
like it's gonna kill the game if you

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.289 
like it's gonna kill the game if you
only<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.160> two<00:02:50.340> gigabytes<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.850> video<00:02:50.970> memory

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.000 
only have two gigabytes of video memory

and then for the ultra system
requirements<00:02:53.459> you're<00:02:53.549> looking<00:02:53.760> at<00:02:53.850> an<00:02:53.940> nvidia

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
requirements you're looking at an nvidia

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.530 
requirements you're looking at an nvidia
geforce<00:02:54.900> gtx<00:02:55.470> 980<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.760> pretty<00:02:57.000> extreme<00:02:57.239> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
geforce gtx 980 that's pretty extreme to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.320 
geforce gtx 980 that's pretty extreme to
jump<00:02:57.810> from<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:58.019> gtx<00:02:58.470> 760<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> gtx<00:02:59.700> 980<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.299> I

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
jump from a gtx 760 to a gtx 980 but I

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.640 
jump from a gtx 760 to a gtx 980 but I
guess<00:03:00.569> that's<00:03:00.599> necessary<00:03:01.290> when<00:03:01.500> you're

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
guess that's necessary when you're

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.050 
guess that's necessary when you're
running<00:03:01.830> things<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.250> physics<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.880> all<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
running things like physics and all the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
different Nvidia game works and things

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.199 
different Nvidia game works and things
like<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.250> are<00:03:05.489> gonna<00:03:05.670> need<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.940> higher

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
like that you are gonna need a higher

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.460 
like that you are gonna need a higher
energy<00:03:06.420> pure<00:03:06.780> especially<00:03:07.290> if<00:03:07.349> you're

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
energy pure especially if you're

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.809 
energy pure especially if you're
applying<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.830> higher<00:03:08.040> end<00:03:08.250> resolution<00:03:08.730> like

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
applying at a higher end resolution like

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.000 
applying at a higher end resolution like
a<00:03:08.880> 1440p<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.230> also<00:03:10.380> recommends<00:03:10.830> four

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
a 1440p and it also recommends four

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.350 
a 1440p and it also recommends four

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
1980s come with so yes won this game

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.860 
1980s come with so yes won this game
maxed<00:03:14.819> out<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.060> looks<00:03:15.209> like<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.540> going<00:03:15.780> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
maxed out it looks like it is going to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.569 
maxed out it looks like it is going to
be<00:03:15.900> pretty<00:03:16.110> stressful<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:16.859> machine<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.489> if

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
be pretty stressful on a machine but if

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.130 
be pretty stressful on a machine but if
you<00:03:17.670> tend<00:03:17.910> something's<00:03:18.450> off<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> Nvidia

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
you tend something's off like the Nvidia

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.690 
you tend something's off like the Nvidia
game<00:03:19.380> works<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.829> turn<00:03:19.980> off<00:03:20.100> physics<00:03:20.519> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
game works and turn off physics and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.979 
game works and turn off physics and
things<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.390> are<00:03:21.510> gonna<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.810> able

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
to run this game with a mid-level GPU

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.410 
to run this game with a mid-level GPU
like<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> gtx<00:03:24.480> 760<00:03:25.140> or<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> gtx<00:03:25.950> 960<00:03:26.459> are<00:03:26.670> 9280<00:03:27.180> of
