00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730
 yes 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.129
 hello good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.869
 nights depending on what they are seeing 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.189
 this video speaks to them juan carlos jimÃ©nez 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.230
 and continuing with this course on 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.000
 blender in this chapter we are going to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.590
 explain a little about how to do 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 hierarchies or making connections 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 let's say with respect to the objects that 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.140
 we're going to make up our 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 character as we see here for example I 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.930
 all the objects we will see by 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 example I move them and they are 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 completely independent one from another 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 or that this one I can this if I want 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.739
 move a one because this one does not do not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 example here the body if I move it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.320
 everything else stays in its place and 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.420
 then this well then maybe I do not 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 may be beneficial for some 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 aspects for example of animation not 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 only animation also 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.969
 of design that I do not want anymore 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 example I want an object to be united 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.350
 to another in some way ok or for less 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.969
 dependent on the other and good for this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 let's just use a logic 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.640
 that connects from father to son that is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.979
 a logic that many are used 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 programs not only in selling in the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 majority of 3-d animation programs 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
 and good in general in the programs 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.920
 of design and this is just the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 confrontation or lage the hierarchies of 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.340
 the objects is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.900
 that depends on another and in turn another that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.970
 does not necessarily depend on the first or 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.620
 if that then depends on the rule 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.900
 that you apply for this there is a 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.090
 rule that says it's the showdown 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
 that is, the father sends the son but the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 son does not necessarily send the father is 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.060
 say the superior object that would be the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.860
 father makes the child dependent plus the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 son does not depend on the father therefore 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.580
 for example we can not apply this 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 rule let's do as we're going to see 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.620
 how this happens for example here in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.990
 our in our 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.150
 in our character ok let's put it 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 in perspective and good as we are going to 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.550
 to be able to do this we are going to do it from the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.080
 next way 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:01.560
 for example I select this arm 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.810
 and I will now select the body 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.240
 remember that we do it with this with 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 shift and we have already see that the first 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.489
 selected object lights up red and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 the second orange yes yes I in this 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:20.209
 moment I give control 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.489
 he says he gives me the option to accept 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.410
 just this change and where it says that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.209
 the object is going to be depends on this relative 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.910
 or is going to be more than relative is going to be 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.890
 dependent on the father and ok and in this 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.630
 moment for example let's select 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 this and the object of the body if I 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.489
 I move we see that it moves with all the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.260
 ok arm the z control seems to do 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.510
 promotion in exchange and selected the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.760
 arm I can only move so 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.830
 independent of the body ok 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.870
 that is, this rule what it says is 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.340
 basically that the son does what the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.049
 father says but it is not necessary but the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.959
 father does not do what the son says is 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.540
 say the father decides if he moves the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.579
 son moves or he knows control z but 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 if the child moves the father does not move 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.269
 only he moves ok then that's 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.090
 This is the hierarchy the father say 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.440
 and son inside the objects then 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.879
 well in this way others can create 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.760
 just hierarchies for example that 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.099
 we have the head but this hierarchy 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.359
 basically from a logic 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.099
 we can select different objects 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.079
 but who is going to be the father is going to be 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.370
 the last one that we select remember that 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.829
 this one when I in selections put 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 red and this one got orange the outline 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.340
 because because this was the one that became 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.870
 dependent on this one he went first that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.730
 I chose the last one I chose was this one 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.079
 so this was the father if I for 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.810
 example I want to select here the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.430
 objects that I have in my head yes and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.480
 I want them to be dependent for example 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.040
 I want this to be dependent on this one 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.440
 then as I select it 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.500
 I select first this I give this 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.150
 the control but I give shift to 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.950
 select the second then the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.560
 first that you select you put on you put 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.130
 red I give this control pe to give it 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.900
 the object dependence and here I already have 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.060
 for example this dependence if I move 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.510
 for example use of select 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.760
 everything if I select the eye we see that 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.290
 it does not move with everything and the and this and the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.799
 eyelid what is there chased selected 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.540
 the eyelid does not move anymore so ok this 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.310
 it suits to say to work it of this other 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.890
 way we can generate just parents 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.540
 and children or what would be something like a 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.130
 a family tree let's say with all the 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.930
 body by calling it somehow not 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.430
 that is to say, it suits me to be 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.750
 dependent on this plus the in change 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.040
 these where they should be 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.930
 dependent on the head and so 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.850
 successively no or these three is to say 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.670
 the eyes and the head we will do by 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.830
 example now I select this one 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.060
 selected this selected this we go 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.510
 to select this this 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.790
 and finally this and selected the eye 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.290
 excuse me, everyone else is 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.460
 in red nothing but the head in yellow 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.919
 it means that you were in the father of 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.870
 all the father of all the others ok and 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.409
 let's give it control p 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.539
 object 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.309
 of we select everything and for example 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 Now if I move my head 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:07.119
 everything else moves with the head 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.779
 but what happened I this time I did not 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.179
 select 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.649
 the eyelid last time I had 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:12.879
 made dependent on the eye at the moment of 

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:14.259
 move the eye also moves the 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.839
 eyelid but in this case as I do not 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.110
 select either one or the other no it does not 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:21.339
 it moved ok let's see control z let's go 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.499
 to come back we're going to do 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.089
 remove dependency let's do 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.270
 now dependent for example this 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:31.090
 Eyelid of the eye ok 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.000
 control p 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.900
 in this way we already have this this 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.880
 eye this eyelid depends depends on the eye 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.910
 not this eyelid also depends on this 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.130
 another eye ok ok now let's select 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.900
 for example this the eyes ok the nose and 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.990
 the head is to say that they depend on 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.550
 the head we give control fish ok ya 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.440
 they all depend on the head 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.900
 but first of all it's the eyelids 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.669
 they depend on the eyes and now the eyes and 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.440
 the head but both eyes and nose 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.970
 depend on the head therefore the 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.790
 eyelids also depend on the head 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.200
 ok it is like this logic let alone 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.180
 as from a family tree not the 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.440
 grandparents or parents also depend on 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.979
 the grandparents therefore the grandson 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.630
 it depends on the grandfather ok we go to this one 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.220
 select everything and let's see it now 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.830
 if I move my head without selecting 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.690
 nothing else we see that moves everything ok what 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.210
 we can do it with each part of the 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.289
 body 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.289
 let's do it for example 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:36.449
 that arms and arms 

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:39.869
 the feet the tie and the head all 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.459
 they depend on the body ok i give it 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:42.539
 control but we see that everything else 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.229
 it is in red the only thing that is in 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.360
 yellow 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.429
 let's say this outlined in yellow 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.119
 the body means that that is the father 

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:53.699
 I give him control, I accept, and now I do 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.409
 already for example if I move and remember here 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.909
 no longer select the head forgiveness no longer 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.789
 select the nose or the eyes and 

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:01.200
 eyelids only the pure head what 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:04.260
 higher 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.820
 in the tie on the arms and feet and 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.080
 let's see what he can show off when the 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.020
 body we see that now moves 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.120
 completely everything yes and I for example 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.290
 I can already select each one and then 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.360
 good and everything is and there is a certain 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.280
 dependence between one object and another that 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.100
 there is an abnormal dependence , let's say 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.810
 is suitable for my purposes, not because 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.330
 good one would be all this in terms of 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.340
 how to work hierarchies and dependencies 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.110
 of father and son between objects that 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.270
 they behave make up fairly in the 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.510
 I invite you to keep watching 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.710
 this this course on selling that is 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.480
 subscribe to be given and what 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.610
 share that they see the other courses that 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.440
 has been going up on this photoshop 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.120
 kings written most of them are 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.740
 of opensource the idea is that it is 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.020
