00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.020 
so adding another player will just
extend<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.680> time<00:04:35.950> frame<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:36.280> if<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:36.850> have

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
extend that time frame so if you have

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300 
extend that time frame so if you have
the<00:04:37.180> time<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.500> then<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.710> want<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.980> do<00:04:39.130> it
