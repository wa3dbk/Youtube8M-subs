00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.350
 well dear koller friends we have succeeded 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.260
 to find him before he arrives in Italy 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.210
 iphone 5 c 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.640
 as you know it should arrive in Italy 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.029
 by December of this year of 2013 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.589
 let's see what the. contains 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.720
 original sales package 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.600
 we bought it in the coloring 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.329
 blue is also available in 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:44.780
 green yellow and white red color 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.059
 the features are very similar to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.840
 those of the iPhone 5 is if what 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:56.210
 change is the frame that made in 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.440
 polycarbonate therefore a material 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:06.800
 certainly resistant but inferior 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 compared to the aluminum of the iPhone 5 s 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.490
 as I said we are going to open the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.220
 sales package that includes a 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.500
 charger with usb port in this 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.909
 case having taken him to England 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:30.560
 we have an English poem by 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:34.000
 stereo earphones and micro connector 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:39.619
 usb lighting to connect to the pc and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 recharge it with regards to the cover 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:49.320
 back I told you that made in 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.550
 polycarbonate to the touch looks ceramic 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.680
 it is very pleasant however to the touch and from 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:03.680
 however, a feeling of solidity 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 let's see the firmware that mounts 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.979
 this iphone 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 here it is firmware 7.0 and paul already has 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.780
 released an update 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.160
 as you see the thing that catches your eye 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.640
 that unlike the iPhone 5 s 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.900
 there is no touch into practice 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.569
 fingerprint recognition 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.940
 we'll try it to unlock the phone 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.150
 during these days then 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.519
