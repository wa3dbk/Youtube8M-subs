00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.199
 hello friends of youtube alchemical what 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.839
 commenting today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.679
 pretty simple how to protect 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.679
 our house 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.380
 a defensive turret 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.210
 for this we need 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.170
 one 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.610
 blocks that do not fall by gravity 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.000
 how can it be stone 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.730
 It is a block of gold diamond ice 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.150
 of whatever it is but that does not fall by the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.340
 gravity because sand or gravel does not 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.559
 it serves to build what is the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.600
 turret that is for what is going to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.080
 serve this block 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.130
 2nd snow a block of snow that is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.180
 get it raised 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.010
 through the storage room table he makes 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.390
 that is if I'm not wrong with 4 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.930
 snowballs 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.910
 and third 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 pumpkin that is the one that is 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.290
 normally around the world 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.180
 and we started 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.820
 well, we have to do what 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 next we have to make this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.380
 shape so that there is a small 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.920
 hollow here after here we put a support 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.370
 which we put here and this one we remove 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.590
 because it no longer serves us and also I do not 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.060
 removes visibility for what we're going to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.500
 do afterwards it will be removed 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.800
 visibility to the guardian as it does now 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 we do this we get in here or if what 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.780
 we can enter not because we do not have the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 creative we put here and here and after 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.810
 if we can not come up with one with earth 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.280
 for better 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.950
 and now we do this 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.390
 and we create 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.080
 snow man like me you 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.970
 I call 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:36.260
 and this is what he does mainly 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.340
 Well, this is mainly the enemy that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.040
 this man of the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.770
 snow to us will not attack us anymore 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.230
 that we are their masters as well 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.540
 say it 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.769
 this mainly the bases away to 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.069
 the zombies spider create ill 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.260
 aggressive that they want to attack us 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:03.549
 get away from us and also makes you 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.879
 a minimum that is pretty little bit 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.260
 little pretty minimal damage because strip 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.569
 throw snowballs 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.769
 and to check it 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.769
 I'm going to catch 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.990
 creep games the good flu but 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.280
 for example spiders 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.280
 or zombies 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.060
 yes i know he took off 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.770
 he took off the creative 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:42.930
 and I put the night 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.760
 here good as you see now all come 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.610
 all the most aggressive ones that come out by the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.720
 night are fine and write if for example 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.720
 We put here as you see 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.700
 with the same bale as is normal 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.879
 but this tower was 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.590
 once too much they are going to kill me but 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:11.370
 good but as you can see it is this doll 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.370
 of snow then 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.310
 well more killed as you see good we do 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.430
 we protect what is basically 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 as you have seen 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.870
 They will be charged and will be charged has 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.080
 come a charged but good washer 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:36.229
 if we want to welcome a sword 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.229
 They 're going to kill me more times than we're going 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.060
 good is something free 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.580
 if there are no enemies that can be 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.580
 can destroy 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.729
 our snowman complete the 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.340
 snow or whatever you want to call it we can 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.560
 do one thing that is 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.220
 to see here 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:16.500
 we can do this how good what 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.500
 who lives and well that takes away visibility 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:25.200
 but good can be useful for 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.200
 so that it lasts longer 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.630
 our snowman and if you already 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.440
 we do like rapier 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.000
 what is good really this we would have 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.520
 what 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.210
 that leave it to build here our 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.450
 snowman and then cover it with what 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:51.470
 that was and well here what happens is 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:54.380
 why not good visibility 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.830
 of snowman to attack would be very 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.800
 minimum 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.290
 but it would last longer if you will not be charged 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.300
 which would mainly be charged to 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:07.920
 our snowman that would be 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.070
 goalkeeper 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.640
 that they would destroy us with their arrows 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:16.320
 would destroy our snowman and 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.520
 well that 's all 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.520
