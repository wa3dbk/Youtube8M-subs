00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
just comes with the circle base which

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.979 
just comes with the circle base which
helps<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.270> stand<00:02:09.349> against<00:02:10.349> tans<00:02:10.640> fairly<00:02:11.640> well

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
helps it stand against tans fairly well

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.880 
helps it stand against tans fairly well
without<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> base<00:02:13.319> but

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
