patterns almost impossible though might
have<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.750> go<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.960> the<00:03:49.050> garbage<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:51.480> got<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> few

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
have to go in the garbage you got a few

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.210 
have to go in the garbage you got a few
pieces<00:03:52.110> off<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.770> anyway<00:03:54.800> ok<00:03:55.800> this<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
pieces off of it anyway ok this is the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.860 
pieces off of it anyway ok this is the
largest<00:03:56.610> chunk<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.150> could<00:03:57.360> find

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:22.590 

let's<00:04:03.409> see<00:04:03.590> what<00:04:03.739> will<00:04:03.890> happen<00:04:04.150> Peter<00:04:05.150> up

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.310 

nothing

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:37.050 

I<00:04:26.410> think<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.130> crack

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.120
