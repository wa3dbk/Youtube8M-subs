00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
new black ops disc and inside were two

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910 
new black ops disc and inside were two
more<00:01:20.790> codes<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.390> i<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:22.170> very<00:01:22.200> surprised<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
more codes so i was very surprised to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 
more codes so i was very surprised to
find<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.250> happy<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.180> too

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
find this happy that it was in there too

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
find this happy that it was in there too
so<00:01:25.170> instead<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.130> downloading<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.479> myself

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so instead of downloading it for myself

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
so instead of downloading it for myself
since<00:01:27.990> i<00:01:28.140> already<00:01:28.200> had<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:28.860> nuketown<00:01:29.579> map<00:01:29.640> i

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
since i already had them nuketown map i

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
since i already had them nuketown map i
thought<00:01:30.240> maybe<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.829> way

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
thought maybe this would be a good way

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.539 
thought maybe this would be a good way

game

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.360 
game
I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> lot<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:12.900> fun<00:02:13.230> than<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
I think it's a lot more fun than the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.960 
I think it's a lot more fun than the
first<00:02:14.610> black<00:02:15.210> ops<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.470> maps<00:02:16.710> are<00:02:17.040> better<00:02:17.670> it's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
first black ops the maps are better it's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
first black ops the maps are better it's
a<00:02:18.090> lot<00:02:18.240> faster<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.900> graphics<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.650> much

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a lot faster the graphics are so much

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.990 
a lot faster the graphics are so much
better<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.400> that's<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> would

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
better and like that's what you would

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.890 
better and like that's what you would
expect<00:02:21.300> from<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.290> second<00:02:22.680> game<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.900> mean

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
expect from the second game so I mean

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.040 
expect from the second game so I mean
the<00:02:25.020> more<00:02:25.200> recent<00:02:25.410> game<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.780> want<00:02:27.960> to
