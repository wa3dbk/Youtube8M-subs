00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.340
 before first let's talk about something 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.649
 everyone has by far the best 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.320
 Less has asked me a lot, I 'm 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.640
 seeing this and saying that the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.899
 staff has doubts about something so 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 simple 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.320
 There are many tvs notebooks welcome with 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.019
 intel hd graphics are today 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.679
 we are going to talk about it not necessarily 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.069
 intel genial another family that is in 

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.690
 exchange charts and most of the time 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:01:00.140
 accompanied with staff from 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.149
 so in bigger cases people are 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.200
 just wants to know 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.030
 a setup to play dn with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.549
 better quality if it is proved that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:16.850
 such a notebook that I bought from cef 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.970
 o aspire 43 49 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.850
 I took the factory with 2gb increase 4 and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.650
 accepts at most eight good is not me 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.640
 surprised because it has a quality 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.920
 great for games games from here 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.490
 street fighter live left for there 2013 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.290
 the fifa 13 what else is I got here as of 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.870
 contain 30 to 40 of oil, which should 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.660
 pizzolio 3 also has a weird way 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.340
 Calm down then it's right 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.420
 the stretch of 3 already but I think it was 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 performed in the configuration of the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.630
 video right- click properties 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.150
 graphics is very simple myself 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.150
 I always prefer here the advanced mode 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.450
 because you'll get a breakdown of it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.360
 in the case here three of mine and energy 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.400
 which we are going to do first in 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.970
 maximum resolution on your computer 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.300
 put up in 3d 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.890
 here was doing the tests do not play 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.620
 here on the balance that was advised 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.080
 quality apply ok 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.410
 always leave in quality the stage that already 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.760
 tested a fair balance has to say 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.530
 Obvious you will let the performance go 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.000
 have a better performance at stake will not 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.590
 suck 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.320
 the graph and you will start to get 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.880
 Brava was already chubby and can not play 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.360
 in the quality that the plate of the maximum 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.180
 five 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.070
 I advised staff to do this who 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.880
 have a notebook with at least four 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.420
 edit two tell what happened leaving 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.030
 balanced that unfortunately the sentence 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 the ctt really deny but in the case 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.140
 we are talking about inter in the game with 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.510
 performance quality taking 4 gb 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.210
 processor as long as you keep the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.760
 quality of energy to the secret here 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.400
 and if I 'm not mistaken by factory in the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.500
 balance some realm of the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.600
 run the battery but leave 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.470
 maximum performance for him to take full 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.670
 I already was if I did not have clicks and apply 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.610
 Ok, you 're reminded if you have it on your 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.080
 energy world music always leaves the 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.570
 our performance when playing 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.880
 Okay. I'm sure the games will go. 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.460
 run better at that time using the 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.110
 fantasy using here or sony vegas that 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.970
 I am preparing a video a plate 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.090
 very good video loads a lot 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 the pit will quiet soon enough will 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.470
 post what more victories is teaching 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.950

 it's a file he'll use your 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.790
 computer guy is very strong even 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.860
 and also gives some tips on how to 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 also rather than 76 quite a thing is 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.260
 emergency spy using bricks in the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.900
 good do not use Basque do not use even you 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.400
