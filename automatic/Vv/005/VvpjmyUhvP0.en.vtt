00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
on the motor throttle and it's really

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:26.120 
on the motor throttle and it's really
pretty<00:00:12.750> zippy<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:25.289> don't<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> hold<00:00:25.980> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
it's much safer having the canoe

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's much safer having the canoe
