00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello everyone we are cooking with you without barmak 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.849
 or 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 it is called beshbarmak or just without 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.309
 Here I live in Kazakhstan therefore very 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.650
 I personally know this dish 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 put in the first place of all dishes 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 which I love and because I live in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.590
 Kazakhstan because it is very tasty 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 in the second one is useful because in it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.619
 there is boiled proteins i mean meat 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.960
 and carbohydrates all boiled plus tour 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:41.129
 on all topics in general take the pot 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 here I threw the bones of a ram here but 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 Basically, I just did not stay and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.140
 cooked kebabs and along the way I'm with you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.530
 now throwing myasko beef it here 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.030
 he just helped 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.289
 Here we have such a large amount 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 By the way beef must be fat 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.790
 go too bones desirable if you are not 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.090
 will lay bone in common bones and meat 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 and fat should be mandatory here 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 it will turn out we just awesome 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.810
 the rich broth is the first second 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 it is generally advisable to cook wish for mac 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 purely from viburnum or purely with camino or 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.170
 can be used as a fireplace beef 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.520
 plus mutton you can still lay it all down 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 put shu beetle well, many probably do not know 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.909
 what it is by will become lived in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.560
 Kazakhstan small step this such a sausage 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.100
 which is present 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.670
 horse meat plus him marinate there in 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.259
 Overall sausage is awesome with above and super 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.360
 just upper class 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.840
 The first time I tried was not particularly 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.509
 understood the taste and but when and once tried it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 just awesome just any sausage 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.360
 resting what is produced that is it 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.270
 in general, there is one solid fat from 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.909
 evy from this protein 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.190
 herbal therefore do not recommend it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.610
 now we'll fill it with water by the way 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.970
 what so far add dining room here 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:21.460
 a spoonful of salt will not cook with you so we 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 all the water and poured salted turn on 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.880
 maximum fire and bring to a boil 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.150
 before we will add it down first 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 the second one also takes off the foam when 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.820
 appear to have broth 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.620
 transparent, we all basically everything further 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.150
 we will continue we will need 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.150
 tortillas and onions principle all who never 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.520
 I did not try this dish necessarily 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.400
 try if you live in Russia in 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.610
 Ukraine or in other countries 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 usually many people do not know about it 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.440
 but when they try coming to Kazakhstan 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.100
 they cook it all the time 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:09.360
 try principle we cook everything as usual 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:12.550
 meat and bring down all close the lid and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.100
 boil without helping ahead to another 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 pot bigger and I was here already begins 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.450
 boil so and begin to collect here 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.060
 our retirement is our stump as we collect 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.860
 foam 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.100
 In principle, I almost boiled over 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.760
 will turn down the heat on four and cook 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.360
 until cooked meat we cooked with 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.360
 you will continue 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.690
 so we continue to cook our beshbarmak 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.410
 so I have all cooked pot I 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.410
 open and pulled out and away our meat 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.360
 cooled down shifting here 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.360
 wings 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.430
 grill it turned out so wonderful 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.540
 then our meat is cold as for 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.130
 cakes we need cakes in general 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.479
 us store is already sold without 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:25.560
 formal cakes such here if u 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.240
 you do not have then you can roll egg rinus 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.910
 preparing it is very simple mooga in flour 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.270
 water salt principle is all rolled out 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.780

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.020
 they will boil in broth already and 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.050
 we sell sliced ​​or you can 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.199
 dough still add a testicle so at all 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:05:00.699
 proceed we will also need onions 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:05:02.590
 more tasty and that is all turns out 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.740
