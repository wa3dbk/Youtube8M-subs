00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
wheel and what you're gonna notice even

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.890 
wheel and what you're gonna notice even
though<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.549> a<00:02:12.579> 72<00:02:13.030> millimeter<00:02:13.600> tall

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
though this is a 72 millimeter tall

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.680 
though this is a 72 millimeter tall
wheel<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.760> has<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> pretty<00:02:16.390> shallow

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
wheel that it has a pretty shallow

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.289 
wheel that it has a pretty shallow
urethane<00:02:17.380> depth<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.579> means<00:02:18.790> even<00:02:19.269> more

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
urethane depth so that means even more

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.590 
urethane depth so that means even more
control<00:02:19.980> consistent<00:02:20.980> slides<00:02:21.310> all<00:02:21.640> day<00:02:22.269> long

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
control consistent slides all day long

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.140 
control consistent slides all day long
but<00:02:23.079> watch<00:02:23.290> out<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:24.370> these<00:02:24.670> wheels<00:02:24.940> are

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
but watch out because these wheels are

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.050 
but watch out because these wheels are
insanely<00:02:25.570> icy<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.829> will<00:02:27.130> bite<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.579> you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
insanely icy and they will bite you you

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.819 
insanely icy and they will bite you you
will<00:02:28.269> ice<00:02:28.450> out<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.350> will<00:02:29.530> hit<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
will ice out and you will hit the

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.620 
will ice out and you will hit the
pavement<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.570> here

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
pavement like here and here

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.320 
pavement like here and here
now<00:02:34.630> let's<00:02:35.260> talk<00:02:35.410> about<00:02:35.680> kick<00:02:35.890> out<00:02:36.120> what<00:02:37.120> kick

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
now let's talk about kick out what kick

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.480 
now let's talk about kick out what kick
out<00:02:37.480> these<00:02:37.990> wheels<00:02:38.230> don't<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.710> one<00:02:38.950> because

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
out these wheels don't have one because

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790 
out these wheels don't have one because
they<00:02:39.820> are<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.060> dang<00:02:40.360> sliding<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.530> wheels

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
they are that dang sliding these wheels

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.100 
they are that dang sliding these wheels
when<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.340> go<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.670> go<00:02:42.940> turn<00:02:43.240> them<00:02:43.390> sideways<00:02:43.570> you

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
when you go to go turn them sideways you

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.720 
when you go to go turn them sideways you
just<00:02:44.140> think<00:02:44.620> about<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.250> then<00:02:45.520> you're

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
just think about it and then you're

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.750 
just think about it and then you're
going<00:02:45.910> sideways<00:02:46.300> think<00:02:47.110> slide<00:02:47.620> that's<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
going sideways think slide that's it and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.860 
going sideways think slide that's it and
one<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.970> my<00:02:49.030> favorite<00:02:49.360> things<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.690> do<00:02:49.780> with

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
these wheels is super low angle slides

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.870 
these wheels is super low angle slides
that<00:02:53.380> means<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.740> just<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.160> tweak<00:02:54.490> out<00:02:54.670> that
