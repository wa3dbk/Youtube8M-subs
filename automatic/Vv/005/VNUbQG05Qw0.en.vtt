00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
let me ask you a question and I want the

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.900 
let me ask you a question and I want the
honest<00:00:04.050> answer<00:00:04.230> when<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> new<00:00:04.979> model<00:00:05.310> comes<00:00:05.700> out

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
honest answer when a new model comes out

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.370 
honest answer when a new model comes out
I<00:00:06.029> should<00:00:06.269> have<00:00:06.359> say<00:00:06.450> when<00:00:06.599> an<00:00:06.720> update<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.319> a

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
I should have say when an update of a

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.900 
I should have say when an update of a
current<00:00:07.680> model<00:00:07.830> comes<00:00:08.160> out<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.790> ever

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
current model comes out do you ever

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.579 
current model comes out do you ever
really<00:00:09.330> check<00:00:09.690> any<00:00:09.900> noticed<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.379> have<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> look

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:10.589 
really check any noticed you have a look

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:11.629 
really check any noticed you have a look
at<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> spec<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.070> say<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.309> wonder<00:00:11.490> how

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
at the spec and say I wonder how

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.369 
at the spec and say I wonder how
different<00:00:11.879> is<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.389> think<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.019> honest<00:00:13.200> answer

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
different is I think the honest answer

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.350 
different is I think the honest answer
is<00:00:13.530> no<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.860> don't<00:00:14.009> really<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.700> certainly<00:00:15.120> don't

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
is no you don't really I certainly don't

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.430 
is no you don't really I certainly don't
because<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.959> gonna<00:00:16.049> have<00:00:16.200> a<00:00:16.230> few

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
because I know it's gonna have a few

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
because I know it's gonna have a few
extra<00:00:16.710> bits<00:00:16.860> stuck<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.610> few<00:00:17.970> cosmetic

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
extra bits stuck on it a few cosmetic

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.630 
extra bits stuck on it a few cosmetic
changes<00:00:18.990> probably<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.650> new<00:00:19.800> color<00:00:20.100> scheme<00:00:20.280> for

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
changes probably a new color scheme for

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150 
changes probably a new color scheme for
this<00:00:20.760> year<00:00:21.030> but<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.360> think<00:00:21.690> lastly<00:00:22.620> we<00:00:22.830> tend<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
this year but I think lastly we tend to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.790 
this year but I think lastly we tend to
ignore<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.940> the<00:00:24.150> spec<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.510> new<00:00:24.660> models<00:00:24.990> but

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
ignore all the spec on new models but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
ignore all the spec on new models but
when<00:00:25.920> hunter<00:00:26.160> brought<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.730> their<00:00:26.910> new

GL 1800 - boss - their new gold wing you

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.790 
GL 1800 - boss - their new gold wing you
can<00:00:30.690> hardly<00:00:30.990> ignore<00:00:31.350> it<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.620> absolutely

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
can hardly ignore it it's absolutely

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.439 
can hardly ignore it it's absolutely
huge<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> say<00:00:33.890> 1800<00:00:34.890> CCS<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.640> a

huge it is as I say 1800 CCS and a

huge it is as I say 1800 CCS and a
machine<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.870> size<00:00:37.109> is<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.440> difficult<00:00:38.249> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
acquired taste well maybe but once you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.149 
acquired taste well maybe but once you
climb<00:00:45.030> aboard<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.719> new<00:00:45.870> 1800<00:00:46.559> you'll<00:00:46.949> be

climb aboard the new 1800 you'll be

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.389 
climb aboard the new 1800 you'll be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
in fact the whole bike is different it's

in fact the whole bike is different it's
completely<00:01:10.990> different<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.470> all<00:01:11.650> previous

it's a different shape but it retains

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.100 
it's a different shape but it retains
somehow<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.360> don't<00:01:19.600> know<00:01:19.659> how<00:01:19.720> they've<00:01:19.899> managed

somehow I don't know how they've managed

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.719 
somehow I don't know how they've managed
to<00:01:20.229> design<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.830> but<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.100> retains<00:01:21.250> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
delivery as well the gearbox is a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.759 
delivery as well the gearbox is a
five-speed<00:02:37.150> well<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:37.690> saying<00:02:37.959> 5-speed<00:02:38.590> and

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
five-speed well I'm saying 5-speed and

five-speed well I'm saying 5-speed and
technically<00:02:39.130> I'm<00:02:39.250> wrong<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:39.640> because<00:02:39.910> if

technically I'm wrong there because if
you<00:02:40.120> read<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.420> information<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:41.079> call<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.440> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you read the information they call it a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.860 
you read the information they call it a
four-speed<00:02:42.100> plus<00:02:42.609> an<00:02:42.820> overdrive<00:02:43.420> because

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
four-speed plus an overdrive because

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.780 
four-speed plus an overdrive because
when<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.260> flick<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:44.890> up<00:02:44.980> into<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> top<00:02:45.519> you

this new goal wing because after all
it's<00:03:36.549> very<00:03:36.879> very<00:03:37.120> big<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.480> course<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:37.959> can

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
it's very very big of course as you can

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.920 
it's very very big of course as you can
see<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.440> very<00:03:38.470> very<00:03:38.739> heavy<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:40.030> weighs<00:03:40.180> 800

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
see it's very very heavy it weighs 800

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.509 
see it's very very heavy it weighs 800
pounds<00:03:40.959> that's<00:03:41.409> the<00:03:41.650> dry<00:03:41.950> weight<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.220> this

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
pounds that's the dry weight of this

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.399 
pounds that's the dry weight of this
thing<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:42.819> that's<00:03:43.239> what<00:03:43.450> third<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.230> ton

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409

thing so that's what third of a ton
there<00:03:44.769> abouts<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.819> you've<00:03:45.970> got<00:03:46.120> yourself

down the road so how we can say that

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.860 
down the road so how we can say that
something<00:03:54.340> that<00:03:54.549> weighs<00:03:54.700> half<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.150> ton<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.629> is
