00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all today I am 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.130
 really happy to meet you 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.899
 for this video where I'm going to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.650
 explain the principle of a new game 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.660
 hard skin lotto and lotto pokémon 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 what is it and well it's a game 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 very simple in a week I was pulling 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.670
 lots psy pokemon the first 50 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 pokedex and so you'll understand 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.810
 the goal to win is to do the right thing 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.849
 prognosis is to propose the six 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 pokemon that I will draw lots or 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 any case to find as much as possible 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 for that you have the whole week 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.130
 to make your proposal directly 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 in the comments of this video 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.230
 but be careful I would be extremely 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 strict about the rules you do not 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.820
 can make only one proposal and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 you have to propose only if 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.340
 pokemon no more any message that will 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.850
 edited or edited no matter the date 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.710
 will not be counted and finally your 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.739
 comment must be sent on this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.379
 video before 6 pm on Saturday 8 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.080
 next February I invite you too 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.180
 greatly to consult the regulation of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 this game I put the link in the details 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.520
 of the video the lion is on my 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 forum that also went to the event 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.960
 so I recap in a comment 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 you must offer me if pokemon among 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 the first 50 of the pokedex is between 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.549
 bulbizarre and topical hours your 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.400
 message will have to look pretty much like 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.170
 sand but wants my sense or more 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 important what can we gain 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.590
 well there are several blocks that I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 offers you but watch out for 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.700
 win you have to find 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.000
 interactively at least four good 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.860
 pokemon on six if that's the case and that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 you have four good opteaman on the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 six who will be drawn 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.399
 you have the right to choose between these 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 lint of various developments 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.350

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.540

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 with in addition a small word well 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.409

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.520
 bigger stuffed animals 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.800

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.530
 salamèche a weird sweater or a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.209
 big quarter could finally big fat 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.890
 I exaggerate a little bit they actually do little 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.910
 close that size there is 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.650
 on the other hand, there is no need to 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.350
 to win I'm sorry it's mine 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.870
 I'm sorry finally if you do 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.230

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.670
 not necessarily like you're 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.380
 too big a hard to receive 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.230
 stuffed animals or while you already have 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.840
 all the 3ds games that I propose you 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.560

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.540

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.019
 what's in it what can I 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 just tell you is that there can 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.150
 have a really rotten thing like a 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.400
 really good stuff inside 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.400
 the draw of the result will take place 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.860

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.049
 live so you can see me in 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.530

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.810
 pokemon 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.799

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.030
 that they are possible 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.220

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.079

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.780
