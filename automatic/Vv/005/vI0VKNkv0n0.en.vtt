00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
here we are with the fabulous ringworm

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.460 
here we are with the fabulous ringworm
ring<00:00:16.080> modulator<00:00:16.590> by<00:00:16.830> way<00:00:17.100> huge<00:00:17.430> electronics

ring modulator by way huge electronics

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.779 
ring modulator by way huge electronics
this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> ring<00:00:19.859> modulator<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.699> know

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
this is a ring modulator and if you know

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
this is a ring modulator and if you know
what<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.990> understand<00:00:22.470> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
what that is you you understand that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
what that is you you understand that
it's<00:00:22.800> capable<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.490> incredibly<00:00:24.210> wild

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it's capable of some incredibly wild

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.519 
it's capable of some incredibly wild
synth<00:00:25.920> type<00:00:26.220> sounds<00:00:26.869> but<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.109> pedal<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
synth type sounds but this pedal is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
synth type sounds but this pedal is
unique<00:00:28.890> because<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.490> blend<00:00:29.789> control

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
unique because it has a blend control

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
unique because it has a blend control
and<00:00:30.679> because<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> has<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> blend<00:00:32.160> control<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and because it has a blend control you

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
and because it has a blend control you
can<00:00:33.540> blend<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.590> guitar<00:00:34.920> tone<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
can blend it with your guitar tone and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
can blend it with your guitar tone and
use<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.120> way<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.690> would<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> normal

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
use it in a way that you would a normal

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.619 
use it in a way that you would a normal
stomp<00:00:37.649> box<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.480> affecting<00:00:39.480> your

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
stomp box where it's affecting your

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
stomp box where it's affecting your
sound<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.980> because<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:41.460> also<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> ring

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
sound but because it's also a ring

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
sound but because it's also a ring
modulator<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> capable<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> some<00:00:43.379> really

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
modulator and capable of some really

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.459 
modulator and capable of some really
wild<00:00:44.300> effects<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.379> an

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
wild effects it can also be an

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.520 
wild effects it can also be an
instrument<00:00:46.920> itself<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> create<00:00:48.809> sounds

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
instrument itself you can create sounds

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
instrument itself you can create sounds
that<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.460> coming<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.300> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
that are coming out of this thing you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049 
that are coming out of this thing you
can<00:00:51.690> compose<00:00:51.989> music<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.760> today<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.850> playing

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can compose music with today I'm playing

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.770 
can compose music with today I'm playing
my<00:00:54.239> Eric<00:00:54.539> Johnson<00:00:54.750> strat<00:00:55.399> into<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.670> jcm<00:00:57.449> 900

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
my Eric Johnson strat into a jcm 900

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.529 
my Eric Johnson strat into a jcm 900
Marshall<00:00:59.300> into<00:01:00.300> an<00:01:00.449> EVM<00:01:00.899> 12l<00:01:01.559> speaker<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.030> with

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
Marshall into an EVM 12l speaker so with

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.260 
Marshall into an EVM 12l speaker so with
the<00:01:03.629> blend<00:01:03.870> knob<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> left

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
the blend knob all the way to the left

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:15.240 
the blend knob all the way to the left
it's<00:01:06.270> basically<00:01:06.689> bypassed

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.910 

so<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.520> thing<00:01:16.729> that's<00:01:16.850> cool<00:01:17.090> about<00:01:17.920> ring

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
so one thing that's cool about ring

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.580 
so one thing that's cool about ring
modulators<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.640> can<00:01:19.790> tune<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.080> sound<00:01:21.409> that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
modulators you can tune the sound that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.020 
modulators you can tune the sound that
it's<00:01:21.710> going<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:21.979> generate<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.580> right<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:22.880> I'm

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's going to generate so right now I'm

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.359 
it's going to generate so right now I'm
going<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.299> demonstrate<00:01:23.810> by<00:01:24.350> putting<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
going to demonstrate by putting the

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.180 
going to demonstrate by putting the
blend<00:01:25.610> all<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.940> way<00:01:26.030> up<00:01:26.680> or<00:01:27.680> not<00:01:27.830> all<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.100> way

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
blend all the way up or not all the way

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.310 
blend all the way up or not all the way
up<00:01:28.310> about<00:01:28.549> half<00:01:28.759> way<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.210> I'm<00:01:29.960> going<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.170> move

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
up about half way and I'm going to move

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.440 
up about half way and I'm going to move
this<00:01:30.440> frequency<00:01:30.830> knob<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.399> I'm<00:01:32.180> going<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.360> be

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
this frequency knob and I'm going to be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:42.820 
this frequency knob and I'm going to be
playing<00:01:32.720> an<00:01:32.810> e<00:01:32.930> note<00:01:41.229> through<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.350> I'm<00:01:42.470> moving

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
playing an e note through the I'm moving

00:01:42.830 --> 00:02:02.470 
playing an e note through the I'm moving
through<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.250> octaves

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.840 

once<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.810> note<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:05.310> turn

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
once I get the note I like I can turn

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
once I get the note I like I can turn
the<00:02:06.030> blend<00:02:06.300> down<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:07.140> retain<00:02:07.500> more<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the blend down to retain more of the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:23.490 
the blend down to retain more of the
guitars<00:02:08.220> signature

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.559 

so<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> ability<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.159> blend<00:02:25.459> how<00:02:26.120> much<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
so the ability to blend how much of the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.520 
so the ability to blend how much of the
ring<00:02:26.720> modulators<00:02:27.790> frequency<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.530> blending

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
ring modulators frequency is blending

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.320 
ring modulators frequency is blending
with<00:02:30.650> your<00:02:30.769> guitar<00:02:30.890> tone<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.640> being<00:02:32.090> able<00:02:32.150> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
with your guitar tone and being able to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.610 
with your guitar tone and being able to
tune<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.780> note<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.200> you're<00:02:33.319> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.500> be

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
tune the note that you're going to be

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.339 
tune the note that you're going to be
playing<00:02:33.980> with<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.549> useful<00:02:35.450> feature<00:02:35.629> we<00:02:36.200> also

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
playing with is a useful feature we also

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.550 
playing with is a useful feature we also
have<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> ability<00:02:37.190> to<00:02:37.569> alter<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.750> frequency

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
have the ability to alter the frequency

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.000 
have the ability to alter the frequency
bite<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:41.450> use<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.049> width<00:02:42.260> controls<00:02:42.739> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
bite if we use the width controls and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.890 
bite if we use the width controls and
the<00:02:43.069> rate<00:02:43.400> controls<00:02:43.909> now<00:02:44.540> we're<00:02:44.690> going<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the rate controls now we're going to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.720 
the rate controls now we're going to
modulate<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.620> signal

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.910 

you<00:02:52.730> can<00:02:52.910> hear<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.450> ring<00:02:54.020> modulators<00:02:54.200> sound

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
you can hear the ring modulators sound

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:15.320 
you can hear the ring modulators sound
change<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.640> real-time<00:02:55.819> based<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.660> my<00:02:56.840> attack

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.540 

now<00:03:16.330> we<00:03:16.390> have<00:03:16.570> different<00:03:16.990> modes<00:03:17.460> what<00:03:18.460> you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
now we have different modes what you

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.100 
now we have different modes what you
just<00:03:18.670> heard<00:03:18.850> was<00:03:18.910> an<00:03:19.150> envelope<00:03:19.420> based<00:03:19.780> mode

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
just heard was an envelope based mode

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.490 
just heard was an envelope based mode
now<00:03:20.590> I'm<00:03:20.680> going<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.860> move<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.190> sine<00:03:21.520> wave<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
now I'm going to move to a sine wave and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.540 
now I'm going to move to a sine wave and
I'm<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.740> -<00:03:23.890> I'm<00:03:24.040> going<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.220> turn<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
I'm going to - I'm going to turn the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.890 
I'm going to - I'm going to turn the
width<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.910> rate<00:03:25.090> down<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.570> I'm<00:03:25.660> going<00:03:25.840> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
width and rate down and I'm going to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:43.010 
width and rate down and I'm going to
tune<00:03:26.140> my<00:03:26.350> note<00:03:26.860> again

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.260 

now<00:03:43.770> I'm<00:03:43.860> going<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> play<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> raga<00:03:44.730> style

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
now I'm going to play like a raga style

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.150 
now I'm going to play like a raga style
in<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.750> looks<00:03:45.990> like<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.410> mixolydian<00:03:46.830> e

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
in the looks like a mixolydian e

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.960 
in the looks like a mixolydian e
mixolydian<00:03:47.940> mode<00:03:48.500> scale

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.980 

that<00:03:55.510> note<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.930> now<00:03:56.080> droning<00:03:56.590> against<00:03:57.990> what

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
that note is now droning against what

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:13.100 
that note is now droning against what
I'm<00:03:59.080> playing

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.290 

if<00:04:14.110> I<00:04:14.230> want<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.500> get<00:04:14.560> extreme<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.250> turn<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
if I want to get extreme I turn the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:26.270 
if I want to get extreme I turn the
blend<00:04:16.540> up

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.530 

so<00:04:27.280> now<00:04:27.430> I'm<00:04:27.520> going<00:04:27.670> to<00:04:27.730> go<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.030> stair<00:04:28.270> step

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
so now I'm going to go to the stair step

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.720 
so now I'm going to go to the stair step
mode<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.050> I'm<00:04:29.290> going<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.440> tune<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> ring

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
mode and I'm going to tune the ring

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:54.050 
mode and I'm going to tune the ring
modulator<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:31.210> Abby

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.640 

I'm<00:04:55.060> gonna<00:04:55.180> turn<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.479> blend<00:04:55.689> down<00:04:55.930> so<00:04:56.409> I<00:04:56.439> can

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
I'm gonna turn the blend down so I can

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.559 
I'm gonna turn the blend down so I can
play<00:04:56.800> some<00:04:57.009> chords

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:13.890 

you

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:23.840 

you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.280 

now<00:05:24.850> obviously<00:05:24.940> with<00:05:25.390> the<00:05:25.480> ring<00:05:25.630> modulator<00:05:26.050> as

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
now obviously with the ring modulator as

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.110 
now obviously with the ring modulator as
if<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:27.010> know<00:05:27.160> what<00:05:27.310> they<00:05:27.430> are<00:05:27.580> you<00:05:27.820> can<00:05:27.970> get

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
if you know what they are you can get

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.469 
if you know what they are you can get
really<00:05:28.450> extreme<00:05:28.720> sounds<00:05:29.350> with<00:05:29.470> it

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.080 

stair-stepping<00:05:34.819> two<00:05:35.819> steps<00:05:38.090> outerspace

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
stair-stepping two steps outerspace

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:56.149 
stair-stepping two steps outerspace
Tremeloes<00:05:43.159> random<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.900> if<00:05:55.710> you<00:05:55.800> wanted<00:05:56.099> to

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
Tremeloes random and if you wanted to

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.999 
Tremeloes random and if you wanted to
there's<00:05:57.120> an<00:05:57.270> expression<00:05:57.659> expression<00:05:58.469> pedal

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
there's an expression expression pedal

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.520 
there's an expression expression pedal
input<00:05:59.159> and<00:05:59.520> you<00:06:00.180> can<00:06:00.389> vary<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.379> frequency

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
input and you can vary the frequency

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.820

with a foot pedal so if you wanted to

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.490 
with a foot pedal so if you wanted to
create<00:06:04.949> some<00:06:05.189> sort<00:06:05.340> of<00:06:05.460> rhythmic<00:06:05.699> effect

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
create some sort of rhythmic effect

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.110 
create some sort of rhythmic effect
