00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
these I'm not sure if it's because they

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.090 
these I'm not sure if it's because they
kill<00:02:14.490> them<00:02:14.610> fast<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.390> only<00:02:15.540> actually

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100
