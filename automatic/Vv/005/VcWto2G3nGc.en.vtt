00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.860
 cool 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.930

 good people always put a screw 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.270
 even though this can break with vibration 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.229
 something like here has more or 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.229
 any less 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:57.169
 is a finger and a half thick between this 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.050
 iron part here is cover back there 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.690
 so we can put the cables 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.909
 here behind quietly can see 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.970
 here folks we have exits here 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.889
 We can pick up and put the source 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.560
 here the cables behind connect with 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.419
 the campaign stuff like that looks cool 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.780
 is very interesting is not that 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.280
 car mess we always see 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.419
 up here I do not know if it will to see 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.039
 mint but it has a space from here 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:32.229
 here and here until the space that 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:35.509
 People put the course down here just 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:39.080
 here's a little space for you too 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.759
 put the source is going to complete 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.550
 face down 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.469
 In this space, people also have a 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.060
 vote filter 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.069
 I do not know if I can get him out here. 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:56.419
 underneath it 's very low down here guys 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:58.250
 here made it take away but there are also staff 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.710
 the same thing you have up here has 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.620
 underneath that it protects enough 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.409
 the attack is what the source and pull here it 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.930
 pulls without dust and this improves a lot 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.779
 person who can leave the office 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.479
 getting too hot ends up giving some 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:16.430
 faults there then I think this 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:20.300
 cabinet had well 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:23.090
 interesting, well, I liked it, I 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.240
 I found it pretty well also staff 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.960
 Have fun teaching details 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:35.919
 the catcher the tiger here too 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.919
 I thought it was cool, the symbol here. 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.250
 I found it very interesting person 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.810
 I think it's cool that the sound is 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.480
 the question we managed to take the 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:49.640
 bays they yes almost problem 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:54.020
 you simply come here to near these 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:57.380
 two dredges and pulls to pass in a 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.570
 Inside road that facilitates 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.510
 enough here you already put her too 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.400
 I was already stuck here and she does not know 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.290
 I found some interesting hot people 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.920
 or doubt and buying or not this 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:12.980
 office a very good cabinet in torÃ³ 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:15.950
 here also have these exits here 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.420
 what are they for another cure and spaces 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.420
 Mangueirinha serve 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:24.050
 if someone uses it already has output right 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.060
 and also because of this I found it well 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.370
 interesting 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.360
 I think this path is well understood. 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:50.330
 he is not much car that for sure 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:52.850
 will leave I'll put another review 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.440
 there boxing staff of the other pieces of 

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:59.120
 computer that will mount and hence the 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.060
 ride him then test to see how it is 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.280
 that was in this staff is that it was worth it 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.280
 Good night to everyone, thank you.
