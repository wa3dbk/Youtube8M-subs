hey guys Jackie at the Phoenix here

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.460 
hey guys Jackie at the Phoenix here
today<00:00:05.700> we're<00:00:05.850> launching<00:00:06.000> two<00:00:06.390> new<00:00:06.420> cases<00:00:06.720> you

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
today we're launching two new cases you

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.770 
today we're launching two new cases you
might<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.710> seen<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:07.980> design<00:00:08.250> before<00:00:08.780> we

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
might have seen this design before we

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.690 
might have seen this design before we
have<00:00:09.990> our<00:00:10.290> Colossus<00:00:10.889> full<00:00:11.130> tower<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
have our Colossus full tower this is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.230 
have our Colossus full tower this is
that<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.150> our<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.509> case<00:00:13.040> pretty<00:00:14.040> large<00:00:14.280> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that was our first case pretty large we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.150 
that was our first case pretty large we
had<00:00:15.360> light<00:00:15.599> strips<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.020> side<00:00:16.320> now<00:00:17.010> we're

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
had light strips on the side now we're

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.920 
had light strips on the side now we're
launching<00:00:17.520> two<00:00:17.699> new<00:00:17.730> cases<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
launching two new cases this is the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.380 
launching two new cases this is the
Colossus<00:00:19.410> mini<00:00:19.650> ITX<00:00:20.029> Colossus<00:00:21.029> micro<00:00:21.330> ATX

Colossus mini ITX Colossus micro ATX

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.480 
Colossus mini ITX Colossus micro ATX
let's<00:00:22.170> check<00:00:22.350> them<00:00:22.470> out<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.980> why<00:00:23.340> are<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
let's check them out so why are we

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
let's check them out so why are we
launching<00:00:23.789> two<00:00:24.449> different<00:00:24.869> cases<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
launching two different cases one of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
launching two different cases one of
them<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> mini<00:00:26.460> ITX<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> them<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
them is a mini ITX one of them is a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.310 
them is a mini ITX one of them is a
micro<00:00:28.650> ATX<00:00:28.760> well<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:30.179> users<00:00:30.599> choosing<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
micro ATX well for users choosing the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.979 
micro ATX well for users choosing the
mini<00:00:31.679> ITX<00:00:31.890> route<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.390> lot<00:00:33.630> more<00:00:33.660> air

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
mini ITX route you have a lot more air

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.889 
mini ITX route you have a lot more air
cooling<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.649> water<00:00:34.950> cooling<00:00:35.309> potential<00:00:35.899> so

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
cooling or water cooling potential so

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.310 
cooling or water cooling potential so
you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.680> 120s<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> front<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.629> 120s<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
you have to 120s in the front to 120s in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.119 
you have to 120s in the front to 120s in
the<00:00:40.410> back<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:41.430> 120<00:00:41.969> or<00:00:42.149> 140<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> rear<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the back one 120 or 140 in the rear you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.240 
the back one 120 or 140 in the rear you
also<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.899> harddrive<00:00:45.899> options<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.710> five

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
also have more harddrive options so five

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.040 
also have more harddrive options so five
three<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> half<00:00:47.969> inch<00:00:48.180> drives<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.719> even<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
three and a half inch drives or even a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.819 
three and a half inch drives or even a
lot<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> SSDs<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.510> lot<00:00:52.079> more<00:00:52.230> flexibility

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
lot of SSDs so a lot more flexibility

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.590 
lot of SSDs so a lot more flexibility
with<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> mini<00:00:53.219> ITX<00:00:53.399> vertically<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.539> you're

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
with the mini ITX vertically if you're

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.779 
with the mini ITX vertically if you're
choosing<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.140> micro<00:00:55.620> ATX<00:00:55.710> version<00:00:56.340> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
choosing the micro ATX version you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.069 
choosing the micro ATX version you
probably<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.270> constraints<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.870> maybe

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
probably have constraints with maybe

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
probably have constraints with maybe
either<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> market<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.520> market<00:00:59.850> doesn't

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
either the market so your market doesn't

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.529 
either the market so your market doesn't
have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.570> lot<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:00.989> mini<00:01:01.320> ITX<00:01:01.500> ports<00:01:02.280> some<00:01:03.239> micro

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
have a lot of mini ITX ports some micro

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.310 
have a lot of mini ITX ports some micro
ATX<00:01:03.600> boards<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.589> cheaper<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:05.189> so

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
ATX boards are a lot cheaper too so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
ATX boards are a lot cheaper too so
benefits<00:01:07.320> from<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.920> nectar<00:01:08.430> ATX<00:01:08.850> boards<00:01:09.479> or

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
benefits from the nectar ATX boards or

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.200 
benefits from the nectar ATX boards or
in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> case<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:11.970> DIMM<00:01:12.180> slots

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
in the case is you got more DIMM slots

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.560 
in the case is you got more DIMM slots
for<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.720> ram<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.619> got<00:01:13.770> maybe<00:01:14.610> 32<00:01:15.180> gigs<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
for your ram so you got maybe 32 gigs of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.950 
for your ram so you got maybe 32 gigs of
ram<00:01:15.960> instead<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> 16<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.150> five<00:01:18.450> PCI

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
ram instead of 16 you also have five PCI

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.950 
ram instead of 16 you also have five PCI
slots<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.880> options<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.360> SLI<00:01:21.930> or

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
slots so now you have options for SLI or

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.620 
slots so now you have options for SLI or
crossfire<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> add<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> NIC<00:01:24.450> or

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
crossfire or if you want to add a NIC or

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
crossfire or if you want to add a NIC or
a<00:01:24.720> sound<00:01:25.080> card<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.610> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a sound card in there you got all that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.929 
a sound card in there you got all that
options<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.590> pretty<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.280> two

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
options and that pretty much is two

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.850 
options and that pretty much is two
differences<00:01:30.450> between<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.960> mini<00:01:31.140> ITX<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
differences between the mini ITX and the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
differences between the mini ITX and the
micro<00:01:32.159> ATX<00:01:32.220> case<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.420> let's<00:01:33.600> take<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> guys

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
micro ATX case so let's take you guys

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440 
micro ATX case so let's take you guys
through<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> front<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> case<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
through the front of the case now the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
through the front of the case now the
LED<00:01:36.659> technology<00:01:37.079> we're<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
LED technology we're using here is a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.460 
LED technology we're using here is a
little<00:01:39.299> bit<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:40.049> full<00:01:40.290> tower

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
little bit different from our full tower

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
little bit different from our full tower
Colossus<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:42.119> we're<00:01:42.240> calling<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
Colossus what we're calling this is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
Colossus what we're calling this is
light<00:01:43.079> track<00:01:43.320> technology<00:01:43.979> which<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.490> your

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
light track technology which is your

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170 
light track technology which is your
LEDs<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> front<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> case<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
LEDs are on the front of the case and it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.639 
LEDs are on the front of the case and it
travels<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> back<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.560> the

on<00:06:32.050> this<00:06:32.440> case<00:06:32.740> usually<00:06:33.699> there's<00:06:34.090> four<00:06:34.449> but

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
on this case usually there's four but

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.620 
on this case usually there's four but
for<00:06:35.080> some<00:06:35.319> other<00:06:35.349> boards<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:35.889> have<00:06:36.039> slots<00:06:36.630> one

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
for some other boards you have slots one

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.059 
for some other boards you have slots one
and<00:06:37.810> four<00:06:38.080> so<00:06:38.710> you<00:06:39.639> can<00:06:39.910> fit<00:06:40.509> your<00:06:40.870> top<00:06:41.620> PCI

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
and four so you can fit your top PCI

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.100 
and four so you can fit your top PCI
card<00:06:42.340> on<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.639> fourth<00:06:42.940> and<00:06:43.120> fifth<00:06:43.360> slot<00:06:43.810> of<00:06:44.020> the

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.710 
card on the fourth and fifth slot of the
case<00:06:44.430> so<00:06:45.430> that<00:06:45.610> pretty<00:06:45.819> much<00:06:45.910> wraps<00:06:46.180> up<00:06:46.419> the

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
case so that pretty much wraps up the

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.219 
case so that pretty much wraps up the
micro<00:06:47.319> ATX<00:06:47.380> version<00:06:48.130> of<00:06:48.280> bosses<00:06:49.210> so<00:06:49.930> there<00:06:50.110> you

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229
