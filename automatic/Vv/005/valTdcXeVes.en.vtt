problem<00:01:48.930> with<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.729> his<00:01:50.729> vision<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.420> quite<00:01:51.869> good

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
problem with is his vision is quite good

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.830 
problem with is his vision is quite good
but<00:01:52.860> he<00:01:53.040> can't<00:01:53.310> always<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> simple<00:01:54.450> passes

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
but he can't always do the simple passes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
but he can't always do the simple passes
he<00:01:54.990> could<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.439> really<00:01:55.740> good<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.070> long

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
he could do really really good like long

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
he could do really really good like long
passes<00:01:56.700> but<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> simple<00:01:57.210> passes<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.600> seems<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
passes but the simple passes he seems to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
passes but the simple passes he seems to
struggle<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> they're<00:01:59.130> really<00:01:59.490> slow

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
struggle with and they're really slow

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.780 
struggle with and they're really slow
kind<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.240> paste<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.520> obviously<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> weak

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
kind of paste so obviously a weak

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.630 
kind of paste so obviously a weak
footfall<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.719> skill<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.770> Moussa<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.369> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
footfall and skill what Moussa for is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.190 
footfall and skill what Moussa for is
your<00:02:05.790> high<00:02:06.030> attack<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> white<00:02:06.630> great<00:02:06.869> mid

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
your high attack and white great mid

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
your high attack and white great mid
medium<00:02:07.890> defensive<00:02:08.520> work<00:02:08.670> great<00:02:08.910> he<00:02:09.030> could

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
medium defensive work great he could

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
medium defensive work great he could
play<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.420> camp<00:02:09.660> Senate<00:02:09.989> mid<00:02:10.110> left-wing<00:02:11.069> or

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
play in camp Senate mid left-wing or

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.220 
play in camp Senate mid left-wing or
right-wing<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.180> obviously<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:12.629> versatile

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
right-wing so obviously very versatile

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.850 
right-wing so obviously very versatile
little<00:02:13.590> play

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little play

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.540 
little play

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
year 547 so it's quite small

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.220

slow for him for a simple 4 8 um 7 480
port<00:02:32.520> am<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.730> talking<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.150> 5<00:02:33.480> foot<00:02:33.630> 7<00:02:33.960> guy<00:02:34.080> and

port am I talking about 5 foot 7 guy and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.790 
port am I talking about 5 foot 7 guy and
99<00:02:35.520> stamina<00:02:36.180> he's<00:02:36.810> only<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.050> 61<00:02:37.500> strength

99 stamina he's only got 61 strength

99 stamina he's only got 61 strength
foot<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.070> obviously<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:38.760> kind<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.240> be<00:02:39.420> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
foot which obviously will kind of be a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.580 
foot which obviously will kind of be a
kind<00:02:40.230> of<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> bad<00:02:40.590> point<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.160> his<00:02:41.340> game<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
kind of a bad point in his game but the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.680 
kind of a bad point in his game but the
thing<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.400> annoys<00:02:44.670> me<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:45.090> Iniesta

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
thing that really annoys me with Iniesta

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.930 
thing that really annoys me with Iniesta
is<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.140> fact<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.470> when<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.640> he's<00:02:47.760> got<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
is the fact that when because he's got a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.430 
is the fact that when because he's got a
high<00:02:48.120> agility<00:02:48.540> he<00:02:48.660> does<00:02:48.870> seem<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.140> do<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
high agility he does seem to do the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.620 
high agility he does seem to do the
agility<00:02:49.680> touch<00:02:50.010> too<00:02:50.400> much<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.880> when<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.510> not

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
agility touch too much and when it's not

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.080 
agility touch too much and when it's not
needed<00:02:52.040> aggression<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.130> 60<00:02:53.580> attacking

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
needed aggression of 60 attacking

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.600 
needed aggression of 60 attacking
position<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.540> 89<00:02:55.020> interceptions<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.130> 68

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
position of 89 interceptions of 68

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
position of 89 interceptions of 68
efficient<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.090> 93<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.050> he's<00:02:58.140> got<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:58.500> of

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
efficient of 93 so he's got kind of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.280 
efficient of 93 so he's got kind of
all-round<00:02:59.070> stats<00:02:59.370> but<00:02:59.730> really<00:03:00.120> 500,000<00:03:01.080> coins

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
all-round stats but really 500,000 coins

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.850 
all-round stats but really 500,000 coins
for<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.070> top<00:03:02.310> rated<00:03:02.820> Iniesta<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.530> opinion

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
for the top rated Iniesta in my opinion

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.940 
for the top rated Iniesta in my opinion
I<00:03:04.980> don't<00:03:05.100> think<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:06.320> worthy<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.440> but

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I don't think that's that worthy of but

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.680 
I don't think that's that worthy of but
you<00:03:08.280> might<00:03:08.490> think<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.270> what<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.480> could<00:03:09.600> do

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
you might think so so what we could do

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.780 
you might think so so what we could do
we're<00:03:09.870> gonna<00:03:09.959> jump<00:03:10.260> into<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.130> goals<00:03:11.520> and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
but he seems he seems alright he could

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.120 
but he seems he seems alright he could
do<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> short<00:03:36.780> pass<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.170> but<00:03:37.410> it<00:03:37.530> was<00:03:37.680> still

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
do a short pass on that but it was still

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.009 
do a short pass on that but it was still
a<00:03:38.160> bit<00:03:38.430> over<00:03:38.730> here<00:03:38.880> but<00:03:39.510> hey<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.870> doesn't

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
a bit over here but hey it doesn't
really<00:03:40.200> matter<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.590> did<00:03:40.739> score<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.220> end<00:03:41.340> but

is now where it starts getting

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.180 
is now where it starts getting
interesting<00:03:51.480> he<00:03:51.810> can<00:03:52.230> his<00:03:52.620> dribbling<00:03:53.040> is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
and now it comes to kind of the things

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.920 
and now it comes to kind of the things
where<00:04:02.220> let's<00:04:02.820> see<00:04:03.030> if<00:04:03.150> he<00:04:03.269> can<00:04:03.420> really<00:04:03.660> shoot

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
where let's see if he can really shoot

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.280 
where let's see if he can really shoot
and<00:04:04.340> yes<00:04:05.340> he's<00:04:05.970> got<00:04:06.209> some<00:04:06.420> pace<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.900> must<00:04:07.110> admit

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
and yes he's got some pace I must admit

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.160 
and yes he's got some pace I must admit
and<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:08.820> comes<00:04:09.030> back<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.269> him<00:04:09.570> where<00:04:10.080> it

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
and it comes back to him where it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.289 
and it comes back to him where it
doesn't<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.650> don't<00:04:10.799> know<00:04:11.070> what<00:04:11.400> actually<00:04:11.850> no<00:04:12.030> he

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
doesn't I don't know what actually no he

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.690 
doesn't I don't know what actually no he
goes<00:04:12.540> ran<00:04:12.750> over<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.959> kick<00:04:13.230> but<00:04:13.739> he<00:04:14.250> misses<00:04:14.549> it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
goes ran over a kick but he misses it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.830 
goes ran over a kick but he misses it
well<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:14.940> won't<00:04:15.209> really<00:04:15.330> expecting<00:04:15.720> him<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
well I won't really expecting him to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.699 
well I won't really expecting him to
score<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:17.640> now<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:17.880> come<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:19.140> a<00:04:19.380> go<00:04:19.680> I

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
score that so now we come to a go I

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.400 
score that so now we come to a go I
think<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.310> one<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.820> he<00:04:21.810> seems<00:04:22.260> really

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
think this one is and he seems really

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.040 
think this one is and he seems really
really<00:04:23.010> good<00:04:23.220> oh<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> long<00:04:24.419> pass<00:04:24.660> see

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
really good oh this is a long pass see

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.260 
really good oh this is a long pass see
he<00:04:25.410> can<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.710> them<00:04:25.919> really<00:04:26.310> really<00:04:26.340> well<00:04:26.550> but

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
he can do them really really well but

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.390 
he can do them really really well but
it's<00:04:27.569> just<00:04:27.840> kind<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.139> nothing<00:04:28.919> else<00:04:29.069> you<00:04:29.220> can

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
it's just kind of nothing else you can

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.170 
it's just kind of nothing else you can

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
know if you've played with him if you

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.059 
know if you've played with him if you
have<00:04:35.940> please<00:04:36.240> leave<00:04:36.449> a<00:04:36.539> comment<00:04:36.780> like<00:04:37.770> what

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
have please leave a comment like what

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.830 
have please leave a comment like what
you<00:04:38.160> think<00:04:38.370> about<00:04:38.490> him<00:04:38.729> nice<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.539> deflection

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
you think about him nice or deflection

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.409 
you think about him nice or deflection
and<00:04:40.110> somehow<00:04:40.470> beg<00:04:40.710> rich<00:04:40.860> didn't<00:04:41.160> get<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.419> but

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
and somehow beg rich didn't get that but

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.700 
and somehow beg rich didn't get that but
he<00:04:42.539> scored<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.199> guess<00:04:43.380> that's<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.620> main

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
he scored so I guess that's the main

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.400 
he scored so I guess that's the main
thing<00:04:44.069> he<00:04:45.030> does<00:04:45.210> end<00:04:45.360> up<00:04:45.449> I<00:04:45.720> think<00:04:46.169> he's<00:04:46.289> only

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
thing he does end up I think he's only

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.249 
thing he does end up I think he's only
scored<00:04:46.800> around<00:04:47.039> 3<00:04:47.370> or<00:04:47.520> 4<00:04:47.789> for<00:04:48.060> me<00:04:48.180> in<00:04:48.360> total<00:04:49.080> so

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
scored around 3 or 4 for me in total so

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.900 
scored around 3 or 4 for me in total so
obviously<00:04:49.889> not<00:04:50.039> too<00:04:50.190> much<00:04:50.340> but<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.759> was<00:04:50.849> a

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
obviously not too much but that was a

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.550 
obviously not too much but that was a
very<00:04:51.060> nice<00:04:51.270> girl<00:04:51.569> he<00:04:51.870> has<00:04:52.110> a<00:04:52.139> really<00:04:52.380> really

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
very nice girl he has a really really

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.270 
very nice girl he has a really really
decent<00:04:52.860> long<00:04:53.280> shot<00:04:53.550> but<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.560> in<00:04:55.560> my<00:04:55.800> opinion<00:04:55.830> I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
decent long shot but I in my opinion I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.930 
decent long shot but I in my opinion I
don't<00:04:56.310> think<00:04:56.759> 500k<00:04:57.750> is<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.470> is<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:59.220> bit<00:04:59.669> over

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
don't think 500k is that is a bit over

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.290 
don't think 500k is that is a bit over
expensive<00:05:00.479> for<00:05:00.630> him<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:01.370> would<00:05:02.370> rather<00:05:03.030> have

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
expensive for him I would rather have

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.499 
expensive for him I would rather have
his<00:05:03.449> normal<00:05:03.840> one<00:05:04.020> learned<00:05:04.470> by<00:05:04.800> this<00:05:05.370> one<00:05:05.669> but<00:05:06.330> I

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
his normal one learned by this one but I

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.210 
his normal one learned by this one but I
guess<00:05:06.810> that's<00:05:07.229> my<00:05:07.470> opinion<00:05:07.680> as<00:05:07.919> some<00:05:08.099> other

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
guess that's my opinion as some other

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.210 
guess that's my opinion as some other
people<00:05:08.310> might<00:05:08.849> be<00:05:09.180> like<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.599> really<00:05:10.110> good<00:05:10.289> so

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
people might be like is really good so

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.309 
people might be like is really good so
don't<00:05:11.340> obviously<00:05:11.520> slate<00:05:11.909> me<00:05:12.030> for<00:05:12.180> that<00:05:12.330> my

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
don't obviously slate me for that my
