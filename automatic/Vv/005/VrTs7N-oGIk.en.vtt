00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
Godzilla atomic breath beam and I was

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.930 
Godzilla atomic breath beam and I was
thinking<00:00:42.330> to<00:00:42.420> myself<00:00:42.449> should<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.940> cuz

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
guys I did a Godzilla atomic breath beam

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.690 
guys I did a Godzilla atomic breath beam
I<00:01:01.789> did<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.910> one<00:01:03.120> today<00:01:04.039> it's<00:01:05.039> pretty<00:01:05.309> pretty

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so you guys can see the atomic breath

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.560 
so you guys can see the atomic breath
effect<00:01:14.539> very<00:01:15.539> very<00:01:15.990> nice<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:17.280> will<00:01:18.149> be<00:01:18.270> doing<00:01:18.420> a

effect very very nice I will be doing a
tutorial<00:01:19.440> video<00:01:19.920> how<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> Godzilla

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
tutorial video how to do a Godzilla

tutorial video how to do a Godzilla
tymek<00:01:21.270> breath<00:01:21.450> beam<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:21.990> future<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:23.399> I<00:01:23.729> did

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
tymek breath beam in the future so I did

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.219 
tymek breath beam in the future so I did
this<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.060> today<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.599> probably<00:01:24.720> took<00:01:25.020> me<00:01:25.080> about

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this one today it probably took me about

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.820 
this one today it probably took me about
30<00:01:25.709> 30<00:01:26.369> minutes<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.789> do<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.259> or<00:01:28.259> probably<00:01:28.530> 20

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
30 30 minutes to do this or probably 20

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.809 
30 30 minutes to do this or probably 20
not<00:01:29.160> sure<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:31.190> yeah<00:01:32.190> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.459> take<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.640> out

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
not sure but yeah you can take it out

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.749 
not sure but yeah you can take it out
too<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.080> know<00:01:34.410> it's<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.160> permanently

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
too so you know it's not permanently

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.460 
too so you know it's not permanently
sticked<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.289> how<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
sticked on there but this is how it

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.010 
sticked on there but this is how it
looks<00:01:37.679> when<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.330> write<00:01:39.330> oh<00:01:39.509> there's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.929> little

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
looks when you write oh there's a little

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.219 
looks when you write oh there's a little
tinfoil<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.209> the<00:01:42.209> paint<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.849> basically<00:01:45.200> had<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
tinfoil but the paint I basically had a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.809 
tinfoil but the paint I basically had a
glue<00:01:46.560> stick<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.099> to<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.489> a<00:01:47.520> glue

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
glue stick you have to have like a glue

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.850 
glue stick you have to have like a glue
stick<00:01:47.849> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.599> hot<00:01:48.780> glue<00:01:49.020> gun<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.440> need

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
stick you know a hot glue gun you need

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.339 
stick you know a hot glue gun you need
those<00:01:50.099> glue<00:01:50.399> sticks<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.910> make<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:52.080> and

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
those glue sticks to make it work and

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.870 
those glue sticks to make it work and
then<00:01:53.569> so<00:01:54.569> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> Spyro<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.649> down<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.670> make

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
then so you know Spyro it down it make

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.279 
then so you know Spyro it down it make
it<00:01:57.000> look<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.209> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.479> spar<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.989> like<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
it look like you know spar was like you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.139 
it look like you know spar was like you
know<00:01:58.380> his<00:01:58.590> atomic<00:01:58.890> breast<00:01:59.220> beam<00:01:59.399> Godzilla

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
know his atomic breast beam Godzilla

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.339 
know his atomic breast beam Godzilla
make<00:02:00.660> it<00:02:00.810> look<00:02:00.929> like<00:02:02.420> what<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.140> have

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
make it look like what you know I have

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.779 
make it look like what you know I have
no<00:02:04.470> idea<00:02:04.679> how<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> say<00:02:05.039> it<00:02:05.099> but<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> actually

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
got to make sure I'll make a tutorial

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720 
got to make sure I'll make a tutorial
video<00:02:10.440> in<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> future<00:02:11.009> how<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.520> guy's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
video in the future how to do this guy's

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.390 
video in the future how to do this guy's
don't<00:02:12.120> worry<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.290> yeah<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.069> got

don't worry so yeah I really got
inspired<00:02:14.520> by<00:02:14.879> atomic<00:02:15.360> atomic<00:02:16.110> Rex<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:18.360> made

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
inspired by atomic atomic Rex and I made

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.400 
inspired by atomic atomic Rex and I made
a<00:02:18.629> Godzilla<00:02:19.170> Tomic<00:02:19.530> breath<00:02:19.709> beam<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.989> it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
a Godzilla Tomic breath beam and it's it
