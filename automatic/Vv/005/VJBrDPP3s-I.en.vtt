00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710 

and<00:01:45.310> again<00:01:45.549> it's<00:01:45.670> important<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.299> dress<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.630> all

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
around but it's most important obviously

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.569 
around but it's most important obviously
to<00:01:49.479> get<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:49.810> in<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:49.960> cavity<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:51.159> then<00:01:51.340> some

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
to get it in the cavity so then some
