00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
of these are my first choices because it

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.960 
of these are my first choices because it
has<00:01:55.959> over<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:58.360> type<00:01:58.659> of<00:01:58.689> weakness<00:01:59.259> here<00:01:59.970> the

military<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.569> really<00:02:01.869> nice<00:02:03.299> long<00:02:04.299> reach<00:02:04.770> do

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
military is a really nice long reach do

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.690 
military is a really nice long reach do
it<00:02:05.920> all<00:02:06.099> folder<00:02:06.670> but<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:09.130> downside<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it all folder but the downside is that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.280 
it all folder but the downside is that
the<00:02:10.420> tip<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.989> too<00:02:11.890> thin<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.900> her<00:02:14.079> use

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the tip is too thin and for her use

the tip is too thin and for her use
folder<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:16.110> will<00:02:17.110> probably<00:02:17.380> break<00:02:17.860> if<00:02:18.310> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
folder this will probably break if you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.330 
folder this will probably break if you
do<00:02:19.090> some<00:02:19.420> even<00:02:20.290> light<00:02:20.560> prying<00:02:22.049> so<00:02:23.340> these

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
do some even light prying so these

we're with resistant and also the edge
holding<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:16.979> if<00:06:17.729> I'm<00:06:17.909> gonna<00:06:18.649> choose<00:06:19.649> one

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
holding so if I'm gonna choose one

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.309 
holding so if I'm gonna choose one
folder<00:06:20.809> and<00:06:21.809> just<00:06:21.869> to<00:06:22.319> use<00:06:22.499> it<00:06:22.679> for<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:22.979> flavor

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
folder and just to use it for the flavor

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:28.249 
folder and just to use it for the flavor
for<00:06:25.319> the<00:06:25.409> rest<00:06:25.619> of<00:06:25.740> my<00:06:25.949> life<00:06:26.929> this<00:06:27.929> probably

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
for the rest of my life this probably

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:34.219 
for the rest of my life this probably
would<00:06:28.679> be<00:06:28.860> it<00:06:29.959> okay<00:06:30.959> it<00:06:31.740> is<00:06:31.949> not<00:06:32.479> best<00:06:33.479> color

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
would be it okay it is not best color

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.259 
would be it okay it is not best color
let's<00:06:35.129> say<00:06:35.309> compared<00:06:35.789> to<00:06:36.769> other<00:06:37.769> son<00:06:38.219> it<00:06:39.059> is

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:39.269 
let's say compared to other son it is

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.989 
let's say compared to other son it is
not<00:06:39.599> the<00:06:39.629> best<00:06:40.309> it<00:06:41.309> does<00:06:41.459> not<00:06:41.639> have<00:06:41.819> the

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
not the best it does not have the

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.949 
not the best it does not have the
longest<00:06:42.240> reach<00:06:43.369> let's<00:06:44.369> say<00:06:44.999> compared<00:06:45.599> to<00:06:45.629> the

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:45.959 
longest reach let's say compared to the

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:50.149 
longest reach let's say compared to the
military<00:06:47.300> the<00:06:48.300> blade<00:06:48.689> still<00:06:49.679> is<00:06:49.949> not
