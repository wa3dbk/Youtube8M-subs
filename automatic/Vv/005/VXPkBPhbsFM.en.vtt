00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 what do they give beachgoers like they are 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome to a new video and this one 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.810
 I bring a pretty good trick to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 duplicate the cars what in 1.12 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 rich we have to do is paste what 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 which is at the exit the garage this c4 and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.820
 clarify before everything that does not work for 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 luxury cars ok and good then this 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
 car is pretty nice the truth the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 of franklin and you can do it with cars 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 so weird and all that there is and well what 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.720
 The only thing we have to do is paste 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.580
 as I told you what there are four and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.170
 our friend has to be aware 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 When you leave close session ok 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 Relocate the menu when you leave the garage 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.450
 and just blow it up reception in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 the case that we are the ones 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.239
 we want to move the car we have to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 do the same thing our friend has us 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 to be waiting outside with c4 and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.930
 just leave in close section okey 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 afe do not exploit us it 's pretty easy 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.149
 that trick and very easy and with this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140
 same trick you can go to sell it 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.239
 immediately ok but I will upload it more 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 go ahead to explain it better so that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.600
 not be too incomplete and here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 just when he comes out he explodes as 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.289
 in the closing sense as he says has been 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.940
 disconnected that and when we look for 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.050
 back wallace there is coal already what 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 only thing that we would have to do is 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 ride and enter the garage ok is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.130
 Pretty easy is the trick and the truth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.719
 It is very good and I hope you have 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 liked and you'll see by in the video 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.670
 infinite money ok is a bit difficult 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.679
 but to see what 100,000 every five 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.539
 minutes is pretty good ok 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.159
 obviously we need the help of a 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.329
 friend and obviously we are coming to the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.189
 end of the video and I hope you have them 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.020
 liked please if you liked help me 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.310
 with the like he does not know how much help from that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 although there are many says that because he asks 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.159
 like but it's to do is you're 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.929
