00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.059 
I do like doing my own acrylics at home
um<00:07:09.259> sometimes<00:07:10.259> it<00:07:10.439> haven't<00:07:10.679> done<00:07:10.799> in<00:07:10.949> a<00:07:11.009> while

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069 
um sometimes it haven't done in a while

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:13.149 
um sometimes it haven't done in a while
because<00:07:11.339> it's<00:07:11.610> really<00:07:11.909> time<00:07:12.089> consuming<00:07:12.119> and

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
because it's really time consuming and

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.829 
because it's really time consuming and
an<00:07:14.159> electric<00:07:14.579> file<00:07:14.879> is<00:07:15.209> kind<00:07:15.539> of<00:07:15.629> like<00:07:15.779> a

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:15.839 
an electric file is kind of like a

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:19.009 
an electric file is kind of like a
necessity<00:07:16.619> i<00:07:17.129> would<00:07:17.849> say<00:07:18.089> because<00:07:18.479> it<00:07:18.599> takes<00:07:18.809> a

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:19.019 
necessity i would say because it takes a

00:07:19.019 --> 00:07:21.229 
necessity i would say because it takes a
lot<00:07:19.289> of<00:07:19.319> filing<00:07:19.919> to<00:07:20.099> do<00:07:20.219> your<00:07:20.459> own<00:07:20.489> acrylic

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:21.239 
lot of filing to do your own acrylic

00:07:21.239 --> 00:07:22.969 
lot of filing to do your own acrylic
nails<00:07:21.419> and<00:07:21.599> like<00:07:21.749> shape<00:07:22.049> them<00:07:22.289> and<00:07:22.469> stuff<00:07:22.709> and

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 
nails and like shape them and stuff and

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.369 
nails and like shape them and stuff and
so<00:07:23.519> this<00:07:23.729> I<00:07:24.089> think<00:07:24.239> will<00:07:24.599> be<00:07:24.779> super<00:07:25.110> helpful

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:25.379 
so this I think will be super helpful

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:28.790
