00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
little bit different and mix it up a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030

off<00:04:24.870> since<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:27.320> was<00:04:28.320> I've<00:04:28.470> been<00:04:28.950> thinking<00:04:29.280> too

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
off since I was I've been thinking too

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.620 
off since I was I've been thinking too
maybe<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.270> do<00:04:30.420> another<00:04:30.660> part<00:04:31.080> tutorial<00:04:32.630> not

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
maybe to do another part tutorial not

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.430 
maybe to do another part tutorial not
not<00:04:34.410> so<00:04:34.860> much<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.640> kind<00:04:36.630> of<00:04:36.750> step<00:04:36.990> by<00:04:37.140> step

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
not so much a kind of step by step

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.350 
not so much a kind of step by step
instruction<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.160> guess<00:04:38.370> how<00:04:38.640> I<00:04:38.670> did<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.150> last

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
instruction I guess how I did the last

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.450 
instruction I guess how I did the last
tutorial<00:04:39.600> but<00:04:40.590> what<00:04:40.920> I'm<00:04:41.040> thinking<00:04:41.400> about

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
tutorial but what I'm thinking about

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.620 
tutorial but what I'm thinking about
doing<00:04:41.640> is<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.540> tutorial<00:04:43.250> where<00:04:44.250> I<00:04:44.610> take<00:04:45.360> footage

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
doing is a tutorial where I take footage

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.310 
doing is a tutorial where I take footage
from<00:04:45.930> pubs<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:47.090> if<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.330> people<00:04:48.930> don't<00:04:49.080> know

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
from pubs and if you people don't know

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.240 
from pubs and if you people don't know
what<00:04:49.470> publishes<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.310> is<00:04:50.520> public<00:04:50.910> games<00:04:51.300> or

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
some people who call it bugs which is

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.060 
some people who call it bugs which is

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
and and kind of breaking the footage

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.150 
and and kind of breaking the footage
down<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.850> what<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.270> was<00:05:06.450> doing<00:05:06.780> there<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.200> and

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
down of what I was doing there and and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.810 
down of what I was doing there and and
and<00:05:08.550> try<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.000> make<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.450> into<00:05:09.810> somewhat<00:05:10.410> to

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
and try to make that into somewhat to

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.550 
and try to make that into somewhat to
tutorial<00:05:11.820> type<00:05:12.090> thing<00:05:12.380> because<00:05:13.380> that's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
tutorial type thing because that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.140 
tutorial type thing because that's
really<00:05:13.710> what<00:05:14.040> it's<00:05:14.220> all<00:05:14.310> about<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.700> know<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
really what it's all about you know you

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.390 
really what it's all about you know you
practice<00:05:15.630> your<00:05:15.750> quick<00:05:15.960> scoping<00:05:16.440> learning

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
practice your quick scoping learning

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.010 
practice your quick scoping learning
quick<00:05:17.580> scoping<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.240> want<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:18.510> do<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.750> but<00:05:18.780> you

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
quick scoping you want to do it but you

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.320 
quick scoping you want to do it but you
want<00:05:19.200> to<00:05:19.260> take<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.440> online<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:20.190> maybe<00:05:20.880> maybe

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
like that also I uploaded a dual

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.640 
like that also I uploaded a dual
commentary<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.510> don't<00:05:40.200> know<00:05:40.290> what<00:05:40.410> you<00:05:40.440> guys

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650

commentary I don't know what you guys
thought<00:05:40.950> about<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.430> so<00:05:41.700> far<00:05:41.910> it's<00:05:42.090> been

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
thought about that so far it's been

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.320 
thought about that so far it's been
getting<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.510> decent<00:05:42.720> amount<00:05:42.930> of<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:43.560> far

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
getting a decent amount of you so far

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.000 
getting a decent amount of you so far
we'll<00:05:45.330> probably<00:05:45.570> do<00:05:45.810> another<00:05:45.840> one<00:05:46.380> will

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
we'll probably do another one will

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.400 
we'll probably do another one will
actually<00:05:47.430> will<00:05:47.730> be<00:05:47.880> doing<00:05:48.120> another<00:05:48.330> one<00:05:48.630> just

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
actually will be doing another one just

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.860 
actually will be doing another one just
on<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:50.040> next<00:05:50.400> commentary<00:05:51.000> we're<00:05:51.660> going<00:05:51.810> to

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
think that'd be cool if YouTube has some

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.689 
think that'd be cool if YouTube has some
kind<00:06:44.310> of<00:06:44.430> like<00:06:44.840> polling<00:06:45.840> option<00:06:46.410> or<00:06:46.699> something

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 
kind of like polling option or something

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.010 
kind of like polling option or something
