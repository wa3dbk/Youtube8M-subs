00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 for more than 30 years the Serra da Cantareira 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 receives sports practitioners for the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.120
 in love with mumbai, for example 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.130
 diversity of tracks is a real 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.290
 amusement park and renata falzoni 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.980
 Felipe Meirelles went there to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.980
 tell this story 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.449
 sierra of the cantante in the slope of 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.240
 mairiporã this one is the oldest 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.599
 bridge of montain extreme bike such river 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.449
 descent and everything started in the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.260
 90's and the first ones around here 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.600
 were 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.750
 they were motorcyclists in the cantante 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 a green geographic belt then the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.120
 people are 30 kilometers from the 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.820
 I know and we are in a visual place . 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:54.280
 equal to the saw of the mantiqueira skill 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.930
 the key but it has to have a lot of force 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.369
 it is also a complete tour because here 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.729
 we trained both open trails 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:06.820
 closed and all types of 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.770
 characteristics and techniques of 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.119
 make a well- trained downhill 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.119
 aggressive very dangerous 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 I think a lot of the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.380
 São Paulo who practice a river 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.500
 the hill itself is the cross country many 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.830
 these people here left over 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 attracting many people and became the yum 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.230
 key point of the montain bike where people 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.300
 is the cracked stone the place I think 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.640
 which is the cradle of most 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.350
 other monkey mountaineers 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.270
 it has already changed very logically along 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 the years but still trail more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.320
 used, it even receives a number 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 Huge mountain bike them both in the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.880
 Saturday mainly on Sunday with 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.190
 sure a very safe place was to see 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.510
 he is all one has been delayed by 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.830
 main roads 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.990
 so most clues that is what the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.810
 people call rescue that would be a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 exit next exit phase 1 next year 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 when one was 14 years old was 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.070
 to adapt is very good to pedal 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.440
 practice the sport motor bike team 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.260
 only those who acquila north as a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.910
 backyard for people 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.610
 independent of the bike modality that 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.500
 walks in and around so here's all the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.420
 structure if you can get started 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.880
 stop at carlos with son 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 Puppy kids to pay what they get 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.489
 want to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.670
 it's an eye for everyone it looks like 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.810
 I lived in the city and moved to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.970
 here 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.340
 After I started to bike I 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.560
 I think it's very important that we 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 to pass on this experience of preservation 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.269
 right tracks is awareness is 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.470
 Owner of all kinds of things to go through there. 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.959
 younger also 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.970
 and this passion on both wheels I think 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.330
 that we have to multiply the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.130
 simplicity and joy of people 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.130
 riding a bike is too cool
