00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.160
 who does not know that? 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.409
 because the nails are painted beautifully 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.929
 just change the color 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.519
 to see the nails and loves it 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.980
 So I have to say that I love 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.810
 to paint the nails but that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 Worst thing there is is the wait time 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.149
 The wait so that the whole dries 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.690
 I'm really waiting for at least five 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.699
 minutes and must say that the waiting 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.449
 the corrosive is what is there for me 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:42.390
 wait and wait and wait and wait but 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.850
 the result after that is still a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 blob on the nails and that's it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 what annoys me most about the nails 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 paint and therefore I have for today 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 you three methods like your nails 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.370
 let it dry faster and hope you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.370
 like the video 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.360
 then it starts already I show 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.070
 First of all, what nail polish I have 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.840
 used that is now one 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.320
 by teddy and i love him 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 I have to say the same apply 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.510
 of nail polish behind or before 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.830
 a camera is very very difficult and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.190
 you probably see that I have 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.450
 totally lubricated and complained but 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.690
 so try it yourself first 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.479
 very difficult but it should be now 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.420
 not here my nail polish will be the subject 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.320
 but that's what I have drying 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.930
 here as first method express 3 drops 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.630
 available from essens and I'm totally 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.340
 Excited about the so buy yourself 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.229
 definitely or better, have a look 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.970
 first result on it dribbles 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.460
 Just a few drops on the nails 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.800
 and wait a bit so at the most 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.990
 a minute and then oh yeah you see 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.600
 they were immediately dry so me 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 I'm totally excited and yes again 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 sorry for my nails so it's really 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.920
 not so now i have my nails 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.869
 Painted and painted again 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.149
 This time in his blue so much cheese 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.650
 really all extra for you to see that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.470
 I'm not mobile or cheating or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.260
 something else and even here it looks like disaster 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.370
 moderately from well the second method is 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.019
 for that and yes that's relatively easy for her 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 just do your hair dryer on the 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.630
 Set lowest level and press 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.420
 on the cold button so not warm 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.209
 can be filled otherwise it does not work 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.709
 and let the air blow on it 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.900
 i cant voiceover it at all 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.209
 human even if we have this here 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.120
 result and you also see that is great 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.590
 dry and a super easy thing and 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.600
 Everyone has a hairdryer at home 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.120
 So therefore you can not do anything 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.200
 I love the hair dryer and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720
 he is great 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.220
 the last variant and also here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.790
 I varnished and varnished it again 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.720
 This time with pastel and yes I just say 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.220
 Desaster pure when painting really so 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.070
 In any case, I have disgusting here 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.260
 this time the ice-cold water barg used 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.030
 and that's my personal favorite 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.160
 Variant to dry my nails 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.310
 it is a cold matter 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.070
 but it's really cool here I have 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.800
 Now just put my nails in bowl 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.840
 clean with ice cold water and you have to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.850
 Leave her at least three minutes in it 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 if not five minutes I know 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.100
 the hands are ice blocks afterwards but the 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.370
 nail polish is definitely dry the 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.260
 I guarantee you because here comes then 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.650
 The result of course you should as 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.200
 First dry your hands and voila 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.330
 because I have the result and that too 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.700
 works great and my nails are 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.010
 dry and i love this variation 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.140
 simply so the ice cold water is bat 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.390
 just super nail polish faster 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.780
 let them dry so these are my three 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.910
 tips and I have to say I am the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.040
 Third method best because they are for 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.630
 The easiest way is simply one 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.310
 bowl cold water and fill 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.400
 then your fingers or your hands in 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.800
 and it definitely works for everyone 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.390
 Tips only work with the hair dryer 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.860
 a bit difficult because you have the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.830
 company a socket and then here 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.890
 this and where I have to say that 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.630
 quick drop are really great too 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.470
 so I'm great with them 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.100
 satisfied 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.020
 but yes I think the method is 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.080
 So it's best for me to do that 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.419
 always good experiences made as a result 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.919
 easiest and everyone has it at home 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.839

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.580

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:43.300

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.009

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.669
 its been so long ago 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.039
 Well, maybe you have a click
