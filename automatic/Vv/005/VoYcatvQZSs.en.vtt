00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 I know this book holds the orders 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:17.850
 vocal seek but greet the low he 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 got drunk today we find a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 again on gta 5 but this time 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 it can be improvements and ron 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 it's not going to be a delirious video that's 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.019
 simply a tutorial or a trick 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.910
 Take it as you want me it personal 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 will I think it's a tutorial or 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 trick one I tell you honestly I 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.620
 do not know if it's going to be like that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.590
 but I found it like that then 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 suite this tutorial is going to be what so I 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.850
 think you 're going to look at title of the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.829
 video just know to get 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.199
 the helicopter 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.089
 an attacked helicopter so who 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.769
 is called the bezard I do not know if you 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.979
 know in gta iv it was already 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:01.039
 present and just going to have 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.559
 this helicopter without being spotted by the 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.049
 leather police we will do that 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 discreetly and will have everything 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.130
 simply enter buildings 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.250
 broom on the roof obviously the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.780
 we are not going to find in the sea 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.429
 and then we will go through there so I 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.689
 will switch on the quest only for that 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.350
 you can see a little bit 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.479
 the location 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 then it is here so there you have life 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.119
 from los santos good you can see on 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.649
 the map 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.899
 there is almost nothing discovered if all 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.310
 I just restarted the game and there 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.750
 I am exploring every 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.030
 nooks of ama to watch I did 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.280
 all that I was in the water I go to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.280
 foot everything in the game it's a real 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.020
 pleasure I rediscover places and 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.610
 this place is here so what is it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.259
 that it's here it's just the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.319
 database of the archives of the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.350
 government whose us and it's a 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.729
 protected building and that's why it's necessary 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.049
 do it discreetly 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.179
 so I did not have fun going there 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.530
 like crazy you know you have a 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.959
 sort of toll you're going to see it 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.940
 and I did not have fun going there 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.590
 direct rise like that since you 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.360
 can already see I do not know if we're going to 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.700
 see there you can see there are some 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.140
 tons of mud we do not see the good one 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.580
 will turn left already we have a 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.190
 toll there but there's nobody 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.420
 it seems to me in laye to nobody and does not 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 lets in also a guy beats so he 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.810
 there was nobody candy we go back we go 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.909
 be careful as could see 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.010
 these hebron fences do not see him but 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.830
 these fences and everywhere and will have to 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.540
 to return discretos could see there the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 american flag on the roof and all that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.640
 so we're not going to take any chances we're going 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.909
 simply diarrhea the car on 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.489
 the bottom side we go there football here like that 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.190
 too bad for the car but we'll go there 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.260
 go quietly enough since there is a 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.760
 keep it there and I've never tested by 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.099
 against there was downright with a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.440
 car like there but I think if we 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.680
 come back we have at least four stars so 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.330
 there record date base center in lhasa 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.640
 does not inspire too much trust 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.590
 fences we can not climb and there he 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.250
 there's just a guard ahead - so 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.460
 normally 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.020
 they are two there no he is all alone this 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.390
 we're going to do it's going to go through that's 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.690
 what I did just now 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.700
 then there is continuous var is there 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.020
 am here approaching me in a car like 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.330
 I said I do not know but I did 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.920
 approached here and no one opens this to me 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.690
 who is normal is a camera and all that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.600
 so nothing against the camera 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.130
 nobody has not rave and ben hop in 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.450
 climbing so there I was expecting to see 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.650
 at least four stars since I am 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.050
 returned to a building that is not there 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.090
 there are more and more people there when I'm there 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.810
 gone it was 7 in the middle of the night so there 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.239
 had fewer people 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.250
 already but hey it's not a building where 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.510
 we have the right of entry a generally 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.520
 it's clear and clear 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.280
 if these fences and like that it's good 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.980
 for some reason it's definitely not 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 for to go for the walk and everything 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.120
 in a car make two big banks on 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.650
 parking not far from there so here I 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.540
 am in stealth mode you can see it 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.580
 I walk slowly because I have 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.100
 I do not want to see me so here we go 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.110
 so when you are here you see the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.880
 building and if you are not blind 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.160
 you see ladders where I have 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.049
 heard a gun from satire cops and all 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.940
 armed but there is the world ah no 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.739
 it's not cops so you climb 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.000
 here and you simply go up to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.350
 the scale like these and it does not warn 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.780
 not the cops of the coup you can 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.910
 take down the helicopter way you go 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.890
 see how to access it and especially 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.900
 get the bonus bah yes the bonus 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.430
 what is a rocket launcher so 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.200
 down for the rocket launcher 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.620
 do not be too greedy 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.450
 there is only one bullet that a rocket 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.640
 so we can not and we can not 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.750
 can do almost nothing in I do not 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.430
 do not know if we go up 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.200
 the helicopter and down again if we still 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.210
 7.7 this opportunity to have a rocket 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.250
 so here it was right here then 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.650
 let's see here is sam added our 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.450
 quest that's nickel and hooper just at 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.770
 above me eh ben there is the need is 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.020
 there and then we will get it all 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.970
 simply quiet where the cops do not 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.950
 will not do anything at all I've been 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.600
 surprised when I pray them I thought 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.950
 come on it's good I'm dead they're going 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.890
 they will hear the chopper and all the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.630
 brothel and ben do you figure that no he 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.690
 hear from nothing they are deaf they are 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.590
 half- silly but hey it's us when 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.150
 even we'll be careful 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.470
 and here we are need and low 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.420
 as we are in a helicopter we will talk about 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.370
 its features as well as its 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.160
 piloting compared to 4 because yes 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.900
 we're going to compare the helicopter versus 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.040
 to 4 since this is a monkey and and 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.860
 aaron and driving unchanged in the 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.030
 driving is a lot more I find myself 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.010
 that she is much more real I want 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.960
 to say look at it there I do nothing of the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.760
 everything and the helicopter this bar a little bit in 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.170
 like to watch and I think that 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.650
 really a good thing they did 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.900
 it's going that realism on those on this 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.080
 helicopter and we'll go right away and 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.670
 ben with the features so there when 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.710
 you press x you always have the 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.440
 rocket launchers like like the previous 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.840
 episode and the noise of the queries has well 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.480
 changed listen to that when I shoot and everything 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.400
 that then it's not unlimited like the 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.230
 buzzer of gta iv attention look 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.300
 aja then there is a loading time 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.460
 watch the aja then as a calibrated and 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.230
 there's nothing so that's good 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.330
 it's going to slow down all the little ones 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.520
 little idiots there who is looking for shit 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.570
 in multiplayer it was worth braking and 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.270
 it's great fun 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.340
 then when we press xxi new 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.380
 once we have the machine gun and this 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.610
 who is good in this gta 5 I do not know 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.500
 if you see it in the video but he 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.910
 there is the point there is a point of them 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.380
 when aiming with a weapon there is the 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:32.180
 same point and what will allow us 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.730
 to aim to define a place to which 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.010
 moment we will aim or not and that's 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.640
 well since on gta iv it was a bit to 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.640
 blindly 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:45.410
 personally it was shooting needed 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:48.500
 press hard to get this step 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.360
 how to say this aim I mean 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.220
 there was no ridiculous is what it is 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.690
 I must say ridiculous and so that's it 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.010
 that's all for the tutorial I hope that 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.930
 you will have fun with this 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.419
 I do not want too much 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.770
 look for shit at the cops because 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:04.370
 on the one hand I do not have a lot of money 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.419
 have to be in the 259 dollars is going 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.910
 I need to point small 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.430
 supermarkets and armored trucks 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.640
 in any case I hope this little tutorial 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.260
 or tips you will have liked like that you 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.669
 makes the trip otherwise to have 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.140
 Rocket launcher makes you big town 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.360
 made the trip I think you're going 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.620
 finding it is no problem and 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.000
 do not hesitate to put in the 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.070
 comments what you thought 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.470
 otherwise if you liked it I count 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.669
 continue this little these little 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.140
 huts too I find other stuff 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.300
 of course if I found nothing I 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.620
 will not do any other how 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.810
 find a jet ski that will serve 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.700
 strictly nothing there is still a 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.870
 vehicle that is a little bit chéro 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.130
 search I mean it's not 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.350
 any vehicle is still 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.610
 the buzzer the machine guns and the 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.140
 Rocket launcher is always a pleasure 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.450

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.740
