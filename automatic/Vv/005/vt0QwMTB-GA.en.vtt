Reuters

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.630 

Oh

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.990 

I

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.350 

looks<00:00:29.600> like<00:00:29.750> they<00:00:29.840> didn't<00:00:30.080> finish

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.750 

I<00:00:43.560> think<00:00:44.560> we've<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.950> been<00:00:45.070> around<00:00:45.370> long

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
I think we've just been around long

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420 
I think we've just been around long
enough<00:00:45.790> to<00:00:46.180> have<00:00:46.960> opened<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.650> closed<00:00:48.040> a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
enough to have opened and closed a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.290 
enough to have opened and closed a
number<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.850> venues<00:00:49.090> in<00:00:49.450> the<00:00:49.570> world<00:00:49.750> over<00:00:50.050> time

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
number of venues in the world over time

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.820 
number of venues in the world over time
but<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.360> think<00:00:52.690> that<00:00:52.750> also<00:00:53.080> you<00:00:53.320> know<00:00:53.530> people

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
but I think that also you know people

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.680 
but I think that also you know people
expect<00:00:54.250> an<00:00:54.370> energy<00:00:54.760> pack<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.210> show<00:00:55.390> they<00:00:55.570> know

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
expect an energy pack to show they know

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.510 
expect an energy pack to show they know
what<00:00:55.840> they<00:00:56.350> get<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:56.890> band<00:00:57.190> they've

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
what they get with this band they've

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
what they get with this band they've
gotten<00:00:57.910> it<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.150> 20-plus<00:00:58.720> years<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.430> where

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
gotten it for 20-plus years and so where

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590 
gotten it for 20-plus years and so where
someone<00:01:02.590> you<00:01:02.650> can<00:01:02.800> rely<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:04.180> know<00:01:04.330> not
