00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you don't just do the math go ahead and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.790

get map now it is just has to allen

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
get map now it is just has to allen
wrench<00:00:59.250> truths<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.539> looks<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.899> our<00:01:01.050> lives

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and allen wrench fits so guessing this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.050 
and allen wrench fits so guessing this
and<00:01:03.840> our<00:01:03.899> image<00:01:05.270> and<00:01:06.350> has<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.710> latch<00:01:07.979> behold<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and our image and has a latch behold the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.200 
and our image and has a latch behold the
other<00:01:09.840> handle<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.920> think<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.460> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
other handle and that I think that just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
other handle and that I think that just
started<00:01:12.420> working<00:01:12.540> today<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.260> know<00:01:13.439> if

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

they just got loose or something like

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.960 
they just got loose or something like
that<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.580> started<00:01:17.580> working

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that but it really started working

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
that but it really started working
better<00:01:18.240> today<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.680> tight

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
better today it was really really tight

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
better today it was really really tight
on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.180> handle<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.780> real<00:01:24.990> problem

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
on the handle but the only real problem

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
on the handle but the only real problem
I<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> find<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.220> knife<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> can

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there and that was caused by one of the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.539 
there and that was caused by one of the
screws<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> handle<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:35.840> really<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.549> guess
