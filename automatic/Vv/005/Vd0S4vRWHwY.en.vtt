00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
XO shoot at the bottom so basically all

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
XO shoot at the bottom so basically all
you're<00:01:36.270> doing<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> swapping<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.049> around<00:01:37.290> now

do that for both teams and as you see
the<00:01:40.500> balance<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.369> flag<00:01:41.700> carrier<00:01:42.259> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the balance and the flag carrier it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.690 
the balance and the flag carrier it
should<00:01:43.469> be<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:44.009> different<00:01:44.430> there's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
should be a little bit different there's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.209 
should be a little bit different there's
only<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> excitability<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:47.040> could

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
only for the excitability and you could

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.039 
only for the excitability and you could
choose<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.670> classes<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.420> liking<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
then you're gonna set up the game now

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.330 
then you're gonna set up the game now
choose<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> first<00:01:52.530> class<00:01:52.860> which<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.219> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
choose the first class which is the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
choose the first class which is the
balance<00:01:53.759> class<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.719> then<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> want<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> go

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
balance class and then you want to go

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:07.639 
balance class and then you want to go
