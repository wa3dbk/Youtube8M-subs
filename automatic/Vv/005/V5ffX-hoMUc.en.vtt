what<00:01:35.540> we<00:01:35.660> see<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.259> merger<00:01:36.800> in<00:01:37.009> between<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
what we see is the merger in between the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.760 
what we see is the merger in between the
mobile<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.390> we're<00:01:38.540> using<00:01:38.750> in<00:01:38.990> our<00:01:39.080> pocket<00:01:39.560> or

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
mobile that we're using in our pocket or

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.560 
mobile that we're using in our pocket or
that<00:01:40.040> that<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:40.520> our<00:01:40.610> pocket<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.210> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
that that is in our pocket and the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.210 
that that is in our pocket and the
mobile<00:01:41.750> that<00:01:42.080> brings<00:01:42.290> us<00:01:42.470> from<00:01:42.619> eight<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:43.040> be

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
mobile that brings us from eight to be

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.800 
mobile that brings us from eight to be
so<00:01:43.550> it's<00:01:43.700> all<00:01:43.850> coming<00:01:44.180> together<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:44.660> it's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
so it's all coming together and it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.300 
so it's all coming together and it's
very<00:01:45.020> exciting<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.560> think<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.860> car<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.100> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310
