episode<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> shows<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.860> evolution<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
then that creating steps in after two

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.660 
then that creating steps in after two
pages<00:01:51.780> adds<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.320> hey<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.280> started<00:01:53.549> a

explanation text about what's happening

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
explanation text about what's happening
in<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.520> photo<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.060> like<00:02:17.240> Abraham<00:02:17.900> Simpson<00:02:18.080> got

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410

married<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.920> was<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.040> great<00:02:19.340> day<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:20.000> really

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
married it was a great day it really

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240 
married it was a great day it really
made<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.720> seem<00:02:21.020> as<00:02:21.050> if<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.530> Simpsons<00:02:21.800> had<00:02:21.980> put

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
made it seem as if the Simpsons had put

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
made it seem as if the Simpsons had put
this<00:02:22.370> together<00:02:22.640> themselves<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.380> book

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
this together themselves so the book

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.290 
this together themselves so the book
covers<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> lot<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.250> Simpsons<00:02:25.550> first<00:02:25.910> we<00:02:26.090> have

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
would do flashbacks in time but they

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.670 
would do flashbacks in time but they
weren't<00:02:38.390> my<00:02:38.510> favorite<00:02:38.959> episodes<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.500> then

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
that's been in this series but it's not

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's been in this series but it's not
like<00:02:59.570> this<00:02:59.780> book<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.380> know<00:03:00.500> after<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.890> next

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
like this book you know after the next

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.470 
like this book you know after the next
season<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.550> going<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.790> completely<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.450> of

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
season is going to be completely out of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.720 
season is going to be completely out of
date<00:03:02.900> they<00:03:03.350> really<00:03:03.620> don't<00:03:03.740> do<00:03:03.980> many<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.580> those

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
date they really don't do many of those

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.570 
date they really don't do many of those
historical<00:03:05.630> episodes<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.530> often<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.550> I

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
historical episodes that often so I

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.610 
historical episodes that often so I
think<00:03:07.880> at<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.270> point<00:03:08.390> 25<00:03:09.020> years<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.440> we've

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
think at this point 25 years in we've

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.770 
think at this point 25 years in we've
sort<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.920> established<00:03:10.180> how<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.239> Simpsons

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
sort of established how the Simpsons

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.210 
sort of established how the Simpsons
family<00:03:11.900> form<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:12.620> why<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.860> think<00:03:12.950> this

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
family form so that's why I think this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.610 
family form so that's why I think this
is<00:03:13.280> actually<00:03:13.550> worth<00:03:13.880> buying<00:03:14.150> now<00:03:14.620> because

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
is actually worth buying now because

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.650 
is actually worth buying now because
it's<00:03:15.950> not<00:03:16.160> going<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.400> go<00:03:16.550> out<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:16.880> date<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
it's not going to go out of date and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.300 
it's not going to go out of date and
very<00:03:17.900> lastly<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.320> love<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.650> way<00:03:18.739> they<00:03:18.980> ended

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310
