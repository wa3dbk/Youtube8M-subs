00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
with the with the pipes on it to make

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:23.240 
with the with the pipes on it to make
sure<00:02:50.790> I'm<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.420> neutral<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:53.239> there's<00:02:54.239> neutral

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.069 

and<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.489> obviously<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.209> sounds<00:03:25.599> quite<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.870> bit

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.369 
and so obviously that sounds quite a bit
better<00:03:26.319> than<00:03:26.500> what<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.739> did<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.840> there's<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
better than what it did so there's the

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.479 
better than what it did so there's the
date<00:03:29.769> for<00:03:30.040> part<00:03:30.310> two<00:03:30.579> of<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:31.659> super<00:03:32.019> glide<00:03:32.489> the
