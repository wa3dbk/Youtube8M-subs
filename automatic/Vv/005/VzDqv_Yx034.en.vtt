00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
pretty well the overall length of this

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.550 
pretty well the overall length of this
knife<00:02:34.880> looking<00:02:35.880> at<00:02:35.970> about<00:02:36.120> nine<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
knife looking at about nine and a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.300 
knife looking at about nine and a
quarter<00:02:37.980> inches<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:40.160> think<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.980> specs

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
quarter inches I think it's a the specs

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.570 
quarter inches I think it's a the specs
on<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.940> 27<00:02:45.510> degree<00:02:45.750> grind<00:02:46.489> for<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
on it's a it's a 27 degree grind for the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.320 
on it's a it's a 27 degree grind for the
knife<00:02:47.760> edge<00:02:48.950> it's<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.010> nice<00:02:50.190> custom<00:02:50.520> custom

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
knife edge it's a nice custom custom

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.160 
knife edge it's a nice custom custom
knife

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
knife

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.840 
knife
I<00:02:52.230> think<00:02:52.830> they<00:02:52.920> run<00:02:53.040> about<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.340> hundred<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
I think they run about a hundred and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.790 
I think they run about a hundred and
twenty<00:02:54.150> bucks<00:02:54.510> something<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.320> maybe

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
twenty bucks something like that maybe

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.640 
twenty bucks something like that maybe
cheaper<00:02:56.310> I'm<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.150> really<00:02:57.300> sure<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.870> did<00:02:58.470> pay

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
cheaper I'm not really sure I did pay

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.000 
cheaper I'm not really sure I did pay
for<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:58.980> one<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.120> not<00:03:00.239> like<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
for this one so this is not like a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
for this one so this is not like a
product<00:03:02.010> endorsement<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.790> any<00:03:02.940> way<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.450> bought

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
product endorsement in any way I bought

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.130 
product endorsement in any way I bought
this<00:03:04.440> knife<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.570> let's<00:03:06.570> run<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.959> through<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
this knife and let's run it through a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.080 
this knife and let's run it through a
couple<00:03:07.320> of<00:03:07.470> things<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:08.670> you've<00:03:08.910> seen

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
couple of things here as you've seen

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.940 
couple of things here as you've seen
earlier<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.660> just<00:03:09.690> split<00:03:10.080> up<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:10.830> some

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
earlier we just split up there's some

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.030 
earlier we just split up there's some
pretty<00:03:11.130> soft<00:03:11.400> wood<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:13.560> know<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:13.890> you've<00:03:14.010> got

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
pretty soft wood you know if you've got

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.800 
pretty soft wood you know if you've got
an<00:03:14.220> axe<00:03:14.430> use<00:03:14.700> an<00:03:14.820> axe<00:03:15.000> don't<00:03:15.300> use<00:03:15.540> your<00:03:15.660> knife

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
an axe use an axe don't use your knife

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.930 
an axe use an axe don't use your knife
for<00:03:16.050> this

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
for this

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.210 
for this
it's<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.150> demonstration<00:03:19.700> pretty<00:03:20.700> easy

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it's just demonstration pretty easy

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.800 
it's just demonstration pretty easy
here's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.310> test<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.239> give<00:03:24.450> a

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
here's a test I really like to give a

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.460 
here's a test I really like to give a
knife<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.220> solid<00:03:26.640> piece<00:03:26.790> of<00:03:27.000> hickory

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.810 

pretty<00:03:31.470> solid<00:03:31.980> it's<00:03:32.850> been<00:03:33.030> seasoned<00:03:33.450> out<00:03:33.739> hard

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.860 

so<00:03:38.820> we'll<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.150> how<00:03:39.269> they<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.420> know<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.780> gonna

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so we'll see how they I know it's gonna

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.120 
so we'll see how they I know it's gonna
take<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.110> little<00:03:40.230> while<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> go<00:03:40.739> through<00:03:40.980> this

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
take a little while to go through this

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:56.330 
take a little while to go through this
so<00:03:41.670> let's<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.030> how<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.299> does<00:03:48.500> smooth

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.370 

so<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.520> too<00:03:57.730> bad

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.970 

feather<00:04:02.380> sticking<00:04:02.800> made<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.580> video<00:04:03.880> earlier<00:04:03.910> on

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
feather sticking made a video earlier on

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.830 
feather sticking made a video earlier on
just<00:04:05.980> making<00:04:06.280> basic<00:04:06.640> feather<00:04:06.850> sticks<00:04:07.210> it's

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
just making basic feather sticks it's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.540 
just making basic feather sticks it's
pretty<00:04:08.140> sharp<00:04:08.380> knife<00:04:08.620> even<00:04:08.890> after<00:04:09.280> going

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
pretty sharp knife even after going

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.400 
pretty sharp knife even after going
through<00:04:10.680> what<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.800> just<00:04:11.950> went<00:04:12.130> through<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:14.350> I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
through what it just went through and I

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.460 
through what it just went through and I
haven't<00:04:14.680> sharpened<00:04:15.130> this<00:04:15.250> thing<00:04:15.460> yet<00:04:16.470> since

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
haven't sharpened this thing yet since

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
haven't sharpened this thing yet since
I've<00:04:17.560> gotten<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:21.660> 1095<00:04:22.660> arc<00:04:23.080> high<00:04:23.320> carbon

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
I've gotten it just 1095 arc high carbon

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.210 
I've gotten it just 1095 arc high carbon
steel

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
steel

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.670 
steel
I<00:04:24.840> think<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:25.990> Rockwell<00:04:26.440> 56<00:04:28.020> its<00:04:29.020> blued<00:04:29.320> I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
I think it's Rockwell 56 its blued I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.260 
I think it's Rockwell 56 its blued I
think<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.310> comes<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.670> about<00:04:30.880> three<00:04:31.150> different

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
think it comes in about three different

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.660 
think it comes in about three different
colors<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.380> handle<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.920> think<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.520> has<00:04:33.640> like

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
colors on the handle I think it has like

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.570 
colors on the handle I think it has like
a<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.660> one's<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.960> charcoal<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.130> think<00:04:36.460> they've

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
a this one's a charcoal I think they've

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.480 
a this one's a charcoal I think they've
got<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.760> like<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.720> tiger<00:04:37.960> stripe<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.770> maybe

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
got a like a tiger stripe and maybe

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.060 
got a like a tiger stripe and maybe
another<00:04:39.790> one<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.350> gunmetal<00:04:41.350> or<00:04:41.620> something

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
another one like gunmetal or something

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.600 
another one like gunmetal or something
not<00:04:42.280> really<00:04:42.400> sure<00:04:42.700> but<00:04:43.650> overall<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:45.580> a

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
not really sure but overall it's a

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.210 
not really sure but overall it's a
pretty<00:04:45.820> good<00:04:46.000> cool<00:04:46.330> knife<00:04:46.570> I'm<00:04:47.350> actually

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
pretty good cool knife I'm actually

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.510 
pretty good cool knife I'm actually
going<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.670> enjoy<00:04:48.790> this<00:04:49.120> thing<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.450> think

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
going to enjoy this thing I think

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.410 
going to enjoy this thing I think
especially<00:04:51.520> for<00:04:51.910> camp<00:04:52.890> cooking<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.420> general

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
especially for camp cooking and general

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.200 
especially for camp cooking and general
trap<00:04:55.990> making<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.920> type<00:04:57.100> stuff<00:04:57.250> we're<00:04:58.180> a

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
trap making that type stuff we're a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.690 
trap making that type stuff we're a
great<00:04:58.600> big<00:04:58.840> knife<00:04:58.990> like<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.500> Bush<00:04:59.710> tools<00:04:59.950> a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
great big knife like the Bush tools a

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.880 
great big knife like the Bush tools a
little<00:05:01.480> bit<00:05:01.570> harder<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.260> some<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.650> fine

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
little bit harder to do some of the fine

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.560 
little bit harder to do some of the fine
work<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.430> you<00:05:03.550> need<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.760> do<00:05:03.940> when<00:05:04.450> it's<00:05:04.540> a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
work that you need to do when it's a

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.330 
work that you need to do when it's a
little<00:05:04.630> overkill<00:05:05.260> on<00:05:05.950> some<00:05:06.490> game<00:05:07.290> but<00:05:08.340> for

little overkill on some game but for
