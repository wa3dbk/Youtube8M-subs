00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
recommend getting the hole in feel like

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.720 
recommend getting the hole in feel like
I<00:03:35.540> did<00:03:35.780> like<00:03:36.079> a<00:03:36.139> new<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.549> could

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
I did like a new because it could

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.280 
I did like a new because it could
potentially<00:03:37.970> kill<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.690> but<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.139> don't

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
potentially kill you but if you don't

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
potentially kill you but if you don't
have<00:03:39.500> any<00:03:39.709> points<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.489> don't<00:03:40.639> have<00:03:40.730> any

have any points and you don't have any
ammunition<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.810> guess<00:03:42.019> you<00:03:42.169> have<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.319> get<00:03:42.680> it

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829
