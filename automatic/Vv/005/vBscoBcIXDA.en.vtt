waiter<00:00:24.390> matches<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.650> i'm<00:00:26.219> going<00:00:26.520> to<00:00:26.579> first

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
waiter matches so i'm going to first

waiter matches so i'm going to first
start<00:00:26.880> off<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.419> momentum<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.559> force<00:00:29.399> or<00:00:29.610> speed

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:29.879 
start off with momentum a force or speed

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:32.690 
start off with momentum a force or speed
of<00:00:30.059> movement<00:00:30.529> impetus<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.770> physical<00:00:32.430> object

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.080 
of movement impetus as a physical object
or<00:00:33.210> course<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.629> events<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.000> have

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
or course of events so when you have

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.580 
or course of events so when you have
momentum<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.809> side<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.170> fight<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
momentum on your side don't fight it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
momentum on your side don't fight it
there<00:00:38.100> shouldn't<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.489> difficult<00:00:38.700> however

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
there shouldn't be difficult however

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.529 
there shouldn't be difficult however
sometimes<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> good<00:00:40.590> streak

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
sometimes when we get on a good streak

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.610 
sometimes when we get on a good streak
we<00:00:42.539> make<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.839> mistake<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> sitting<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.499> for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
we make the mistake of sitting back for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
we make the mistake of sitting back for
a<00:00:43.829> minute<00:00:43.949> and<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.519> lose<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> momentum<00:00:44.969> we

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a minute and we lose the momentum we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.509 
a minute and we lose the momentum we
stopped<00:00:46.170> moving<00:00:46.499> and<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.829> become<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.219> easier

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
stopped moving and we become an easier

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.029 
stopped moving and we become an easier
target<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.409> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> die<00:00:49.769> that's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
target and you know if you die that's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
target and you know if you die that's
obviously<00:00:50.819> going<00:00:50.909> to<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.179> away<00:00:51.359> from<00:00:51.420> your

obviously going to take away from your
momentum<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.249> true<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.429> all<00:00:53.760> game<00:00:54.059> modes

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
momentum this is true for all game modes

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.899 
momentum this is true for all game modes
however<00:00:55.679> it's<00:00:55.859> especially<00:00:56.129> relevant<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
however it's especially relevant and

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.290 
however it's especially relevant and
wager<00:00:57.059> matches<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:58.219> mainly<00:00:59.219> gun<00:00:59.609> game<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.120> one

wager matches a mainly gun game and one
in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> chamber<00:01:00.629> however<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:01.649> you're<00:01:01.800> going

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in the chamber however here you're going

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.570 
in the chamber however here you're going
to<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.100> seeing<00:01:02.370> part<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.539> two<00:01:04.170> gun<00:01:04.409> game<00:01:04.620> games

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to be seeing part of two gun game games

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.430 
to be seeing part of two gun game games
and<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.360> beginning<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.810> game<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.110> sticks<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
and the beginning the game of sticks and

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.260 
and the beginning the game of sticks and
stones<00:01:07.710> both<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.549> which<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.820> end<00:01:08.940> up<00:01:09.000> winning

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
stones both of which I end up winning

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
stones both of which I end up winning
due<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.930> gaining<00:01:10.380> momentum<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:11.190> these

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
due to my gaining momentum at these

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
due to my gaining momentum at these
particular<00:01:11.970> instances<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> games<00:01:13.760> okay

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
particular instances in the games okay

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
particular instances in the games okay
so<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.600> gun<00:01:15.780> games<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so in the gun games and both of them I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.360 
so in the gun games and both of them I
end<00:01:17.550> up<00:01:18.210> switching<00:01:18.480> between<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.680> thoroughly

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
end up switching between to thoroughly

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.820 
end up switching between to thoroughly
good<00:01:20.580> lines<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> sight<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.480> you<00:01:22.440> can<00:01:22.620> see<00:01:22.800> i

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
good lines of sight as you can see i

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.970 
good lines of sight as you can see i
switch<00:01:23.580> between<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.500> slanted<00:01:25.830> side

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
switch between this the slanted side

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.640 
switch between this the slanted side
here<00:01:26.160> down<00:01:26.370> through<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.730> building<00:01:27.120> and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
here down through this building and

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.950 
here down through this building and
after<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.710> kill<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:28.950> guy<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.780> around

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
after I kill this guy I go back around

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
after I kill this guy I go back around
the<00:01:31.140> corner<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.030> saw<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the corner you saw that I kind of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.360 
the corner you saw that I kind of
switched<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.440> forth<00:01:34.800> there<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
switched back and forth there for a

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.790 
switched back and forth there for a
little<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.230> the<00:01:37.350> same<00:01:37.560> one

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
little bit and with it was the same one

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.790 
little bit and with it was the same one
on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.690> clip<00:01:39.690> I<00:01:39.810> showed<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.230> just

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
on the other clip I showed you just just

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200 
on the other clip I showed you just just
before<00:01:41.160> this<00:01:41.280> one<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.790> can<00:01:44.910> see

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
before this one and I as you can see

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.290 
before this one and I as you can see
after<00:01:45.480> this<00:01:46.400> after<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:47.550> kill<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.150> i'm

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
after this after that kill there i'm

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.790 
after this after that kill there i'm
kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> winding<00:01:48.810> down<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.410> really<00:01:49.650> see

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
kind of winding down I don't really see

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.240 
kind of winding down I don't really see
anyone<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.370> kill<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:51.530> there<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
anyone to kill and then there and then I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
anyone to kill and then there and then I
over<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.450> side<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:54.780> there's<00:01:54.990> another

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
over on the side here there's another

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.100 
over on the side here there's another
guy<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:56.280> shooted<00:01:57.240> him<00:01:57.360> i<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.720> him<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
guy and i shooted him i get him and then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.960 
guy and i shooted him i get him and then
i<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> hitmarker<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.550> i<00:01:59.580> probably

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
i get a hitmarker and that i probably

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.920 
i get a hitmarker and that i probably
should<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.330> gone<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:00.690> after<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:02.930> take

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
should have gone down after to take

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.090 
should have gone down after to take
advantage<00:02:04.230> of<00:02:04.650> my<00:02:04.890> momentum<00:02:05.160> or<00:02:05.700> what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
advantage of my momentum or what

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.109 
advantage of my momentum or what
view<00:02:06.310> or<00:02:06.460> whatever<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.970> call<00:02:07.150> it<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.610> I

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
view or whatever you call it and I I

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.449 
view or whatever you call it and I I
think<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.140> was<00:02:11.290> kind<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.650> flaw<00:02:11.890> as<00:02:12.130> far<00:02:12.370> as

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
think that was kind of a flaw as far as

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.430 
think that was kind of a flaw as far as
hit<00:02:12.640> detection<00:02:12.790> goes<00:02:13.300> there<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.870> felt

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
hit detection goes there because I felt

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
hit detection goes there because I felt
like<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.770> hit<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.030> kind<00:02:16.239> of<00:02:16.270> messed

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
like I hit him and that kind of messed

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.320 
like I hit him and that kind of messed
up<00:02:16.600> by<00:02:16.750> momentum<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.069> then<00:02:18.790> sticks<00:02:19.150> and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
up by momentum so and then sticks and

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.320 
up by momentum so and then sticks and
stones<00:02:19.800> momentum<00:02:20.800> isn't<00:02:21.250> usually<00:02:22.209> as

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
stones momentum isn't usually as

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.900 
stones momentum isn't usually as
important<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.840> six<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.230> stones<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:24.520> as<00:02:24.760> you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
important in six and stones but as you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.000 
important in six and stones but as you
can<00:02:25.030> see<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.630> played<00:02:26.230> an<00:02:26.380> enormous<00:02:26.530> role<00:02:26.800> at

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
can see it played an enormous role at

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.320 
can see it played an enormous role at
the<00:02:27.040> beginning<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.550> game<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> get<00:02:28.209> off

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
the beginning of this game and I get off

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.970 
the beginning of this game and I get off
to<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> pretty<00:02:28.840> good<00:02:28.959> head<00:02:29.230> start<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.860> can

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
to a pretty good head start so you can

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.800 
to a pretty good head start so you can
just<00:02:30.130> watch<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.270> wrap<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
just watch this as I can wrap up the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.380 
just watch this as I can wrap up the
video<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:33.280> thing<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.580> want<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.790> make<00:02:33.940> sure<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
video one thing you want to make sure of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.570 
video one thing you want to make sure of
is<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.959> don't<00:02:35.200> superimpose<00:02:36.010> momentum

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
is that you don't superimpose momentum

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.430 
is that you don't superimpose momentum
where<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:36.910> isn't<00:02:37.060> any<00:02:37.360> say<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.410> instance

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
where there isn't any say for instance

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.650 
where there isn't any say for instance
you<00:02:38.800> get<00:02:38.980> two<00:02:39.160> kills<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.030> don't<00:02:40.209> want<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.480> just

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
you get two kills you don't want to just

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.540 
you get two kills you don't want to just
assume<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.590> you're<00:02:41.739> going<00:02:41.890> on<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> kill

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
assume that you're going on a kill

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.130 
assume that you're going on a kill
streak<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.030> you're<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.300> just<00:02:43.780> tear

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
streak and you're going to just tear

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.800 
streak and you're going to just tear
everyone<00:02:44.500> up<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.769> no<00:02:44.950> one<00:02:45.100> can<00:02:45.220> stop<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.810> it's

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
everyone up and no one can stop you it's

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.600 
everyone up and no one can stop you it's
really<00:02:47.380> easy<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.680> die<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:48.489> are

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
really easy to die if you think are

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.729 
really easy to die if you think are
invincible<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.360> no<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.660> can<00:02:49.840> touch<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.230> so

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
invincible and no one can touch you so

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.320 
invincible and no one can touch you so
from<00:02:51.190> personal<00:02:51.519> experience<00:02:52.000> that's<00:02:52.180> one

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
from personal experience that's one

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.960 
from personal experience that's one
thing<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.540> do<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.870> want<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.230> do<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.760> same

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
thing you do not want to do the same

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.610 
thing you do not want to do the same
goes<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.540> one<00:02:55.690> someone<00:02:55.989> else<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.260> going<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
goes for one someone else is going on a

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.039 
goes for one someone else is going on a
kill<00:02:56.890> streak<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.340> don't<00:02:57.519> want<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.780> brush

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
kill streak you don't want to just brush

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.840 
kill streak you don't want to just brush
at<00:02:59.319> them<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.709> hope<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.580> take<00:03:00.700> them

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
at them and hope that you can take them

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.160 
at them and hope that you can take them
out<00:03:01.000> because<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.299> chances<00:03:01.450> are<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.989> they<00:03:02.140> have

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
out because the chances are if they have

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.960 
out because the chances are if they have
momentum<00:03:02.470> on<00:03:02.709> their<00:03:02.830> side<00:03:02.890> they're<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.880> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
momentum on their side they're going to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.699 
momentum on their side they're going to
win<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> battle<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.959> want<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.410> kind

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
win the battle so you want to just kind

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.070 
win the battle so you want to just kind
of<00:03:05.739> sit<00:03:06.040> back<00:03:06.069> play<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.850> safe<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.299> take<00:03:07.930> them

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
of sit back play it safe and take them

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.440 
of sit back play it safe and take them
out<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.260> disrupt<00:03:08.739> their<00:03:08.890> momentum<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:10.120> that's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
out and disrupt their momentum so that's

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.759 
out and disrupt their momentum so that's
about<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.750> end<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> video<00:03:11.110> I<00:03:11.410> hope<00:03:11.709> you

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
about the end of the video I hope you

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.440 
about the end of the video I hope you
guys<00:03:12.040> enjoyed<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.880> use<00:03:13.090> momentum

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
guys enjoyed it and can use momentum

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.920 
guys enjoyed it and can use momentum
more<00:03:13.930> effectively<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.590> your<00:03:14.890> advantage<00:03:15.220> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
more effectively to your advantage and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.080 
more effectively to your advantage and
this<00:03:16.930> has<00:03:17.170> been<00:03:17.290> syndrome<00:03:17.709> 2009<00:03:18.310> or<00:03:18.549> Michael

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
this has been syndrome 2009 or Michael

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.640 
this has been syndrome 2009 or Michael
and<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.570> hopes<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.900> see<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.140> guys<00:03:20.290> next<00:03:20.440> time
