00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then a heavy weight for the winter cold

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
then a heavy weight for the winter cold
months<00:00:33.180> or<00:00:33.300> they'll<00:00:33.809> use<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> same<00:00:34.590> blanket

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
months or they'll use the same blanket

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.000 
months or they'll use the same blanket
and<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.390> add<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> liner<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and just add a liner this is just a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
and just add a liner this is just a
fleece<00:00:38.340> liner<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.239> breathable<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
fleece liner so that it's breathable and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
fleece liner so that it's breathable and
then<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> put<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.640> on

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
then what we would do is put this on

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.930 
then what we would do is put this on
first

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
first

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.190 
first
so<00:00:44.940> we'll<00:00:45.090> put<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.360> our<00:00:45.510> fleece<00:00:45.809> liner<00:00:46.140> first

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
so we'll put on our fleece liner first

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.639 
so we'll put on our fleece liner first
and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:49.620> we'll<00:00:49.890> secure<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.730> fasten<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
and then we'll secure it and fasten it

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
and then we'll secure it and fasten it
and<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.699> two<00:00:54.000> crisscross

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
and this is just got the two crisscross

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080

surgical zon this blanket and the open

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.680 
surgical zon this blanket and the open
front<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> we'll<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.120> liner<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
front so we'll put a liner on now you

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
front so we'll put a liner on now you
say<00:01:01.140> why<00:01:01.350> would<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> need<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.800> add<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> liner<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
say why would I need to add a liner and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
say why would I need to add a liner and
that<00:01:03.180> would<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> temperatures<00:01:04.890> get

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that would be when the temperatures get

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.490 
that would be when the temperatures get
colder<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.420> blanket<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.900> rated<00:01:07.260> for

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
colder then your blanket is rated for

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
colder then your blanket is rated for
you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> liner<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.180> extra<00:01:09.600> warmth

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you can put a liner on for extra warmth

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070 
you can put a liner on for extra warmth
so<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.159> depends<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.360> most<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:12.960> do

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so it just depends and most people do

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.010 
so it just depends and most people do
have<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.290> liner<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.100> home<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.450> milder

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
have a liner at home for the milder

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
have a liner at home for the milder
temperatures<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.100> we're<00:01:17.250> going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.610> on

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
temperatures so we're going to put on

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.840 
temperatures so we're going to put on
our<00:01:18.060> fleece<00:01:18.799> liner<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:20.250> let<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.640> secure

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
our fleece liner first let me secure

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.390

this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.650 

I<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.930> move<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.320> straps<00:01:29.710> down<00:01:30.010> so<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.660> they

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
I just move the straps down so that they

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.540 
I just move the straps down so that they
fit<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.080> horse<00:01:32.230> comfortably<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:36.340> we'll

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
fit the horse comfortably and then we'll

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.550 
fit the horse comfortably and then we'll
just<00:01:36.760> put<00:01:37.000> our<00:01:37.060> regular<00:01:37.720> blanket<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.230> over<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
top of it so that way you would just

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.720

have<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:41.050> blanket<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:41.800> then<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:41.950> liner<00:01:42.250> instead

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
temperatures in your area then we would

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.980 
temperatures in your area then we would
just<00:02:06.610> put<00:02:06.940> on<00:02:07.030> our<00:02:07.270> boat<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.720> over<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
just put on our boat you get over the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.340 
just put on our boat you get over the
top<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.320> that<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.940> we've<00:02:10.119> added<00:02:10.330> extra<00:02:10.990> warmth

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
top of that and we've added extra warmth

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.140 
top of that and we've added extra warmth
to<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> blanket<00:02:11.980> we<00:02:12.070> already<00:02:12.430> have<00:02:12.640> without

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
to the blanket we already have without

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.180 
to the blanket we already have without
having<00:02:13.209> to<00:02:13.540> purchase<00:02:13.810> another<00:02:14.350> full-size

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
having to purchase another full-size

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.420 
having to purchase another full-size
winter<00:02:15.820> blanket<00:02:16.740> your<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:17.950> we<00:02:18.040> secure

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
winter blanket your and then we secure

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.140 
winter blanket your and then we secure
that<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.100> guess<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.459> would<00:02:21.550> almost<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.940> like

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
that so I guess it would almost be like

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.300 
that so I guess it would almost be like
wearing<00:02:22.420> two<00:02:22.570> pairs<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.900> socks<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.530> two<00:02:23.950> shirts

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
wearing two pairs of socks or two shirts

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.730 
wearing two pairs of socks or two shirts
for<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.240> person<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.110> that's<00:02:26.290> how<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> add<00:02:26.709> a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
for a person so that's how to add a

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.110 
for a person so that's how to add a
liner<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.250> why<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.430> would<00:02:27.670> need<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.850> liner

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
liner and why you would need a liner

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.900 
liner and why you would need a liner
with<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> winter<00:02:28.660> horse<00:02:28.780> blanket
