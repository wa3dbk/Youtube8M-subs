you see them as being a big threat to
you<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.090> mind<00:01:01.329> it's<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.899> big

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
you I think in the mind it's a big

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.859 
you I think in the mind it's a big
challenge<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:03.070> finish<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.820> because<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.600> track

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
challenge to finish it because the track

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.190 
challenge to finish it because the track
is<00:01:05.189> super<00:01:06.189> hard<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.640> material<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.329> so<00:01:08.140> you

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
is super hard to the material and so you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.209 
is super hard to the material and so you
have<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.560> finish<00:01:08.770> first<00:01:09.189> but<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.829> a<00:01:11.860> speed

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219
