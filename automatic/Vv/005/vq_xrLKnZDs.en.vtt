00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
gonna continue on from my quest luck
that<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> had<00:00:36.180> already<00:00:36.420> finished<00:00:36.750> off<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that I had already finished off and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.850 
that I had already finished off and
there's<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.640> few<00:00:38.969> new<00:00:39.000> features<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.469> you'll<00:00:40.770> be

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
there's a few new features but you'll be

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.970 
there's a few new features but you'll be
able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.460> see<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
able to see in this game that you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.709 
able to see in this game that you
wouldn't<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.340> able<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> regular<00:00:45.480> one

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
wouldn't be able to see in a regular one

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.340 
wouldn't be able to see in a regular one
so<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:48.059> good<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
so I think that's also a good thing to
do<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> show<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> guys<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> things
