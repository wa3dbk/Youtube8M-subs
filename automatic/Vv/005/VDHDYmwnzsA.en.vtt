also to my TBR video basically it's a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.589 
also to my TBR video basically it's a
read-a-thon<00:00:11.130> that's<00:00:11.580> hosted<00:00:12.000> on<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> blog<00:00:12.420> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
read-a-thon that's hosted on a blog and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.999 
read-a-thon that's hosted on a blog and
it's<00:00:12.809> really<00:00:12.960> low<00:00:13.170> pressure<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> aim<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
it's really low pressure and the aim is

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's really low pressure and the aim is
to<00:00:14.340> read<00:00:14.460> more<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.969> usually<00:00:15.120> would

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
to read more than you usually would

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.599 
to read more than you usually would
which<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.929> definitely<00:00:16.410> did<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> had<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> lot

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
which I definitely did and it had a lot

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.550 
which I definitely did and it had a lot
of<00:00:17.640> fun<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.119> did<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> couple<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> challenges

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
of fun I did a couple of the challenges

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.380 
of fun I did a couple of the challenges

the talented exists and Goodreads and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
the talented exists and Goodreads and
terrible<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.689> updating<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.199> pages

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
terrible going on and updating my pages

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.279 
terrible going on and updating my pages
takes<00:00:29.039> me<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.490> couple<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.240> days<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.900> update

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
takes me a couple of days to update

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
takes me a couple of days to update
normally<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.099> yeah<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.910> probably<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.450> have

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
normally so yeah you probably don't have

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
normally so yeah you probably don't have
too<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> an<00:00:34.290> idea<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.710> how<00:00:35.010> I've<00:00:35.250> done

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
too much of an idea of how I've done

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
too much of an idea of how I've done
which<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.730> probably<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
which is probably a good thing because I

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619 
which is probably a good thing because I
didn't<00:00:37.680> do<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.059> terms<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
didn't do all that well in terms of

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.020 
didn't do all that well in terms of
meeting<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.350> goal<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.920> did<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> try<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
meeting my goal I did want to try and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.729 
meeting my goal I did want to try and
read<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> book<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.660> day<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:43.050> obviously<00:00:43.469> would

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
read a book a day which obviously would

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
read a book a day which obviously would
have<00:00:43.860> been<00:00:43.980> seven<00:00:44.340> books<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.969> only<00:00:45.180> managed

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
have been seven books and I only managed

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.720 
have been seven books and I only managed
to<00:00:45.629> complete<00:00:46.170> three<00:00:46.649> books<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.430> together

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
to complete three books and all together

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260 
to complete three books and all together
that<00:00:47.850> was<00:00:48.350> 923<00:00:49.350> pages<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> look<00:00:51.090> at<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that was 923 pages but when I look at it

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910 
that was 923 pages but when I look at it
like<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.110> almost<00:00:52.320> tried<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like that it's like I almost tried in a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
like that it's like I almost tried in a
thousand-page<00:00:53.460> book<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> week<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
thousand-page book in a week which is a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
thousand-page book in a week which is a
lot<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:55.829> normally<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
lot more than i would normally do and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.250 
lot more than i would normally do and
obviously<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.300> aim<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.660> read-a-thon<00:00:57.960> is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
obviously the aim of this read-a-thon is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.450 
obviously the aim of this read-a-thon is
to<00:00:58.379> read<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.739> than<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> normally<00:00:59.100> would<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to read more than you normally would and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
to read more than you normally would and
I<00:00:59.699> definitely<00:00:59.879> did<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> aim<00:01:01.199> for

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I definitely did that also the aim for

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.720 
I definitely did that also the aim for
me<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> wanted<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> read<00:01:02.309> books<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.670> would

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
me I wanted to read books that would

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
me I wanted to read books that would
inspire<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> write<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> reason<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
inspire me to write and the reason why I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.630 
inspire me to write and the reason why I
didn't<00:01:04.559> get<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.710> much<00:01:05.010> reading<00:01:05.339> done<00:01:05.489> was

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
didn't get that much reading done was

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.160 
didn't get that much reading done was
because<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> lot<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> time<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.750> chose<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
because a lot of the time I chose to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
because a lot of the time I chose to
write<00:01:07.290> instead<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.520> can't<00:01:08.790> see<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.090> too

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
write instead which I can't see is too

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
write instead which I can't see is too
much<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.659> failure<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.320> honest<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
much of a failure to be honest I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
much of a failure to be honest I
definitely<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> try<00:01:11.790> another<00:01:11.880> readathon

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
definitely want to try another readathon

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.820 
definitely want to try another readathon
like<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.900> particularly<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> summer

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
like this particularly in the summer

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
like this particularly in the summer
because<00:01:14.010> there<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.400> two<00:01:14.610> weeks<00:01:14.850> when<00:01:15.030> Jacobs

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
because there are two weeks when Jacobs

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
because there are two weeks when Jacobs
going<00:01:15.750> away<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.950> boyfriend<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.400> me<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.700> I

going away so my boyfriend on me here I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
going away so my boyfriend on me here I
won't<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.720> work<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
won't have too much work to do so I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
won't have too much work to do so I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
think I'll be able to concentrate on it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
think I'll be able to concentrate on it
a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.600> more<00:01:21.659> than<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:22.950> competitive

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
a lot more than I get so competitive

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
a lot more than I get so competitive
with<00:01:23.610> myself<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.210> stop<00:01:24.420> comparing<00:01:24.689> myself

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
with myself when I stop comparing myself

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.240 
with myself when I stop comparing myself
to<00:01:25.200> other<00:01:25.380> people<00:01:25.710> though<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> kind<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to other people though and it kind of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.649 
to other people though and it kind of
stresses<00:01:26.460> me<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.880> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.420> don't

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
stresses me out a little bit and I don't

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.910 
stresses me out a little bit and I don't
think<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.930> should<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> i<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
think it should be like that i think it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
think it should be like that i think it
should<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.430> about<00:01:29.970> fun<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.329> i'm<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.320> of

those people who just always want i'm a
bit<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.960> perfectionist<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bit of a perfectionist but it's one of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
bit of a perfectionist but it's one of
the<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:35.549> irritating<00:01:36.119> things<00:01:36.299> about<00:01:36.540> being
