risk for wildfires there today so keep a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.800 
risk for wildfires there today so keep a
lookout

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
lookout

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.690 
lookout
for<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.319> why<00:02:14.800> are<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.010> seeing<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.370> severe

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
for that why are we seeing this severe

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.370 
for that why are we seeing this severe
weather<00:02:15.819> well<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.270> has<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.599> do<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> upper

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
weather well it has to do with the upper

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.990 
weather well it has to do with the upper
air<00:02:17.620> flow<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.670> have<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.880> big<00:02:19.480> trough<00:02:20.319> digging

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
air flow we have a big trough digging

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.820 
air flow we have a big trough digging
into<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.270> eastern<00:02:22.870> half<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.319> United<00:02:23.650> States

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
into the eastern half the United States

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.710 
into the eastern half the United States
you<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.190> those<00:02:24.370> wind<00:02:25.000> markers<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.510> are

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
you see those wind markers that are

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390 
you see those wind markers that are
turning<00:02:26.020> those<00:02:26.140> shades<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.650> pink<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.010> red<00:02:27.190> we

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
turning those shades of pink and red we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.740 
turning those shades of pink and red we
know<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.670> means<00:02:27.880> those<00:02:28.060> are<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.360> stronger

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
know that means those are the stronger

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
know that means those are the stronger
winds<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.590> ahead<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.099> we're<00:02:30.550> getting

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
winds and out ahead of it we're getting

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.910 
winds and out ahead of it we're getting
a<00:02:30.880> lot<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.209> thunderstorm<00:02:32.110> development<00:02:32.170> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
a lot of thunderstorm development and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.500 
a lot of thunderstorm development and
that's<00:02:33.370> what<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.640> can<00:02:33.760> expect<00:02:33.910> today<00:02:34.300> that's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that's what we can expect today that's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.320 
that's what we can expect today that's
why<00:02:34.630> those<00:02:34.810> winds<00:02:35.200> could<00:02:35.769> be<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.250> bad<00:02:36.550> during

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
why those winds could be so bad during

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
why those winds could be so bad during
today's<00:02:37.630> severe<00:02:38.019> thunderstorms<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.890> that's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
today's severe thunderstorms and that's

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.100 
today's severe thunderstorms and that's
because<00:02:39.760> those<00:02:40.000> upper<00:02:40.360> level<00:02:40.630> winds<00:02:40.840> are

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
because those upper level winds are

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.170 
because those upper level winds are
what's<00:02:41.650> driving<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
what's driving that here are the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.210 
what's driving that here are the
forecast<00:02:43.599> models<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.140> rain<00:02:44.560> showers<00:02:45.010> this

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
