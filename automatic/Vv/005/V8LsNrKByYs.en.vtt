00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
like so now we're going to make a color

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.030 
like so now we're going to make a color
now<00:02:46.970> I'm<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.020> pull<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.200> all<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.440> way<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
now I'm going to pull it all the way and

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.810 
now I'm going to pull it all the way and
hang<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.400> together<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
hang it in together and like the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.660 
hang it in together and like the
helicopter<00:02:53.110> we're<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.320> make<00:02:54.500> by<00:02:55.310> thirst

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
helicopter we're going to make by thirst

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.040 
helicopter we're going to make by thirst
and<00:02:56.080> twist<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.320> third<00:02:57.530> off<00:02:57.709> with<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.250> curve

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
and twist the third off with the curve

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.550 
and twist the third off with the curve
like<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.290> then<00:03:01.130> divide<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.940> half

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
like so then divide this in half

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
like so then divide this in half
like<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:06.050> now<00:03:08.150> pull<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.180> self<00:03:09.510> nut<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.720> some

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
like so now pull that self nut out some

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.190 
like so now pull that self nut out some
big<00:03:10.080> bowl<00:03:10.290> softer<00:03:10.709> twist<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.400> in<00:03:11.459> half<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
big bowl softer twist it in half and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.660 
big bowl softer twist it in half and
connect<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> rotor<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.250> which<00:03:14.459> one

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
connect the rotor to that which one

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.930 
connect the rotor to that which one
reason<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.690> do<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> way<00:03:16.080> instead<00:03:16.940> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
reason we do it that way instead of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750 
reason we do it that way instead of
connecting<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.660> apps<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.010> bird<00:03:20.190> body<00:03:20.430> here

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
connecting it's apps the bird body here

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.140 
connecting it's apps the bird body here
instead<00:03:21.629> do<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.140> way<00:03:22.879> you're<00:03:23.879> able<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
instead do it this way you're able to

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.680 
instead do it this way you're able to
actually<00:03:24.390> spin<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.110> without<00:03:25.530> popping<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
