 Hello! Hello everyone, I am Gina! 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 What we want to share with you today is that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 How to remove the full makeup after the eyelashes are removed! 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
 First of all, let's fix the hair first! 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 Then ~ we use the special makeup remover for planting eyelashes to remove my eyeliner! 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Take a cotton swab and dip both ends. I usually remove makeup like this! 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.000
 Take a cotton swab, a wet cotton swab, and gently wipe the eyeliner. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 Can be removed! 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Just like this! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 OK! This way my eyeliner is unloaded! 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.000
 Then I will remove my full makeup! 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.500
 I will use this cotton pad first! 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 Then take this eye and lip makeup remover! 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 This way, we will never touch our eyelashes! 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 All right! I am uninstalled! The original shape is exposed! 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.000
 So everyone will remove makeup? 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050
 In fact, makeup removal can be very simple! 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 Gina Eyelash Channel, we will see you next time!
