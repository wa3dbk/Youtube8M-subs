really<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:36.990> about<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
really well this actually about to I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370 
really well this actually about to I
think<00:01:38.430> maybe<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.939> walmart<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> came<00:01:40.110> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
think maybe from walmart and it came in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
think maybe from walmart and it came in
a<00:01:40.530> set<00:01:40.740> right<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.340> were<00:01:41.520> like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
a set right here and these were like

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.880 
a set right here and these were like
hooked<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.030> together<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.439> makeup

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hooked up together because it's a makeup

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
hooked up together because it's a makeup
set<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
set and this is like the little I

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.980 
set and this is like the little I
thinking<00:01:46.470> all<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> train<00:01:47.220> case<00:01:47.430> name

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
thinking all this like a train case name

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.030 
thinking all this like a train case name
but<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> definitely<00:01:49.350> don't<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.740> something
