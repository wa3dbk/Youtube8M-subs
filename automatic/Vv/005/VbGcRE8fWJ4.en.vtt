distance sit and it's a process where we

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.249 
distance sit and it's a process where we
repeat<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> command<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.630> as<00:02:04.780> soon<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.110> you

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
repeat the command and as soon as you

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.319 
repeat the command and as soon as you
say<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.950> group<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.310> trainers<00:02:06.579> there

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
say this in a group of trainers there

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.350 
say this in a group of trainers there
isn't<00:02:07.689> one<00:02:07.960> who's<00:02:08.739> on<00:02:08.950> your<00:02:08.979> side<00:02:09.190> not<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.179> I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
isn't one who's on your side not one I

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.390 
isn't one who's on your side not one I
can<00:02:10.420> see<00:02:10.660> Michael<00:02:11.110> here<00:02:11.380> sitting<00:02:12.010> back<00:02:12.190> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
can see Michael here sitting back and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.670 
can see Michael here sitting back and
thinking<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.180> hear<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.780> if

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
thinking I have to hear this if

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.960 
thinking I have to hear this if
anything's<00:02:15.130> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> crock<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
anything's going to be a crock of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
anything's going to be a crock of
is<00:02:16.180> going<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> be<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.720> okay

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
is going to be this okay

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.080 
is going to be this okay
not<00:02:19.990> repeating<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> command<00:02:21.070> is<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.490> final

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
not repeating the command is the final

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.650 
not repeating the command is the final
performance<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:24.310> final<00:02:24.760> criterion<00:02:25.510> in

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
performance the final criterion in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.460 
performance the final criterion in
training<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.190> give<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.640> single<00:02:28.470> spoken

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
training is you give a single spoken

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.550 
training is you give a single spoken
verbal<00:02:30.400> command<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:31.210> a<00:02:31.360> normal<00:02:31.870> voice<00:02:31.900> with<00:02:32.530> no

you're just saying where the dog is I've

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.630 
you're just saying where the dog is I've
worked<00:02:49.810> with<00:02:49.990> her<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.770> can<00:02:50.920> stand<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.430> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
worked with her and I can stand here and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.340 
worked with her and I can stand here and

I knew Don donk donk donk well-trained
dog<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.560> step<00:03:03.520> back<00:03:03.760> here<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.360> I'm<00:03:05.170> filming

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
dog I step back here and I'm filming

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.400 
dog I step back here and I'm filming
this<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.130> scoring<00:03:07.410> response

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
this and I'm scoring response

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.710 
this and I'm scoring response
reliability<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.580> each<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> six<00:03:10.270> position

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
reliability for each of the six position

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.620 
reliability for each of the six position
changes<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:12.280> I'm<00:03:12.340> randomizing<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.360> ask

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
changes so I'm randomizing what I ask

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.070 
changes so I'm randomizing what I ask
her

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
her

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.350 
her
and<00:03:14.440> afterwards<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.920> go<00:03:15.130> through<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.520> tape<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
and afterwards I go through the tape and

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.220 
and afterwards I go through the tape and
I'm<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.780> may<00:03:16.960> go<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.730> Rover<00:03:18.730> sit<00:03:19.230> Rover
