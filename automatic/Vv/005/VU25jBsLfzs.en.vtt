00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the movie but in the beginning of the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.880 
the movie but in the beginning of the
movie<00:02:28.709> when<00:02:29.480> qui-gon<00:02:30.480> jinn<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.260> obi-wan

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
movie when qui-gon jinn and obi-wan

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.840 
movie when qui-gon jinn and obi-wan
Kenobi<00:02:32.670> comes<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.870> Trade<00:02:34.590> Federation

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
Kenobi comes to the Trade Federation

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.270 
Kenobi comes to the Trade Federation
ship<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.930> trap<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.830> what<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
ship and it's a trap so this is what the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.500 
ship and it's a trap so this is what the
traveler<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> think<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:40.459> Chancellor

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
traveler and I think that Chancellor

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.170 
traveler and I think that Chancellor
Palpatine<00:02:42.510> travels<00:02:43.050> in<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.650> one<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.180> cruise

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
Palpatine travels in this one I cruise

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.240 
Palpatine travels in this one I cruise
like<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.140> end<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.739> movie<00:02:46.890> too

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
like this in the end of the movie too

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.580 
like this in the end of the movie too
when<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.610> comes<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.000> says<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> Republic

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
when it comes and says that the Republic

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.160 
when it comes and says that the Republic
will<00:02:49.620> protect<00:02:50.220> them<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:50.700> yeah<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.780> think<00:02:51.810> it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
will protect them so yeah I think it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.670 
will protect them so yeah I think it
looks<00:02:52.410> real<00:02:52.650> nice<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.530> actually

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
looks real nice it and we can actually

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.720 
looks real nice it and we can actually
just<00:02:56.250> do<00:02:56.579> an<00:02:56.730> extra<00:02:57.090> thing<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:57.660> compare<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.230> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just do an extra thing to compare it to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.380 
just do an extra thing to compare it to
refrigerate<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.090> think<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:02.030> kind<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.180> good

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
refrigerate I think it's kind of good

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.280 
refrigerate I think it's kind of good
