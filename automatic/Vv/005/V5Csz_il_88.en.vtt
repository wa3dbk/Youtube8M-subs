this is where you plug it in that is the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.930 
this is where you plug it in that is the
USB<00:03:17.609> oh<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:20.160> microns<00:03:20.609> mini<00:03:20.940> USB<00:03:21.319> but<00:03:22.319> um

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
USB oh it's not microns mini USB but um

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.229 
USB oh it's not microns mini USB but um
that's<00:03:23.940> cool<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:26.239> lock

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
that's cool and then you have a lock

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.599 
that's cool and then you have a lock
switch<00:03:27.600> here<00:03:30.920> not<00:03:31.920> quite<00:03:32.069> sure<00:03:32.160> what<00:03:32.489> that's

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
switch here not quite sure what that's

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:38.180 
switch here not quite sure what that's
for<00:03:36.049> maybe<00:03:37.049> if<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.230> look<00:03:37.410> at<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.650> instruction

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
for maybe if I look at that instruction

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.710 
for maybe if I look at that instruction
it'll<00:03:38.370> tell<00:03:38.670> me<00:03:40.519> it's<00:03:41.519> probably<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.269> people
