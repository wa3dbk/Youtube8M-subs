00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
for a red-eared slider turtle so listen

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.789 
for a red-eared slider turtle so listen
carefully<00:00:06.390> because<00:00:06.779> all<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.470> is<00:00:07.620> going

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
carefully because all of this is going

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.910 
carefully because all of this is going
to<00:00:07.919> be<00:00:08.010> under<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> minute<00:00:08.700> long<00:00:09.110> okay<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.590> size

to be under a minute long okay the size
of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> tank<00:00:11.580> needs<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.480> be<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> 40<00:00:13.230> gallon

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.480 
of the tank needs to be a 40 gallon
minimum<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.150> only<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.020> 40<00:00:16.379> gallon<00:00:16.800> size

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.089 
style known as the breeder series I
would<00:00:23.189> advise<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> 55<00:00:24.420> gallon<00:00:24.660> tank<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
would advise a 55 gallon tank but at the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
would advise a 55 gallon tank but at the
bare<00:00:26.369> minimum<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.570> 40<00:00:28.080> gallon

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
bare minimum you can get a 40 gallon

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.319 
bare minimum you can get a 40 gallon
breeder<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.490> longer<00:00:29.970> style<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.529> 40s

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329

substrate<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.960> need<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.730> find<00:00:35.730> rocks<00:00:36.170> that

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
substrate you need to find rocks that

substrate you need to find rocks that
and<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> substrate<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and just so you know a substrate is the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.069 
and just so you know a substrate is the
tank<00:00:40.469> lining<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> goes<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> bottom<00:00:42.079> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
tank lining that goes on the bottom you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.290 
tank lining that goes on the bottom you
don't<00:00:43.260> necessarily<00:00:43.469> need<00:00:44.070> one<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.640> aquarium

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
don't necessarily need one an aquarium

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.060 
don't necessarily need one an aquarium
will<00:00:45.420> stay<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> lot<00:00:45.780> cleaner<00:00:46.110> without<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.710> but

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
will stay a lot cleaner without them but

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
will stay a lot cleaner without them but
if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> use

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
if you do so you're going to want to use

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
if you do so you're going to want to use
rocks<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:50.879> large<00:00:51.239> enough<00:00:51.600> for<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
rocks that are large enough for the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.389 
rocks that are large enough for the
turtle<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.550> able<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> eat<00:00:54.180> um<00:00:55.399> next

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
turtle not to be able to eat um next

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.420 
turtle not to be able to eat um next
you're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> need<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.449> UVB<00:00:58.289> light<00:00:58.980> setup

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
you're going to need a UVB light setup

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.090 
you're going to need a UVB light setup
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.000> uh<00:01:00.030> basically<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.100> replicating

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this is uh basically just replicating

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.789 
this is uh basically just replicating
real<00:01:02.910> sunlight<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:04.019> Turtles<00:01:04.290> need<00:01:04.650> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
real sunlight because Turtles need this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.340 
real sunlight because Turtles need this
for<00:01:05.040> their<00:01:05.220> skin<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.479> absorb<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
for their skin and they absorb it and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.490 
for their skin and they absorb it and
you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.549> further<00:01:08.970> research<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
you can further research that but it's a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
you can further research that but it's a
huge<00:01:10.830> deal<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:11.909> 10<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> 12<00:01:12.659> hours

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
huge deal and they need 10 to 12 hours

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.580 
huge deal and they need 10 to 12 hours
of<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.680> direct<00:01:14.330> available<00:01:15.330> sunlight<00:01:15.630> every

single day um the basking area under the
light<00:01:20.909> needs<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.479> around<00:01:21.750> 75<00:01:22.350> degrees

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
light needs to be around 75 degrees

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.170 
light needs to be around 75 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.970> bare<00:01:24.330> minimum<00:01:24.360> ah<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.820> water

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
Fahrenheit at bare minimum ah the water

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
Fahrenheit at bare minimum ah the water
inside<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.140> tank<00:01:28.439> needs<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> lot

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
inside of your tank needs to be a lot

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100 
inside of your tank needs to be a lot
cleaner<00:01:29.759> than<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.270> you'd<00:01:30.420> think

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
cleaner than what you'd think

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.069 
cleaner than what you'd think
I<00:01:31.340> advise<00:01:32.340> getting<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:33.150> aquarium<00:01:33.750> filter

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I advise getting an aquarium filter

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.210 
I advise getting an aquarium filter
probably<00:01:34.920> four<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> five<00:01:36.240> times<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:37.439> water

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
probably four to five times more water

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.569 
probably four to five times more water
volume<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.509> needed<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:41.310> size

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
volume than what is needed for your size

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.230 
volume than what is needed for your size
tank<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.939> when<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> go

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
tank and I say this because when you go

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880 
tank and I say this because when you go
out<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.420> buy<00:01:45.540> an<00:01:45.689> aquarium<00:01:46.229> filter<00:01:46.470> that's

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
out and buy an aquarium filter that's

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
out and buy an aquarium filter that's
designed<00:01:47.340> only<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> size<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.840> your

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
designed only for the size of your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
designed only for the size of your
aquarium<00:01:49.560> it's<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:51.060> its

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
aquarium it's it's kind of at its

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.899 
aquarium it's it's kind of at its
struggling<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.409> keep<00:01:52.619> up<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:53.280> or<00:01:53.430> less<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
struggling to keep up more or less and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.170 
struggling to keep up more or less and
if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.380> bigger<00:01:55.619> size<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> larger

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
if you go with a bigger size or a larger

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
if you go with a bigger size or a larger
volume<00:01:57.530> capacity<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> lot

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
volume capacity it's going to be a lot

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.499 
volume capacity it's going to be a lot
better<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.369> those<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.119> basics

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
better that that those are the basics

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.810 
better that that those are the basics
the<00:02:03.630> taking<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.320> setting<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.860> aquarium<00:02:05.430> for

the taking or setting up an aquarium for
