00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.040
 hello tankers their water gunners 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.920
 radio operators are a little unexpected for me 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.250
 saw because the fight is natural 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.830
 unplanned yes and I planned 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.670
 sorry for the tautology lay out to you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.290
 video with another unusual place on not 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.770
 I will speak on which world of 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.940
 tanks 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.920
 a couple of days laid out see that's who 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 have not seen yet a series of these videos link to 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.260
 playlist 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.120
 there are places for both tanks and art 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.140
 quite standard not quite normal 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.930
 see regarding this fight I tried 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.019
 skip you saw on one but light 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.110
 they have enough to draw 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.479
 it is dangerous to come in the middle 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.299
 I need to shine the light 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.570
 I make such a decision there lit up 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.830
 surprise sensor on base but at the end 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.490
 ends of the original plan 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.560
 come back meet the light light step 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.360
 it turned out very well 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.299
 not bad well and then I have my place which 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.860
 planned to occupy occupy regarding combat 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.630
 In principle, but I do not think that he 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.369
 I need comments, of course, all 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.539
 his and every shot commenting in no 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.759
 in no case am I going to 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.799
 and there’s no better summer 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.770
 music background turn on listen 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.399
 and so in general you will see hahiko 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.909
 open 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.210
 absolutely yes that is, I do not want to walk 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.070
 but the shots that were made but i would 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.420
 I did not say that they all wanted to be simple 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.579
 would say of course that they were all 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.189
 difficult but there are plenty of people 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.689
 who say this bullshit and how would you 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.619
 if you're there under the car somewhere 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.049
 bum and so on and so all nonsense 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.469
 but see see for yourself 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.509
 conclusion and simple arranged or uneasy 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.539
 somewhere someone had to because of the corpse 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.800
 tank pick out somewhere without glare 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.400
 shot differently and one more thing 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.300
 I wanted to say I didn’t take off the game right away 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.180
 screenshot 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.630
 fight, but to be honest 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.400
 I saw it yesterday yesterday I filled it up 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.230
 but I saw replays and to remove 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.410
 you screen with the number of hits 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.450
 the number of shots with a medal but 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.940
 solder for faces was poured and a link to this 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.740
 I give you a fight under the video of course but in 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.540
 Currently, the site has some problems 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.370
 gives error 500 any other replay 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.710
 which I try to open even from earlier 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.450
 flooded they also do not open in general 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.180
 some temporary problems with the site i 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 I think that later it will be possible to see to 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 what is it saying that at the moment i'm not 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.330
 I can insert a video if this screenshot 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.780
 you probably will not accept you have 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:11.670
 go see for yourself Well, actually 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.670
 and all thanks for watching so far
