00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
makes it really easy because it's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
makes it really easy because it's
highlighted<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> leave<00:01:29.369> anything<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.820> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
highlighted you leave anything out it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
highlighted you leave anything out it
guides<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> through<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.159> guess<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> ers

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
guides you through it I guess and in ers

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
guides you through it I guess and in ers
just<00:01:33.360> simplifies<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> could<00:01:34.710> spend

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
just simplifies that and I could spend

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.069 
just simplifies that and I could spend
five<00:01:35.009> minutes<00:01:35.490> doing<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.210> report<00:01:36.570> getting<00:01:36.840> back

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
five minutes doing a report getting back

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
five minutes doing a report getting back
to<00:01:37.320> running<00:01:37.590> other<00:01:37.740> calls<00:01:38.100> instead<00:01:38.549> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to running other calls instead of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
to running other calls instead of
pushing<00:01:39.299> paper<00:01:39.630> all<00:01:39.869> day<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.320> CAD<00:01:40.500> link<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pushing paper all day so the CAD link is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
pushing paper all day so the CAD link is
great<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.460> filling<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> their<00:01:42.180> information

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
great for filling in their information

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
great for filling in their information
for<00:01:43.049> us<00:01:43.200> because<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.520> adds<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
for us because it it adds in the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
for us because it it adds in the
information<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.619> might<00:01:46.920> not

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
information that we that we might not

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
information that we that we might not
have<00:01:47.070> thought<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> puts<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
have thought about and then it puts it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.420 
have thought about and then it puts it
in<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.409> takes<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> guesswork<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
in so it takes out the guesswork and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
in so it takes out the guesswork and
helps<00:01:50.670> us<00:01:50.850> move<00:01:51.360> along<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> call<00:01:51.930> faster

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
helps us move along with the call faster

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440 
helps us move along with the call faster
and<00:01:52.500> effectively<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.640> term<00:01:53.939> people<00:01:54.270> like

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and effectively the term people like

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
and effectively the term people like
uses<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.229> firefighter<00:01:55.710> proof<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
uses you know firefighter proof make it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
uses you know firefighter proof make it
easy<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> stuff<00:01:58.200> done<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
easy you know you get that stuff done so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.039 
easy you know you get that stuff done so
you<00:01:58.770> could<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.280> out<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you could go out and be you know be and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.520 
you could go out and be you know be and
trained<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> good<00:02:02.040> firefighter
