00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.100
 they executed the mode and they go 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.340
 go into sugar of duty we won with the 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.900
 mp utility

 call of duty with a new image 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.300
 would be 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.890
 and we put this 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.100
 the thing in this way is that it changes the 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:02.510
 fire war mode 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.840

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 call of duty black ops' 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.390

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.390
 these weapons 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.680
 which are the ones that I personalize 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.950
 without more 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.800

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.489
 I hope you like the mod 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.060
 and blind like that 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.020
 the pharaoh's engine 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.760
 fragmentation grenade are all in 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.320
 mex but you have to shoot very high 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.480
 because if they throw him for example we 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.480
 we want it to get there we throw ourselves there 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.729
