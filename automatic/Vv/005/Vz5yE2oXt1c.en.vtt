00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
back to the DIY home build channel we're

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.250 
back to the DIY home build channel we're
going<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.550> embark<00:00:17.150> now<00:00:17.390> on<00:00:17.599> the<00:00:17.720> journey<00:00:17.990> of

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to embark now on the journey of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.890 
going to embark now on the journey of
creating<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.220> lazy<00:00:19.490> susan<00:00:19.640> cabinet<00:00:20.480> as<00:00:20.630> it's

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
creating this lazy susan cabinet as it's

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.200 
creating this lazy susan cabinet as it's
the<00:00:21.080> next<00:00:21.410> in<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.650> series<00:00:21.919> so<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.730> just<00:00:22.939> wanted

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
the next in the series so I just wanted

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.990 
the next in the series so I just wanted
to<00:00:23.450> point<00:00:24.320> out<00:00:24.529> something<00:00:25.099> with<00:00:25.340> respect<00:00:25.550> to

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
to point out something with respect to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.269 
to point out something with respect to
the<00:00:26.119> overall<00:00:26.419> kitchen<00:00:26.930> design<00:00:27.289> initially

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
the overall kitchen design initially

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.640 
the overall kitchen design initially
here<00:00:28.880> in<00:00:28.910> this<00:00:29.300> corner<00:00:29.720> where<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.080> lazy<00:00:30.260> susan

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
here in this corner where the lazy susan

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.630 
here in this corner where the lazy susan
is<00:00:30.980> going<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.189> go

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
is going to go

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.259 
is going to go
we<00:00:32.000> had<00:00:32.500> another<00:00:33.500> bank<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.129> four<00:00:34.460> drawers<00:00:34.879> and

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:35.269 
we had another bank of four drawers and

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.939 
we had another bank of four drawers and
at<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.510> last<00:00:35.660> minute<00:00:36.110> we<00:00:36.260> decided<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.769> make<00:00:36.920> a

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
at the last minute we decided to make a

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.540 
at the last minute we decided to make a
design<00:00:37.370> change<00:00:37.960> because<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.559> size<00:00:40.250> of

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
design change because of the size of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.700 
design change because of the size of
this<00:00:40.730> door<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.629> amount<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:42.050> space<00:00:42.230> that

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
this door and the amount of space that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.939 
this door and the amount of space that
was<00:00:42.979> behind<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:45.110> how<00:00:45.379> much<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:45.799> would

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
was behind it and how much we would

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.500 
was behind it and how much we would
probably<00:00:46.400> lose<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:46.909> we<00:00:47.059> went<00:00:47.299> ahead<00:00:47.360> and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
probably lose if we went ahead and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.119 
probably lose if we went ahead and
implemented<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.199> that<00:00:48.409> way<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.589> we<00:00:48.890> didn't

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
implemented it that way so we didn't

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.430 
implemented it that way so we didn't
want<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.369> do<00:00:49.549> that<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.449> opted<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.960> put<00:00:51.260> a

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
want to do that and we opted to put a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.700 
want to do that and we opted to put a
lazy<00:00:51.650> susan<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.489> this<00:00:53.030> corner<00:00:53.510> which<00:00:54.470> was

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
lazy susan in this corner which was

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.320 
lazy susan in this corner which was
there<00:00:54.920> originally<00:00:55.549> but<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:55.790> we're<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:56.269> to

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
there originally but now we're going to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.259 
there originally but now we're going to
make<00:00:56.510> ours<00:00:56.720> a<00:00:56.839> little<00:00:57.170> bit<00:00:57.290> bigger<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.269> the

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
make ours a little bit bigger and the

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.979 
make ours a little bit bigger and the
other<00:00:59.390> thing<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.690> would<00:00:59.750> point<00:00:59.869> out<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.320> uh<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
other thing I would point out is uh the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.020 
other thing I would point out is uh the
dimensions<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.470> side<00:01:03.949> is<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.610> little<00:01:04.909> bit

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
dimensions for this side is a little bit

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.149 
dimensions for this side is a little bit
longer<00:01:05.330> than<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.720> dimensions<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.560> this<00:01:06.860> side

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
longer than the dimensions for this side

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.660 
longer than the dimensions for this side
of<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.110> lazy<00:01:09.110> susan<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.159> that's

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
of the lazy susan and and that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.850 
of the lazy susan and and that's
partially<00:01:11.119> by<00:01:11.510> design<00:01:12.020> we<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:12.409> to<00:01:12.560> put<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
partially by design we have to put the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.590 
partially by design we have to put the
sink<00:01:13.130> where<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.490> need<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.670> put<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.060> sink<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
sink where we need to put the sink and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.029 
sink where we need to put the sink and
we<00:01:15.020> need<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.229> little<00:01:15.409> bit<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.679> counter<00:01:15.890> space

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
we need a little bit of counter space

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.389 
we need a little bit of counter space
left<00:01:16.490> over<00:01:16.789> here<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.039> normally<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.189> lazy

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
left over here so normally the lazy

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.870 
left over here so normally the lazy
susan<00:01:19.700> doors<00:01:20.060> are<00:01:20.270> created<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:21.020> way<00:01:21.049> that

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
susan doors are created in a way that

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.109 
susan doors are created in a way that
these<00:01:22.880> two<00:01:23.119> doors<00:01:23.420> are<00:01:23.659> equal<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.670> what

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
these two doors are equal and so what

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.669 
these two doors are equal and so what
we're<00:01:26.270> going<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:26.420> be<00:01:26.570> doing<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:27.229> actually

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
we're going to be doing is actually

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.279 
we're going to be doing is actually
making<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.310> left<00:01:28.640> door<00:01:28.880> slightly<00:01:29.719> larger

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
making this left door slightly larger

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.010 
making this left door slightly larger
than<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:31.399> right<00:01:31.729> door<00:01:32.060> there's<00:01:32.719> going<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:32.929> be

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
than the right door there's going to be

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.410 
than the right door there's going to be
a<00:01:33.109> bifold<00:01:33.590> hinge<00:01:34.009> that's<00:01:34.280> concealed<00:01:34.969> in<00:01:35.270> this

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
a bifold hinge that's concealed in this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.319 
a bifold hinge that's concealed in this
corner<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.469> two<00:01:36.619> doors<00:01:36.859> will<00:01:37.159> open<00:01:37.670> like

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
corner and the two doors will open like

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.719 
corner and the two doors will open like
a<00:01:38.390> bifold<00:01:38.899> door<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:39.679> a<00:01:39.710> reverse<00:01:40.039> bifold<00:01:40.579> door

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
a bifold door like a reverse bifold door

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.910 
a bifold door like a reverse bifold door
and<00:01:41.240> you'll<00:01:41.659> be<00:01:41.780> able<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.170> get<00:01:42.319> at<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.710> lazy

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
and you'll be able to get at the lazy

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.399 
and you'll be able to get at the lazy
susan<00:01:43.249> now<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.060> could<00:01:44.509> have<00:01:44.630> made<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.229> lazy

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
susan now I could have made the lazy

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.120 
susan now I could have made the lazy
susan<00:01:46.090> symmetrical<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.560> made<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.799> left<00:01:48.979> door

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
susan symmetrical and made the left door

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.919 
susan symmetrical and made the left door
equal<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.759> right<00:01:49.939> door<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.630> would<00:01:50.840> have

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
equal to the right door and I would have

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.899 
equal to the right door and I would have
had<00:01:50.960> about<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.319> six<00:01:51.619> inch<00:01:51.799> space<00:01:52.219> here<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.729> try

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
had about a six inch space here to try

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.879 
had about a six inch space here to try
to<00:01:52.969> fill<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:53.479> something<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.170> given<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
to fill with something and given the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.469 
to fill with something and given the
size<00:01:55.069> of<00:01:55.280> our<00:01:55.399> face<00:01:55.670> frames<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.299> would<00:01:56.389> have

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
size of our face frames it would have

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.239 
size of our face frames it would have
left<00:01:56.659> me<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:56.990> about<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.229> two<00:01:57.469> inch<00:01:57.499> opening

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
left me with about a two inch opening

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.969 
left me with about a two inch opening
and<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:59.030> pain<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.600> work<00:01:59.630> in<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.319> know

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and that's a pain to work in I know

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.370 
and that's a pain to work in I know
there<00:02:01.280> are<00:02:01.399> very<00:02:01.609> cool<00:02:01.909> things<00:02:02.329> like<00:02:02.569> pull-out

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
there are very cool things like pull-out

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.800 
there are very cool things like pull-out
spice<00:02:03.859> racks<00:02:04.219> and<00:02:04.579> pullout<00:02:04.939> knife<00:02:05.359> drawers

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
spice racks and pullout knife drawers

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.919 
spice racks and pullout knife drawers
and<00:02:06.200> or<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.609> little<00:02:07.969> open<00:02:08.270> door<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.750> can

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
and or a little open door that you can

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.260 
and or a little open door that you can
put<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.679> baking<00:02:10.130> sheets<00:02:10.429> into<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.120> things

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
put your baking sheets into and things

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.690 
put your baking sheets into and things
like<00:02:11.420> that<00:02:11.690> but<00:02:12.410> just<00:02:12.770> given<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> amount<00:02:13.580> of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
like that but just given the amount of

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.790 
like that but just given the amount of
overhead<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.360> creating<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> cabinet<00:02:15.620> for

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
overhead and creating that cabinet for

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.100 
overhead and creating that cabinet for
the<00:02:15.860> amount<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.280> space<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:18.050> to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
the amount of space that it's going to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.710 
the amount of space that it's going to
give<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.800> just<00:02:18.950> opted<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.700> include<00:02:20.390> that

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
give you we just opted to include that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.450 
give you we just opted to include that
space<00:02:21.170> into<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.100> lazy<00:02:22.430> susan<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.090> that's

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
space into the lazy susan and that's

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.040 
space into the lazy susan and that's
kind<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> cool<00:02:23.910> thing<00:02:24.150> about<00:02:24.180> custom<00:02:24.840> work

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
kind of the cool thing about custom work

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.040 
kind of the cool thing about custom work
is<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:26.220> know<00:02:26.340> for<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.180> much<00:02:27.660> more

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
is you know for not really much more

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.050 
is you know for not really much more
money<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.740> even<00:02:29.010> less<00:02:29.310> money<00:02:29.640> than<00:02:29.820> making

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
money or for even less money than making

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.330 
money or for even less money than making
two<00:02:30.360> different<00:02:30.690> cabinets<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.770> know<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
two different cabinets you know you can

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.850 
two different cabinets you know you can
get<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.930> custom<00:02:33.930> cabinet<00:02:34.290> built<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.740> way

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
get a custom cabinet built the way

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
get a custom cabinet built the way
exactly<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.550> way<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.720> let<00:02:37.020> me

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
exactly the way you want to so let me

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.340 
exactly the way you want to so let me
flip<00:02:37.500> over<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> lazy<00:02:38.850> susan<00:02:39.350> cabinet

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
flip over here to the lazy susan cabinet

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
flip over here to the lazy susan cabinet
because<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.680> wanted<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> point<00:02:41.250> out<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> couple

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
because I wanted to point out a couple

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.170 
because I wanted to point out a couple
things<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.450> usual<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.710> trying<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.220> lead<00:02:44.490> each

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
things as usual I'm trying to lead each

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.990 
things as usual I'm trying to lead each
new<00:02:45.750> cabinet<00:02:46.320> segment<00:02:47.220> off<00:02:47.370> with<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.730> little

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
new cabinet segment off with a little

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.210 
new cabinet segment off with a little
bit<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> discussion<00:02:48.750> on<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.960> design<00:02:49.350> I've

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
bit of discussion on the design I've

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.580 
bit of discussion on the design I've
said<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.640> before<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.510> warrants<00:02:52.260> saying

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
said this before and it warrants saying

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.950 
said this before and it warrants saying
again<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:53.460> believe<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.210> if<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.720> keep

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
again as I believe that if you can keep

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.320 
again as I believe that if you can keep
the<00:02:55.350> overall<00:02:55.860> construction<00:02:56.280> plan<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.300> your

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
the overall construction plan in your

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.180 
the overall construction plan in your
head<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.840> definitely<00:02:58.410> helps<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.770> make<00:02:58.920> better

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
head it definitely helps you make better

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
head it definitely helps you make better
decisions<00:02:59.910> down<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.690> road<00:03:00.870> when<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.200> run

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
decisions down the road when you run

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
decisions down the road when you run
into<00:03:01.590> problems<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.250> always<00:03:02.610> kind<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.910> run

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
into problems and you always kind of run

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.970 
into problems and you always kind of run
into<00:03:03.330> problems<00:03:03.750> I've<00:03:03.930> almost<00:03:04.200> never<00:03:04.440> had<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
into problems I've almost never had a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.240 
into problems I've almost never had a
job<00:03:05.400> go<00:03:06.120> exactly<00:03:06.900> how<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.350> wanted<00:03:07.830> it's<00:03:08.010> very

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
job go exactly how I wanted it's very

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.340 
job go exactly how I wanted it's very
rare<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:09.270> that's<00:03:09.450> kind<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.780> fun<00:03:09.930> part<00:03:09.990> of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
rare but that's kind of the fun part of

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.660 
rare but that's kind of the fun part of
it<00:03:10.470> too<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.950> at<00:03:11.070> those<00:03:11.220> things<00:03:11.520> as

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it too I look at those things as

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.360 
it too I look at those things as
opportunities<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.390> learn<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.650> anyway<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.130> can

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
opportunities to learn so anyway you can

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.020 
opportunities to learn so anyway you can
see<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:17.010> longer<00:03:17.610> side<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
see here that the longer side of the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.760 
see here that the longer side of the
lazy<00:03:18.330> susan<00:03:18.660> cabinet<00:03:19.320> we're<00:03:19.500> going<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> be

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
lazy susan cabinet we're going to be

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.800 
lazy susan cabinet we're going to be
absorbing<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.460> six<00:03:20.730> inches<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.300> mentioned

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
absorbing that six inches as I mentioned

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.750 
absorbing that six inches as I mentioned
I<00:03:22.020> don't<00:03:22.440> know<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:22.950> I'll<00:03:23.040> actually<00:03:23.220> put

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
I don't know that I'll actually put

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.630 
I don't know that I'll actually put
another<00:03:24.240> wall<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> might<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.520> be

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
another wall here I might just to be

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.240 
another wall here I might just to be
able<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.880> keep<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> cookie<00:03:28.770> sheets<00:03:29.040> from

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
able to keep the cookie sheets from

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.980 
able to keep the cookie sheets from
sliding<00:03:29.520> down<00:03:29.670> or<00:03:30.060> whatever<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> go

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
sliding down or whatever is going to go

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.620 
sliding down or whatever is going to go
in<00:03:31.140> here<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.440> don't<00:03:31.560> really<00:03:31.740> know<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.330> we<00:03:33.480> might

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
in here I don't really know so we might

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.120 
in here I don't really know so we might
do<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.960> we<00:03:34.110> might<00:03:34.290> not<00:03:34.440> I'll<00:03:34.650> have<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.920> see

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
do that we might not I'll have to see

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.760 
do that we might not I'll have to see
but<00:03:35.370> that's<00:03:35.460> easy<00:03:35.820> that's<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> easy<00:03:36.810> fix<00:03:37.620> to

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
but that's easy that's the easy fix to

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.370 
but that's easy that's the easy fix to
be<00:03:38.430> able<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.600> can<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.990> just<00:03:40.260> like

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
be able to do so you can see just like

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.320 
be able to do so you can see just like
in<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.680> overall<00:03:41.070> design<00:03:41.310> I've<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.120> left

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
in the overall design I've got the left

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.170 
in the overall design I've got the left
side<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.810> longer<00:03:43.260> than<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.500> right<00:03:43.680> side

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
side here longer than the right side

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.670 
side here longer than the right side
what's<00:03:45.180> different<00:03:45.570> about<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.990> cabinet<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.650> a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
what's different about this cabinet is a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.220 
what's different about this cabinet is a
couple<00:03:47.100> things<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:48.240> first<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.960> top

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
couple things the first is the top

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.600 
couple things the first is the top
obviously<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.430> it's<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.180> corner<00:03:51.630> cabinet<00:03:52.140> and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
obviously so it's a corner cabinet and

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.950 
obviously so it's a corner cabinet and
so<00:03:53.610> because<00:03:53.850> it's<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.060> corner<00:03:54.300> cabinet<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
so because it's a corner cabinet you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.310 
so because it's a corner cabinet you
need<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.590> put<00:03:55.800> in<00:03:55.920> some<00:03:56.100> additional<00:03:56.670> stretcher

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
need to put in some additional stretcher

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.630 
need to put in some additional stretcher
material<00:03:58.320> it's<00:03:58.800> not<00:03:59.040> going<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.280> be<00:03:59.400> sufficient

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
material it's not going to be sufficient

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.730 
material it's not going to be sufficient
just<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.210> have<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> little<00:04:00.570> stretcher<00:04:01.200> here<00:04:01.590> and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
just to have a little stretcher here and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.490 
just to have a little stretcher here and
a<00:04:02.040> little<00:04:02.220> stretcher<00:04:02.730> here<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.270> was<00:04:04.050> done<00:04:04.230> in

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
a little stretcher here as was done in

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.670 
a little stretcher here as was done in
the<00:04:05.010> other<00:04:05.670> left<00:04:06.180> base<00:04:06.360> cabinet<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.110> as<00:04:07.230> what

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
the other left base cabinet and as what

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.500 
the other left base cabinet and as what
will<00:04:07.830> be<00:04:07.980> done<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.550> sink<00:04:08.790> base<00:04:09.000> cabinet

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
will be done in the sink base cabinet

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.360 
will be done in the sink base cabinet
that<00:04:09.660> you'll<00:04:09.780> see<00:04:10.050> in<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.740> next<00:04:10.890> series<00:04:11.190> of

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
that you'll see in the next series of

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.220 
that you'll see in the next series of
videos<00:04:11.700> for<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.030> sink<00:04:12.300> base<00:04:12.480> when<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:12.870> finish

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
videos for the sink base when we finish

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.070 
videos for the sink base when we finish
the<00:04:13.410> overall<00:04:13.740> kitchen<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.360> just<00:04:15.780> opted

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
the overall kitchen and so I just opted

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.710 
the overall kitchen and so I just opted
to<00:04:16.830> put<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:18.620> panel<00:04:19.620> here<00:04:20.010> fully<00:04:20.670> inset<00:04:21.420> in<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
to put the panel here fully inset in the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.330 
to put the panel here fully inset in the
cabinet<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.710> bit<00:04:22.830> more<00:04:23.070> wood<00:04:23.310> I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
cabinet it's a little bit more wood I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.240 
cabinet it's a little bit more wood I
know<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:23.820> probably<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.330> waste<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:24.990> but<00:04:25.620> again

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
know it's probably a waste but but again

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.420 
know it's probably a waste but but again
it<00:04:26.640> gives<00:04:26.880> me<00:04:27.320> definitely<00:04:28.320> squares<00:04:29.100> up<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
it gives me definitely squares up the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430 
it gives me definitely squares up the
cabinet<00:04:29.880> really<00:04:30.180> nicely<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.990> gives<00:04:31.230> me<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
cabinet really nicely it gives me a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.670 
cabinet really nicely it gives me a
solid<00:04:32.130> top<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.600> anchor<00:04:33.960> whatever<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.380> want<00:04:34.620> to

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
solid top to anchor whatever I want to

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.310 
solid top to anchor whatever I want to
anchor<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.370> namely<00:04:35.730> this<00:04:36.180> post<00:04:36.570> here

anchor to it namely this post here

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.920 
anchor to it namely this post here
um<00:04:37.670> that's<00:04:38.670> going<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> be<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.270> post<00:04:39.510> for

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
um that's going to be the post for

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.340 
um that's going to be the post for
holding<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.320> lazy<00:04:40.530> susan<00:04:40.940> turntables<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.350> so

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
holding the lazy susan turntables and so

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810 
holding the lazy susan turntables and so
that's<00:04:43.620> kind<00:04:43.920> of<00:04:43.980> what<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.190> opted<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.640> do

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
that's kind of what I opted to do

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.460 
that's kind of what I opted to do
usually<00:04:45.120> when<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.570> make<00:04:45.810> these<00:04:45.990> types<00:04:46.320> of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
usually when I make these types of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.620 
usually when I make these types of
cabinets<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.700> other<00:04:47.820> thing<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.330> would<00:04:48.450> point

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
cabinets the other thing I would point

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.360 
cabinets the other thing I would point
out<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.590> we're<00:04:49.770> going<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.950> be<00:04:50.040> just

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
out is that we're going to be just

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.490 
out is that we're going to be just
adding<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.910> little<00:04:50.940> bit<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.330> base<00:04:51.690> blocker<00:04:52.170> at

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
adding a little bit of base blocker at

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.740 
adding a little bit of base blocker at
the<00:04:52.620> bottom<00:04:53.040> a<00:04:53.310> little<00:04:53.640> bit<00:04:53.760> of<00:04:53.910> blocking<00:04:54.300> for

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
the bottom a little bit of blocking for

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.750 
the bottom a little bit of blocking for
the<00:04:54.810> base<00:04:54.960> at<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.200> bottom<00:04:55.590> here<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> what's

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
the base at the bottom here and what's

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.170 
the base at the bottom here and what's
this<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.270> really<00:04:57.960> serving<00:04:58.470> two<00:04:58.770> purposes<00:04:59.180> one

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
this is really serving two purposes one

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.210 
this is really serving two purposes one
and<00:05:00.570> kind<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.140> lesser<00:05:01.500> purpose<00:05:01.950> in<00:05:02.130> a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
and kind of the lesser purpose in a

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.760 
and kind of the lesser purpose in a
cabinet<00:05:02.580> that's<00:05:02.760> that's<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.570> small<00:05:04.380> I'll

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
cabinet that's that's this small I'll

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.860 
cabinet that's that's this small I'll
say<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.070> guess<00:05:05.400> it's<00:05:05.610> not<00:05:05.760> that<00:05:05.970> big<00:05:06.180> but<00:05:06.240> the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
say I guess it's not that big but the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.900 
say I guess it's not that big but the
first<00:05:07.110> purpose<00:05:07.470> is<00:05:07.650> it<00:05:07.770> does<00:05:08.070> provide<00:05:08.490> some

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
first purpose is it does provide some

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.780 
first purpose is it does provide some
support<00:05:09.410> for<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:11.100> know<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.370> weight<00:05:11.550> that

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
support for you know the weight that

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.730 
support for you know the weight that
might<00:05:12.000> be<00:05:12.150> inside<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.600> this<00:05:12.810> cabinet<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.530> the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
might be inside of this cabinet that the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.070 
might be inside of this cabinet that the
lazy<00:05:14.010> susan<00:05:14.370> isn't<00:05:15.060> going<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.300> sag<00:05:15.690> or

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
lazy susan isn't going to sag or

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.960 
lazy susan isn't going to sag or
something<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.010> or<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:17.460> weight<00:05:17.760> that's

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
something like that or the weight that's

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.790 
something like that or the weight that's
on<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.300> lazy<00:05:18.510> susan<00:05:18.840> isn't<00:05:19.350> going<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.560> cause

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
on the lazy susan isn't going to cause

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.740 
on the lazy susan isn't going to cause
the<00:05:20.130> bottom<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.700> bowl<00:05:20.910> out<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.420> it<00:05:21.570> does

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
the bottom to bowl out so it does

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.630 
the bottom to bowl out so it does
provide<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.170> little<00:05:22.380> bit<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.680> support<00:05:22.830> but<00:05:23.550> it

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
provide a little bit of support but it

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.960 
provide a little bit of support but it
but<00:05:24.150> mostly<00:05:24.660> why<00:05:24.840> we<00:05:24.990> put<00:05:25.230> this<00:05:25.890> in<00:05:26.160> is<00:05:26.340> for<00:05:26.640> toe

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
but mostly why we put this in is for toe

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.510 
but mostly why we put this in is for toe
kick<00:05:27.240> backing<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.530> I'll<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:28.920> able<00:05:29.160> to<00:05:29.280> come

patience with yourself and and make sure
that<00:06:40.110> you<00:06:40.200> just<00:06:40.350> break<00:06:40.560> everything<00:06:40.890> down<00:06:41.310> into

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
that you just break everything down into

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.420 
that you just break everything down into
its<00:06:42.390> and<00:06:42.720> into<00:06:43.080> its<00:06:43.230> basic<00:06:43.650> pieces<00:06:43.890> and<00:06:44.340> then

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
its and into its basic pieces and then

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.310 
its and into its basic pieces and then
it<00:06:44.550> becomes<00:06:45.060> a<00:06:45.180> lot<00:06:45.330> easier<00:06:45.360> to<00:06:45.810> understand

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.320 
it becomes a lot easier to understand

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.080 
it becomes a lot easier to understand
and<00:06:46.440> put<00:06:46.620> together<00:06:46.800> so<00:06:47.580> it's<00:06:47.700> definitely

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
and put together so it's definitely

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.420 
and put together so it's definitely
something<00:06:48.330> you<00:06:48.450> can<00:06:48.720> tackle<00:06:49.050> and<00:06:49.500> I'm<00:06:50.220> going
