you get it there continue to draw make

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.840 
you get it there continue to draw make
sure<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.380> consistent<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.009> make<00:01:59.460> sure<00:01:59.670> that

and<00:02:01.799> every<00:02:01.950> time<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.250> come<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> full<00:02:02.700> draw

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and every time you come to full draw

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120 
and every time you come to full draw
then<00:02:03.509> what<00:02:03.780> you've<00:02:03.960> done<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.229> given<00:02:04.710> yourself

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
then what you've done is given yourself

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.160 
then what you've done is given yourself
a<00:02:06.110> 100%<00:02:07.110> firm<00:02:07.550> anchor<00:02:08.550> point<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.300> reference

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
a 100% firm anchor point a reference

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.080 
a 100% firm anchor point a reference
point<00:02:10.440> you'll<00:02:11.009> also<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:11.940> you're

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
point you'll also know that if you're

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.820 
point you'll also know that if you're
torquing<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.660> bow<00:02:13.020> because<00:02:13.470> if<00:02:13.590> you're

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
torquing the bow because if you're

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.590 
torquing the bow because if you're
pull<00:02:14.160> draw<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.820> grip<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.300> you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
pull draw and you have a grip and you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.450 
pull draw and you have a grip and you
torque<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.320> little<00:02:16.440> bit<00:02:16.590> there's<00:02:17.160> no

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
torque it just a little bit there's no

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.070 
torque it just a little bit there's no
way<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.060> green<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.510> black<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.900> line

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
way that that green and black can line

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410 
way that that green and black can line
up<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.580> gonna<00:02:20.790> be<00:02:20.970> used<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
up so is this gonna be used on a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.240 
up so is this gonna be used on a
ten-yard<00:02:21.930> shot<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> doe<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.860> green<00:02:23.070> field

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
ten-yard shot on a doe in a green field

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
ten-yard shot on a doe in a green field
probably<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.180> because<00:02:24.480> you're<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
probably not because you're going to be

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.300 
probably not because you're going to be
consistent<00:02:25.230> enough<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.040> shot

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
consistent enough to make that shot

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.710 
consistent enough to make that shot
however<00:02:26.700> what<00:02:26.940> I've<00:02:27.090> noticed<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:27.570> I'm

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
however what I've noticed when I'm

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.080 
however what I've noticed when I'm
practicing<00:02:27.960> I'll<00:02:28.920> come<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.430> full<00:02:29.610> draw<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.030> if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
practicing I'll come to full draw and if

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.540 
practicing I'll come to full draw and if
I'm<00:02:30.240> at<00:02:30.360> 40<00:02:30.780> 50<00:02:31.110> 60<00:02:31.440> yards<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> range<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
I'm at 40 50 60 yards on the range the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.190 
I'm at 40 50 60 yards on the range the
first<00:02:32.820> thing<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.120> do<00:02:33.180> out<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.600> peripheral<00:02:33.990> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
first thing I do out of my peripheral is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.990 
first thing I do out of my peripheral is
glance<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.280> black<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.790> greens

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
glance and if that black and greens

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
glance and if that black and greens
there<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.990> my<00:02:37.320> form<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.740> perfect<00:02:38.160> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
there I know that my form is perfect and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
there I know that my form is perfect and
I<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.760> I'm<00:02:38.850> ready<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.270> try<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.930> shot

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
I know that I'm ready to try that shot

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650 
I know that I'm ready to try that shot
it<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> better<00:02:41.550> mousetrap<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.510> what

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it really is a better mousetrap and what

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.290 
it really is a better mousetrap and what
happens<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.260> after<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.950> shoot<00:02:44.300> repetitively

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
happens is after you shoot repetitively

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.630 
happens is after you shoot repetitively
over<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> over<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.740> over<00:02:46.980> again<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.520> about

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
over and over and over again it's about

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.150 
over and over and over again it's about
it's<00:02:48.240> about<00:02:48.360> muscle<00:02:48.930> memory<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.620> everybody

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it's about muscle memory and everybody

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.890 
it's about muscle memory and everybody
knows<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.760> an<00:02:50.940> archer<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.300> more<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
knows that as an archer the more you

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900 
knows that as an archer the more you
shoot<00:02:52.140> obviously<00:02:53.010> then<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.790> the

moment your muscle memory kind of takes
over<00:02:57.270> what's<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.020> same<00:02:58.290> exact<00:02:58.770> principle

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
over what's the same exact principle

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.090 
over what's the same exact principle
with<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.670> IQ<00:02:59.970> site<00:03:00.510> all<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.320> sudden<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.830> see

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
with the IQ site all of a sudden you see

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.650 
with the IQ site all of a sudden you see
that<00:03:02.310> green<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.940> black<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.480> your

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that green and black out of your

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.300 
that green and black out of your
peripheral<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:05.100> you're<00:03:05.220> not

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
peripheral you know that you're not

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.130 
peripheral you know that you're not
talking<00:03:05.580> your<00:03:05.820> bow<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.480> also<00:03:06.690> know<00:03:07.110> that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
talking your bow and you also know that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.870 
talking your bow and you also know that
you<00:03:07.380> got<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> consistent<00:03:08.190> anchor<00:03:08.459> point<00:03:08.670> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
you got a consistent anchor point and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.699 
you got a consistent anchor point and
that's<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.390> key<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.660> setting<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.320> thing<00:03:10.530> up

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
that's the key to setting that thing up

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.770 
that's the key to setting that thing up
originally<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.490> making<00:03:12.150> sure<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.420> you're
