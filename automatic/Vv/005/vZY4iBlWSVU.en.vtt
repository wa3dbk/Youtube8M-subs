00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello tankers special hello to mine 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.780
 dear subscribers guys today i 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 I want to show you very interesting 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.450
 the moment of the game in the random on the bottom cutting on 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.760
 white park map but I will answer the question 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.619
 which for some reason every day 5 times 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 I meet on the official forum 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.440
 question is it possible to hide behind 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.390
 fallen tree let's say so 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.609
 Simultaneous etirii here and when it is 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.030
 will make look ahead 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:40.999
 in front of me 7 at the moment just 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.949
 still given a tree for which I run 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.339
 I will show you very successfully 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.829
 hide maybe you will 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.229
 criticize what I borrowed instead of losing 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.449
 so on generally need a heavy tank 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.649
 play differently that 's your right with 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.139
 I can agree you can not 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.329
 I agree in the general case in your operas 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.670
 Pts here nobody went in the second I 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.549
 here very successfully I played themselves 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.490
 see so want to criticize want 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.909
 but there again I say the wires to your 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.920
 watch you saw yes already while I'm here 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.810
 chatted what was happening that I got up for 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.299
 bushes stood behind bushes in the distance 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.280
 more than 15 meters as you see bushes 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.549
 opaque on me leave t110 e4 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.530
 the enemy has successfully punched his light bulb 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 I do not light up believe it I have 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.740
 pumped in this make sure a little 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.299
 later, that is, I shot out without problems 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.329
 that is, not only am I not visible 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:44.119
 yes for the fallen tree of the body before 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.770
 sunset and many ask i smell calmly 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.009
 shooting back here again I shot back 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.730
 a shot well, and oglis this case 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.800
 without breaking anything 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.950
 but at least no one sees me 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.920
 Here, too, with the breaking of Dalamuda could 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.610
 There is here, watch slowly, I insist 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.880
 I do not touch anyone thousands of damage already 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.880
 look further 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.750
 usually on this map for many play 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.530
 how do we sovzvodnye you see us too 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.210
 doing the right thing I love so much too 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.270
 precisely American tanks due to the angles 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:27.220
 tip shoot center card 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.870
 along the railroad is great so 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.420
 believe me here is a variation of them already 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.090
 nobody took him here and if he was taken 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.460
 you can get off very well from point e1 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.880
 vd1 well depending on the position 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:46.880
 enemy technology will see for yourself but how do you 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 have seen damage to one of the most dangerous 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.710
 enemy tanks and also probably all 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.010
 yet in the most dangerous enemy tank I 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.080
 already given twice and he leaves the third time 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.720
 for some reason this is not clear to me too yes 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.090
 and 110 94 pin 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.950
 literate player got a spank 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.950
 waited again left again got 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.090
 splat 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:17.140
 As far as I do not change you 300 m from 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.290
 but his sorrows, but the battle gradually goes on 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.129
 gets out m103 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.660
 something ailment did not work 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.000
 in fact, if this m103 were 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:37.569
 I probably didn't get here 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.310
 a little longer and ground leaves 110 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.680
 Tanchik but gradual here becomes 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.530
 many of our opponents already poslivat 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.579
 I already feel that you need to slowly 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.489
 will change here to go 110 wanted 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.470
 pick failed to shoot at that place 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.510
 where it should be its not then for 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.920
 understand that I post light 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.980
 the crow is definitely bitter you are lucky for me 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.120
 someone missed me here and look 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.000
 union thanks 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.150
 what t69 which flight tour i have become 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.370
 By the way, too, with a good start and a guy 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.310
 starts all sorts of nasty things not to know the type 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.889
 Here I am the bottom and this shot is not clear why 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:23.139
 and so on yes but damage inflicted on 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.789
 the screen you see here actually probably 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.110
 all i wanted to show you on this 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.750
 I won't give you a map 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.010
 show the whole fight but was enough 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.990
 quite good we won 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.550
 I eventually died from not finished off in the mouth 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.550
 she stayed there to persuade 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.169
 we won the fight 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.639
 that's all but look like you put 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:50.940
 Damage 3 700 in my very good 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.940
 thank you all for watching good luck
