articulation throughout his body but
let's<00:01:22.799> start<00:01:23.070> first<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> head<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:24.509> we

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
let's start first at the head where we

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
let's start first at the head where we
have<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> ball<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.259> socket<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
have a ball and socket but again it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.090 
have a ball and socket but again it
mostly<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.180> swivels<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
mostly just swivels a little bit of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.340 
mostly just swivels a little bit of
motion<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> ball<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
motion up and down you have a ball and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.340 
motion up and down you have a ball and
socket<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.450> shoulders<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
socket on the the shoulders here so you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.499 
socket on the the shoulders here so you
can<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.590> those<00:01:34.710> arms<00:01:35.060> where<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.390> go

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can get those arms where they need to go

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.080 
can get those arms where they need to go
you<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> hinge<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.460> elbow<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
you have a hinge on the elbow and the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.050 
you have a hinge on the elbow and the
elbow<00:01:39.479> works<00:01:40.409> okay<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.250> tight<00:01:41.610> joint

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
elbow works okay it's a very tight joint

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.800 
elbow works okay it's a very tight joint
and<00:01:43.250> that's<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.579> far<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and that's about as far as it can go so

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
and that's about as far as it can go so
you're<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.380> ton<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.979> great

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
you're not going to get a ton of great

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.450 
you're not going to get a ton of great

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
much the hips are very interesting where

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
much the hips are very interesting where
the<00:02:10.319> pelvis<00:02:10.890> meets<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.370> leg<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> ball

the pelvis meets the leg you have a ball

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.020 
the pelvis meets the leg you have a ball
and<00:02:12.660> socket<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.319> most

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
and socket but most

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.720 
and socket but most
it's<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.360> used<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> swivel<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:17.370> can

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it's you do used as a swivel that can

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.140 
it's you do used as a swivel that can
have<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> little<00:02:18.780> bit<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> movement<00:02:19.910> back<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
have a little bit of movement back and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.540 
have a little bit of movement back and
forth<00:02:21.420> there<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.380> standard<00:02:22.950> hinge<00:02:23.280> on

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
forth there you have a standard hinge on

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.770 
forth there you have a standard hinge on
the<00:02:24.360> knee<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.410> then<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.130> have<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:27.090> awesome

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the knee and then you have the awesome

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.860 
the knee and then you have the awesome
hinge<00:02:28.350> with<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.010> crazy<00:02:29.310> piston<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.630> ankle

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
hinge with the crazy piston on the ankle

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.310 
hinge with the crazy piston on the ankle
so<00:02:31.710> overall<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.970> robocop<00:02:33.870> into<00:02:34.170> any

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
so overall you can get robocop into any

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.530 
so overall you can get robocop into any
kind<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.590> position<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:35.100> really<00:02:35.340> need<00:02:35.540> perfect
