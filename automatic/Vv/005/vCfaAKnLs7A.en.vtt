one<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.360> aware<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> Grizzlies

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one I was aware that on the Grizzlies

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
one I was aware that on the Grizzlies
some<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> Grizzlies<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> solid

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
some of the Grizzlies they have a solid

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
some of the Grizzlies they have a solid
on<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> pin<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.980> goes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
on here and they have a pin that goes

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.500 
on here and they have a pin that goes
through<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.350> thought<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.510> they

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
through and I thought you know they

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
through and I thought you know they
don't<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.930> something<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.230> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
don't do something like that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
don't do something like that
that's<00:00:55.770> gas<00:00:56.039> isn't<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.520> thought<00:00:57.090> surely<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that's gas isn't I thought surely I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's gas isn't I thought surely I
could<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> arrangement

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
could make up a lot in the arrangement

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
could make up a lot in the arrangement
for<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.180> willing<00:01:00.359> it's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.330 
see just run a bit of an axe through
and<00:02:14.300> that's<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.570> that's<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> gadget<00:02:17.130> that's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and that's the that's the gadget that's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.270 
and that's the that's the gadget that's
all<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.640> need<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.680> I'll<00:02:19.680> show<00:02:19.830> how<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.100> works

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
all you need and I'll show how it works

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.210 
all you need and I'll show how it works
right<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.600> bolt<00:02:25.410> hole<00:02:25.710> drilled

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
right you can see that bolt hole drilled

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.560 
right you can see that bolt hole drilled
through<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:27.290> bit<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.740> yes<00:02:29.010> or<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.450> see

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
through the bit of a yes or you can see

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.210 
through the bit of a yes or you can see
the<00:02:30.660> wrong<00:02:30.870> pin<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.770> I've<00:02:31.920> knocked<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
the wrong pin that I've knocked in and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.740 
the wrong pin that I've knocked in and
now<00:02:35.220> put<00:02:35.490> together<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.970> show<00:02:36.180> how<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.450> works

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.290 

well<00:02:39.750> here's<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.380> latch<00:02:40.730> fitted<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.880> from<00:02:42.120> the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
well here's the latch fitted on from the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:57.680 
well here's the latch fitted on from the
yeah<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.620> bandsaw<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:54.390> locks<00:02:56.690> little

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
yeah the bandsaw and and it locks little

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.510 
yeah the bandsaw and and it locks little
roll<00:02:57.900> pinned<00:02:58.260> I've<00:02:58.440> got<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:58.770> here<00:02:59.010> which<00:02:59.250> stops

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
roll pinned I've got in here which stops

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.290 
roll pinned I've got in here which stops
that<00:02:59.700> coming

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
that coming

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.610 
that coming
mm<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.790> keeps<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.210> arm<00:03:03.390> away<00:03:04.290> from

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
mm so that just keeps the arm away from

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.450 
mm so that just keeps the arm away from
spring<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.640> lift<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:08.190> saw<00:03:08.430> up

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
spring because if I lift that the saw up

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.920 
spring because if I lift that the saw up
to<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.790> vertical<00:03:09.060> position<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.690> spring

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to the vertical position the spring

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.810 
to the vertical position the spring
position<00:03:10.380> will<00:03:10.530> change<00:03:12.140> no<00:03:13.140> worries

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
position will change no worries

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.510 
position will change no worries
so<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.030> go<00:03:15.290> our<00:03:16.290> simples<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.950> work

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
so there you go our simples that I work

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.370 
so there you go our simples that I work
the<00:03:17.670> treat<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.980> yeah<00:03:19.980> when<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.250> will<00:03:20.520> up<00:03:20.670> now<00:03:21.380> no

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
the treat so yeah when I will up now no

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.920 
the treat so yeah when I will up now no
more<00:03:22.680> problems<00:03:23.130> with<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.540> swing<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:24.810> and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
more problems with that swing it up and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.750 
more problems with that swing it up and
then<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.140> thing<00:03:25.350> trying<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.680> tip<00:03:26.070> over<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.550> me

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
then the thing trying to tip over on me

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.320 
then the thing trying to tip over on me
that<00:03:27.660> locks<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.190> really<00:03:29.190> well<00:03:29.460> you're<00:03:30.180> not

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
that locks it really well you're not

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.300 
that locks it really well you're not
weakening<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.140> arm<00:03:31.500> by<00:03:31.860> drilling<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.250> hole

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
weakening the arm by drilling a hole

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.760 
weakening the arm by drilling a hole
through<00:03:32.790> all<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.690> Grizzlies<00:03:34.110> they<00:03:34.290> have<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> a

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
through all the Grizzlies they have a a

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.530 
through all the Grizzlies they have a a
pin<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.340> goes<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.670> through<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.880> other<00:03:36.030> arm

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
pin that goes in through the other arm

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.090 
pin that goes in through the other arm
is<00:03:36.690> solid<00:03:37.140> right<00:03:37.320> through<00:03:37.650> where<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.040> this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
is solid right through where it's this

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.160 
is solid right through where it's this
is<00:03:38.280> Wed<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.120> wouldn't<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.540> too<00:03:39.750> keen<00:03:39.990> on

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
is Wed so I wouldn't be too keen on

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.860 
is Wed so I wouldn't be too keen on
drilling<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.880> I'm<00:03:41.880> putting<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.180> pin<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.600> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
drilling that I'm putting a pin in so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.380 
drilling that I'm putting a pin in so
this<00:03:43.020> works<00:03:43.200> quite<00:03:43.410> good<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:45.020> it<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:48.210> doesn't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
this works quite good and it it doesn't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.330 
this works quite good and it it doesn't
get<00:03:48.630> them<00:03:48.750> away<00:03:48.960> it's<00:03:49.560> not<00:03:49.710> too<00:03:49.860> bad<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.220> all

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
get them away it's not too bad at all

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.830 
get them away it's not too bad at all
really<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:52.370> mean<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.520> could<00:03:53.730> even<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.690> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
really and I mean you could even if you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.220 
really and I mean you could even if you
wanted<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:57.420> could<00:03:57.540> even<00:03:57.720> drill<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:57.990> hole

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
wanted to you could even drill a hole

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.690 
wanted to you could even drill a hole
get<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:58.890> position<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.960> we're<00:04:00.960> back<00:04:01.170> very

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
get in this position so we're back very

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.280 
get in this position so we're back very
drill<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.790> holes<00:04:03.000> right<00:04:03.210> here<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.140> can

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
drill the holes right here so you can

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.760 
drill the holes right here so you can
put<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.440> pin<00:04:04.680> through<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:05.130> keep<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.700> away<00:04:05.790> from

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
put a pin through to keep it away from

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.160 
put a pin through to keep it away from
further<00:04:07.770> away<00:04:07.920> from<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.280> jaws<00:04:08.520> but<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.270> don't

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
further away from the jaws but I don't

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.240 
further away from the jaws but I don't
think<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.350> gonna<00:04:10.410> be<00:04:10.590> working<00:04:10.920> down<00:04:11.040> this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
think you gonna be working down this

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.950 
think you gonna be working down this
area<00:04:11.670> anyway<00:04:11.880> because<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.660> only

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
area anyway because this is only

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.130 
area anyway because this is only
effective<00:04:13.520> cutting<00:04:14.520> distance<00:04:15.030> here<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.720> one

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
effective cutting distance here so one

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.720 
effective cutting distance here so one
as<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:18.260> works<00:04:19.260> fantastic<00:04:19.980> see<00:04:20.310> how<00:04:20.430> simple

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
as it is works fantastic see how simple

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.270 
as it is works fantastic see how simple
that<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:22.250> not<00:04:23.250> hard<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.550> make<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:25.010> we<00:04:26.010> want<00:04:26.190> to

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
that a not hard to make and we want to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.990 
that a not hard to make and we want to
roll<00:04:26.460> pin

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
roll pin

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.250 
roll pin
that<00:04:27.210> still<00:04:27.540> in<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.650> bowl<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.490> wear<00:04:29.960> bronze<00:04:30.960> or

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
that still in a bowl to wear bronze or

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.420 
that still in a bowl to wear bronze or
welding<00:04:32.690> but<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.840> certainly<00:04:34.050> looks<00:04:35.330> good

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
welding but it certainly looks good

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.270 
welding but it certainly looks good
stop<00:04:38.430> Sarah<00:04:38.670> I'm<00:04:38.820> coming<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.650> yeah<00:04:40.650> it's<00:04:41.160> a

stop Sarah I'm coming up and yeah it's a
good<00:04:41.430> simple<00:04:42.180> mod<00:04:42.840> which<00:04:43.640> basically

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
good simple mod which basically

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.510 
good simple mod which basically
interested<00:04:45.470> reverse<00:04:46.470> version<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.250> what<00:04:47.400> they

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
interested reverse version of what they

modification<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:12.120> did<00:05:12.330> I<00:05:12.710> noticed<00:05:13.710> when<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:13.860> was

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
modification I did I noticed when I was

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.340 
modification I did I noticed when I was
looking<00:05:14.580> at<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.150> video<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.750> did<00:05:15.900> this

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
looking at the video that it did this

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.580 
looking at the video that it did this
sort<00:05:16.530> of<00:05:16.590> wing<00:05:16.830> did<00:05:17.010> flex<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.460> little<00:05:17.490> bit<00:05:18.590> only

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
sort of wing did flex a little bit only

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.350 
sort of wing did flex a little bit only
being<00:05:19.800> weld<00:05:20.040> on<00:05:20.220> one<00:05:20.400> side<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:21.000> was<00:05:21.120> just

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
being weld on one side it was just

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.700 
being weld on one side it was just
flexing<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> little<00:05:22.080> bit<00:05:22.230> so<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:24.110> put<00:05:25.110> in<00:05:25.290> a<00:05:25.410> year

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
flexing a little bit so I put in a year

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.090 
flexing a little bit so I put in a year
and<00:05:26.430> angle<00:05:27.030> bracket<00:05:27.419> and<00:05:27.450> then<00:05:27.650> 300<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.950> for

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
and angle bracket and then 300 out for

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.290 
and angle bracket and then 300 out for
the<00:05:29.160> shape<00:05:29.370> of<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.610> spring<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:31.550> it<00:05:32.550> makes<00:05:33.240> it

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
the shape of the spring so it makes it

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.570 
the shape of the spring so it makes it
nice<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.510> rigid<00:05:33.780> there<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.350> if<00:05:34.470> you<00:05:34.620> do<00:05:34.800> do<00:05:35.460> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
nice and rigid there so if you do do the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.750 
nice and rigid there so if you do do the
modification<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.990> was<00:05:37.200> probably<00:05:37.590> just

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
modification it was probably just

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.710 
modification it was probably just
putting<00:05:38.760> a<00:05:38.790> little<00:05:38.820> bit<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.090> angle<00:05:39.390> in<00:05:39.510> like

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
putting a little bit of angle in like

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.270 
putting a little bit of angle in like
that<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.140> it<00:05:40.560> just<00:05:40.590> makes<00:05:40.830> everything<00:05:41.010> a<00:05:41.220> lot

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
that and it just makes everything a lot

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.430 
that and it just makes everything a lot
stronger<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:41.910> yeah<00:05:42.390> anyway<00:05:42.870> that's<00:05:43.290> it

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
stronger so yeah anyway that's it

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.100 
stronger so yeah anyway that's it
definitely<00:05:44.040> end<00:05:44.370> of<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.520> video<00:05:44.729> so<00:05:44.790> okay<00:05:45.690> see

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
definitely end of the video so okay see
