notes on the three and the end so the
bass<00:01:05.670> drum<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.360> E<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.470> AH<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
bass drum is on the E and the AH this is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030 
bass drum is on the E and the AH this is
tough<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.080> once<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
tough at first but once you get it it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:26.639 
tough at first but once you get it it
sounds<00:01:11.400> great

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.289 

number<00:01:27.649> three<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.130> similar<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.850> number<00:01:29.119> two

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
number three is similar to number two

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.870 
number three is similar to number two
except<00:01:30.109> we're<00:01:30.320> expanding<00:01:30.679> on<00:01:31.039> the<00:01:31.130> concept<00:01:31.700> of

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
except we're expanding on the concept of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.300 
except we're expanding on the concept of
inserting<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.570> bass<00:01:32.840> drum<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.380> wherever<00:01:33.979> we

inserting that bass drum in wherever we
want<00:01:34.579> so<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.210> can<00:01:35.390> see<00:01:35.600> I<00:01:35.810> have<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.619> e

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
want so you can see I have it on the e

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.730 
want so you can see I have it on the e
the<00:01:37.340> AH<00:01:37.520> of<00:01:37.909> one<00:01:38.509> then<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.259> have<00:01:39.439> it<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.710> E

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
the AH of one then I have it on the E

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.880 
the AH of one then I have it on the E
and<00:01:39.890> I've<00:01:40.310> -<00:01:40.729> same<00:01:41.569> with<00:01:41.719> E<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.109> AH<00:01:42.170> three<00:01:42.289> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
and I've - same with E and AH three and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.980 
and I've - same with E and AH three and
then<00:01:43.490> nothing<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.000> four<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:44.569> that<00:01:44.750> kind

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
then nothing on the four then that kind

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.990 
then nothing on the four then that kind
of<00:01:45.049> resets<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.920> beat<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.520> you<00:01:46.579> start<00:01:46.880> again

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
of resets the beat and you start again

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.789 
of resets the beat and you start again
on<00:01:47.209> the<00:01:47.299> one<00:01:47.509> I<00:01:47.719> know<00:01:48.259> it<00:01:48.439> might<00:01:48.590> sound

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
on the one I know it might sound

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.100 
on the one I know it might sound
confusing<00:01:49.069> at<00:01:49.640> first<00:01:49.670> I'll<00:01:50.209> play<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.780> for<00:01:50.959> you

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
confusing at first I'll play it for you

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.309 
confusing at first I'll play it for you
now

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
now

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.260 
now
and<00:01:51.530> then<00:01:51.950> later<00:01:52.159> on<00:01:52.369> after<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.729> lesson<00:01:53.119> you

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and then later on after the lesson you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:10.900 
and then later on after the lesson you
can<00:01:53.420> take<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:53.750> your<00:01:53.899> kit<00:02:09.340> number<00:02:10.340> four<00:02:10.640> is

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
can take it to your kit number four is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.539 
can take it to your kit number four is
similar<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.959> last<00:02:12.110> two<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.620> did<00:02:12.829> we're

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
similar to the last two we did we're

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.550 
similar to the last two we did we're
inserting<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.120> bass<00:02:14.299> drum<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.780> between<00:02:15.380> the

eighth<00:02:15.680> notes<00:02:16.040> again<00:02:31.389> in<00:02:32.389> number<00:02:33.079> five<00:02:33.380> we

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
eighth notes again in number five we

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.949 
eighth notes again in number five we
don't<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> bass<00:02:34.609> drum<00:02:34.639> on<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.420> downbeat

the<00:02:38.060> e<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.540> one<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.859> is<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> little<00:02:40.489> difficult

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
the e of one this is a little difficult

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.330 
the e of one this is a little difficult
to<00:02:41.150> actually<00:02:41.299> start<00:02:41.840> off<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.350> groove<00:02:42.590> once

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
to actually start off the groove once

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.309 
to actually start off the groove once
you<00:02:43.459> get<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.359> really<00:02:44.540> add<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> lot<00:02:44.930> of

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
you get it you can really add a lot of

00:02:45.319 --> 00:03:03.090 
you get it you can really add a lot of
creativity<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:46.220> all<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.760> grooves

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.710 

number<00:03:04.100> six<00:03:04.460> is<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.700> little<00:03:05.000> bit<00:03:05.120> different<00:03:05.570> in

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
number six is a little bit different in
