00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.330
 Syrian pepper also do not 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.570
 He found who will try to replace with 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:44.150
 the black pepper kingdom and we choose Cinnamon 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.310

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.209
 we will try to see who 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.830
 will stay I think just for the knife no 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.570

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.670
 also more or less here the little bit more 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.769
 maybe and mix with your hands even without 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.200
 today who's going to do this here to stay 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.200
 very homogeneous in the same mass claimed 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.650

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.200
 It has original recipe of our making 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.620
 peel drive letter 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 I'm sorry but the letter makes a cookie for 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.630
 My cookie with her to shine on you. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.640

 We will do the following we have 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.560
 same thing is written here about what 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.270
 We have to respect the cheese in the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.190

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:09.940
 meat is eating right who goes 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.640

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.210
 Because she's very fit, she'll be sticking up 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.030
 on the outside but who get juicy for 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.830
 inside can be too expensive not ok 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.090
 a little separated so as not to stick in 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.090
 win and close here 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.760
