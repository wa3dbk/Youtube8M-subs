those but I've kept it on at the entire
life<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.449> lens<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:56.430> one<00:00:56.699> condition<00:00:57.090> issue

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
life of the lens the one condition issue

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
life of the lens the one condition issue
of<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.870> lens<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.460> has<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> sticky

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
of this lens is that it has a sticky

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720 
of this lens is that it has a sticky
zoom<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.289> zoom<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.829> call<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> sticky

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
zoom to it the zoom I call it sticky

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.320 
zoom to it the zoom I call it sticky
it's<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.329> bit<00:01:03.510> tight<00:01:04.820> optically<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.150> lens

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's it's a bit tight optically the lens

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.080 
it's it's a bit tight optically the lens
is<00:01:06.600> absolutely<00:01:07.260> perfect<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.850> glass

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
is absolutely perfect and the glass

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.320 
is absolutely perfect and the glass
itself<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.900> immaculate<00:01:10.790> when<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
itself is immaculate when I say that it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.160 
itself is immaculate when I say that it
has<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> tight<00:01:12.869> zoom<00:01:14.479> you'll<00:01:15.479> notice<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
has a tight zoom you'll notice I have a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.140 
has a tight zoom you'll notice I have a
couple<00:01:16.439> 24<00:01:16.979> 70<00:01:17.460> s<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:19.320> has<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
couple 24 70 s and this one just has a

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.499 
couple 24 70 s and this one just has a
bit<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.570> stick<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.020> catch<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
bit of kind of stick and catch to it

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.359 
bit of kind of stick and catch to it
especially<00:01:24.509> down<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.049> lower<00:01:25.320> end<00:01:25.710> between

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
especially down at the lower end between

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
especially down at the lower end between
70<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.130> 35<00:01:29.130> millimeters<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.900> notice

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
70 and 35 millimeters you don't notice

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.039 
70 and 35 millimeters you don't notice
any<00:01:31.439> difference<00:01:32.180> from<00:01:33.180> normal<00:01:33.540> operation

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
any difference from normal operation

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.190 
any difference from normal operation
between<00:01:34.229> 24<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.009> 35<00:01:35.689> 50<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.869> gets<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> little

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
between 24 and 35 50 it gets a little

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
between 24 and 35 50 it gets a little
sticky<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.130> mostly<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.729> from<00:01:38.939> 70

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
sticky and it's mostly going from 70

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
sticky and it's mostly going from 70
down<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.990> 35<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> notice<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.259> sometimes<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
down to 35 that I notice it sometimes I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.389 
down to 35 that I notice it sometimes I
almost<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.350> rather

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
almost get a little bit of rather

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.660 
almost get a little bit of rather
internal<00:01:47.399> elements<00:01:47.939> just<00:01:48.390> slightly

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
internal elements just slightly

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.660 
internal elements just slightly
basically<00:01:51.439> as<00:01:52.439> I've<00:01:52.680> been<00:01:52.890> told<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.430> local

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
basically as I've been told by my local

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically as I've been told by my local
Nikon<00:01:54.570> guy<00:01:54.780> who<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.020> trust<00:01:55.409> implicitly<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
Nikon guy who I trust implicitly the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
Nikon guy who I trust implicitly the
issue<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.670> either<00:01:59.790> needs<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.240> be

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
issue is that it either needs to be

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
issue is that it either needs to be
internally<00:02:01.079> lubricated<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> needs

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
internally lubricated or that it needs

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.340 
internally lubricated or that it needs
bearings<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.200> allow<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
bearings which allow the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.010 
bearings which allow the
the<00:02:06.010> zoom<00:02:06.250> top<00:02:06.490> rate<00:02:06.760> smoothly<00:02:07.360> neither<00:02:07.660> which

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
the zoom top rate smoothly neither which

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.430 
the zoom top rate smoothly neither which
effect<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:09.420> optical<00:02:10.420> quality<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.230> lens

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
effect the optical quality of the lens

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.580 
effect the optical quality of the lens
but<00:02:12.340> both<00:02:12.670> do<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.300> towards<00:02:13.780> its<00:02:14.230> smooth

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
but both do go towards its smooth

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.110 
but both do go towards its smooth
operation<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.580> mean<00:02:18.640> I'll<00:02:18.790> show<00:02:19.060> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
operation so that I mean I'll show you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.280 
operation so that I mean I'll show you

getting it a good angle here the glass
is<00:02:26.410> absolutely<00:02:26.950> flawless<00:02:28.230> coating<00:02:29.230> is

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
is absolutely flawless coating is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
is absolutely flawless coating is
flawless<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:32.080> been<00:02:32.230> very<00:02:32.530> well<00:02:32.710> cared<00:02:33.040> for

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.050 
flawless it's been very well cared for
and<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:36.520> really<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.060> only<00:02:37.350> condition<00:02:38.350> issue

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
and so really the only condition issue

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060 
and so really the only condition issue
with<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.300> lens<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.320> fact<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.890> has

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
with this lens is the fact that it has

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.190 
with this lens is the fact that it has
that<00:02:42.310> tight<00:02:42.640> zoom<00:02:43.950> my<00:02:45.630> feeling<00:02:46.630> on<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
that tight zoom my feeling on that is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.240 
that tight zoom my feeling on that is
that<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.560> are<00:02:49.680> somebody<00:02:50.680> who's<00:02:50.950> kind<00:02:51.160> of
