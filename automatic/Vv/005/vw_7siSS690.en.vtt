here what happens is it spins around and
the<00:01:04.350> centrifugal<00:01:04.769> force<00:01:05.189> puts<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the centrifugal force puts it to the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
the centrifugal force puts it to the
outside<00:01:05.850> makes<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.750> liquid<00:01:07.080> Tyra<00:01:07.350> liner<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
outside makes a liquid Tyra liner you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
outside makes a liquid Tyra liner you
can<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> color<00:01:08.549> difference<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.150> that
