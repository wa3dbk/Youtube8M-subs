hi everyone and welcome to our next
tutorial<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:09.000> year<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> redo<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.469> older

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
tutorial this year is a redo of an older

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.430 
tutorial this year is a redo of an older
one<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> did<00:00:11.700> well<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.389> too<00:00:12.570> old<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.230> I

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
one that I did well not too old but I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.099 
one that I did well not too old but I
did<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.950> few<00:00:14.190> months<00:00:14.400> ago<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.910> I'm<00:00:15.750> gonna<00:00:15.900> be

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
did it a few months ago and I'm gonna be

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
did it a few months ago and I'm gonna be
redoing<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.800> whole<00:00:16.980> bunch<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.310> my<00:00:17.460> tutorials

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
redoing a whole bunch of my tutorials

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120 
redoing a whole bunch of my tutorials
because<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.779> new<00:00:18.960> mic<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.680> sounds

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
because I have a new mic now it sounds

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.920 
because I have a new mic now it sounds
much<00:00:20.250> better<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> feel<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.660> get<00:00:21.779> my

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
much better and I feel like I can get my

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.340 
much better and I feel like I can get my
points<00:00:22.350> across<00:00:22.680> much<00:00:23.039> more<00:00:23.340> easily<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.359> so

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
points across much more easily now so

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500 
points across much more easily now so
here<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.400> increment<00:00:26.789> selection

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
here we have the increment selection

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
here we have the increment selection
trick<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.109> I'm<00:00:28.320> redoing<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.010> felt<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.789> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
trick which I'm redoing I felt in that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.450 
trick which I'm redoing I felt in that
tutorial<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.140> very<00:00:31.320> quiet<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.160> didn't

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
tutorial I was very quiet and I didn't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
tutorial I was very quiet and I didn't
get<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> lot<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> points<00:00:33.180> across<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.110> should

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
get a lot of points across that I should

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.350 
get a lot of points across that I should
have<00:00:34.380> gotten<00:00:34.530> across<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.000> we're<00:00:36.180> just

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
have gotten across so here we're just

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
have gotten across so here we're just
going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> learn<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.610> put<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> border

going to learn how to put a border
around<00:00:39.739> different<00:00:40.739> things<00:00:41.160> whether<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.640> be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
around different things whether it be

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.630 
around different things whether it be
letters<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.329> whatever<00:00:42.660> thing<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.500> draw<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
letters or whatever thing you draw this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
letters or whatever thing you draw this
can<00:00:44.879> go<00:00:45.030> for<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.809> anything<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.530> here

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

take the magic wand tool and select the
objects<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
objects that I would like to have a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.800 
objects that I would like to have a

border around now I'm going to click

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
border around now I'm going to click
another<00:01:22.049> tool<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
another tool just so I can see the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.590 
another tool just so I can see the
marching<00:01:23.580> ants<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:26.070> we're<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
marching ants then we're going to go to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.580 
marching ants then we're going to go to
selection<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.400> increment<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.590> notice

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
selection and then increment and notice

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.770 
selection and then increment and notice
every<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.520> selection<00:01:33.180> increment<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
every time I do selection increment I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.319 
every time I do selection increment I
get<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> larger<00:01:34.770> gap<00:01:35.009> between<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.700> object<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
get a larger gap between the object and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.810 
get a larger gap between the object and
the<00:01:36.780> marching<00:01:37.079> ants<00:01:40.340> now<00:01:41.340> we're<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.670> going

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the marching ants now we're just going

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.929 
the marching ants now we're just going
to<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.240> until<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:42.720> happy<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
to do that until we're happy with it and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.370 
to do that until we're happy with it and
here's<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.210> fine<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.540> makes<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.780> nice<00:01:45.930> border

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
here's just fine it makes a nice border

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
here's just fine it makes a nice border
then<00:01:47.250> we're<00:01:47.490> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.210> layer<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
then we're going to make a new layer and

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.319 
then we're going to make a new layer and
drag<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.470> below<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.220> original<00:01:50.820> layer<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
drag that below the original layer this

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.219 
drag that below the original layer this
is<00:01:51.540> very<00:01:51.780> important<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:54.210> take<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> black<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
is very important now take a black and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.950 
is very important now take a black and
I'm<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> use<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> large<00:01:56.640> brush<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.240> then

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I'm going to use a large brush and then

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.640 
I'm going to use a large brush and then
sweep<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.180> text

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
sweep over the text

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.060 
sweep over the text
and<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:01.400> we<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.270> nice<00:02:03.110> border<00:02:03.560> around<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
and now we have a nice border around the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.750 
and now we have a nice border around the
letters<00:02:10.060> another<00:02:11.060> option<00:02:11.570> you<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.720> do<00:02:12.050> is

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
letters another option you can do is

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.210 
letters another option you can do is
take<00:02:13.760> out<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.940> black<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.630> put<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.620> white<00:02:15.950> down

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
take out the black and put a white down

increment over and over and over until
it's<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.330> bit<00:02:32.480> larger<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.340> make<00:02:34.340> one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
it's a little bit larger and make one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.910 
it's a little bit larger and make one
more<00:02:34.850> layer<00:02:35.090> drag<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.990> below<00:02:36.290> all<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.560> the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
more layer drag that below all of the

more layer drag that below all of the
layers<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:38.320> then<00:02:39.320> take<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> black<00:02:40.010> or<00:02:40.370> whatever

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820

and then it makes a border that almost

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.380 
and then it makes a border that almost
looks<00:02:45.830> like<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.280> hovering<00:02:46.580> around<00:02:47.090> the
