00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.709 
be able to do the three note per strings
I<00:00:13.759> used<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:14.000> warm<00:00:14.240> up

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
I used to warm up

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.830 
I used to warm up
he's<00:00:15.049> guys<00:00:15.230> heard<00:00:15.440> me<00:00:15.589> do<00:00:15.710> it<00:00:15.830> every<00:00:16.009> day<00:00:16.189> with

he's guys heard me do it every day with
there's<00:00:17.840> something<00:00:18.109> that<00:00:18.230> rusty<00:00:18.560> Cooley<00:00:18.949> did

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
there's something that rusty Cooley did

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.380 
there's something that rusty Cooley did
called<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.720> legato<00:00:21.680> workout<00:00:22.189> that<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.520> swore

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
called the legato workout that I swore

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.099 
called the legato workout that I swore
by<00:00:23.600> for<00:00:23.930> for<00:00:24.260> about<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:24.470> year<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.460> it<00:00:26.109> pretty

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
by for for about a year and it pretty

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:40.439 
by for for about a year and it pretty
much<00:00:27.289> was<00:00:27.730> this<00:00:28.730> pattern

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.619 

so<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:41.199> would<00:00:41.379> do<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.789> all<00:00:43.089> your

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
so you would do that which is all your

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.899 
so you would do that which is all your

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
picking on the way up on the way

picking on the way up on the way
doing<00:00:51.370> pull<00:00:51.550> offs<00:00:51.789> and<00:00:52.059> I'm<00:00:52.180> alternate

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:26.580 

yeah<00:01:17.670> slow<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.789> down

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.040 

and<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:28.160> not<00:01:28.970> only<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.330> half<00:01:29.480> step<00:01:29.720> patterns

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
and then not only the half step patterns

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:43.950 
and then not only the half step patterns
but<00:01:30.200> every<00:01:30.530> pattern<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.980> can<00:01:31.100> think<00:01:31.370> of

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.940 
coming out of my solar record that I'm
coming<00:03:24.180> out<00:03:24.300> with<00:03:24.360> next<00:03:24.660> year<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.050> I'll<00:03:25.770> play

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
coming out with next year but I'll play

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:41.009 
coming out with next year but I'll play
it<00:03:26.040> real<00:03:26.190> slow<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.610> you

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.240 

so<00:03:42.019> it<00:03:42.110> just<00:03:42.200> repeats<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.709> pattern<00:03:43.099> but

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
so it just repeats that pattern but

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.039 
so it just repeats that pattern but
that's<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.730> like<00:03:44.330> that<00:03:44.480> exercise<00:03:44.870> because

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
that's I like that exercise because

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.479 
that's I like that exercise because
you're<00:03:45.200> alternating<00:03:45.439> strings<00:03:46.010> you're<00:03:46.280> doing

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
you're alternating strings you're doing

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.890 
you're alternating strings you're doing
your<00:03:46.610> downs<00:03:46.879> you're<00:03:47.209> focusing<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.599> your<00:03:47.750> down

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
your downs you're focusing on your down

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.319 
your downs you're focusing on your down
strokes<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.439> your<00:03:48.890> got<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.849> gallops<00:03:50.180> in

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
strokes just your got the gallops in

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.259 
strokes just your got the gallops in
there<00:03:51.610> only<00:03:52.610> thing<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.849> don't<00:03:52.939> have<00:03:53.030> it's

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
there only thing you don't have it's

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.610 
there only thing you don't have it's
just<00:03:53.420> a<00:03:53.510> straight<00:03:53.720> alternate<00:03:54.110> picking<00:03:54.319> but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
just a straight alternate picking but

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.050 
just a straight alternate picking but
that's<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.250> kind<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.459> thing<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.700> like<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.970> do

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
that's the kind of thing I like to do

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.729 
that's the kind of thing I like to do
before<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.360> get<00:03:56.450> on<00:03:56.689> for<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.110> show<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.440> make<00:03:57.590> sure

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
before I get on for a show and make sure

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.680 
before I get on for a show and make sure
my<00:03:57.950> my<00:03:58.250> right<00:03:58.459> hand<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:58.790> for<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.540> rhythm

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
my my right hand is going for the rhythm

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:07.149 
my my right hand is going for the rhythm
stuff<00:04:01.599> now<00:04:02.599> for<00:04:03.500> my<00:04:03.709> left<00:04:03.950> hand<00:04:04.220> stuff<00:04:05.799> I'll<00:04:06.799> go

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
stuff now for my left hand stuff I'll go

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.509 
stuff now for my left hand stuff I'll go
through<00:04:07.430> patterns<00:04:07.670> of<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.930> know<00:04:09.519> diatonic

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
through patterns of you know diatonic

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.170 
through patterns of you know diatonic
modal<00:04:11.180> shapes<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.810> just<00:04:12.140> kind<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:13.180> go

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
modal shapes and just kind of go

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:31.650 
modal shapes and just kind of go
wherever<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:14.569> takes<00:04:14.750> me

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.090 

it<00:04:32.590> was<00:04:32.710> kind<00:04:32.920> of<00:04:32.980> flow<00:04:33.790> around<00:04:34.000> wherever<00:04:34.300> and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
it was kind of flow around wherever and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.560 
it was kind of flow around wherever and
you<00:04:36.100> know<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.520> do<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.180> have<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.450> learn

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
you know to do that you have to learn

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.720 
you know to do that you have to learn
your<00:04:37.780> obviously<00:04:38.770> your<00:04:38.920> modal<00:04:39.190> shapes<00:04:39.460> and

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
your obviously your modal shapes and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:51.800 
your obviously your modal shapes and
just<00:04:41.850> switch<00:04:42.850> out<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.240> pattern<00:04:43.540> I'm<00:04:43.660> using<00:04:43.900> is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.920 

when<00:04:52.590> I'm<00:04:52.710> switching<00:04:53.100> between<00:04:53.510> shapes<00:04:54.510> on<00:04:54.750> one

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
when I'm switching between shapes on one

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.380 
when I'm switching between shapes on one
string<00:04:55.260> I'm<00:04:55.590> just

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.690 

so<00:05:04.390> if<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.540> learn<00:05:04.690> that<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:06.430> know<00:05:06.550> that

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
so if you learn that you know that

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.190 
so if you learn that you know that
routine<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.210> can<00:05:07.360> float<00:05:07.600> all<00:05:07.750> over<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:08.050> neck

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
routine you can float all over the neck

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.600 
routine you can float all over the neck
and<00:05:08.350> any<00:05:08.440> three<00:05:08.650> no<00:05:08.770> four<00:05:08.830> string<00:05:09.100> pattern<00:05:09.460> and

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and any three no four string pattern and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.240 
and any three no four string pattern and
get<00:05:10.150> your<00:05:10.300> left<00:05:10.450> hand<00:05:11.190> raring<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.250> go<00:05:14.250> for

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
get your left hand raring to go for

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.970 
get your left hand raring to go for
picking<00:05:15.820> for<00:05:16.810> leek<00:05:16.990> kind<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.380> picking<00:05:17.710> stuff

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
picking for leek kind of picking stuff

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.420 
picking for leek kind of picking stuff
I'll<00:05:18.610> start<00:05:19.570> with<00:05:19.750> single<00:05:20.650> string<00:05:20.860> ideas<00:05:21.220> and

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
I'll start with single string ideas and

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.050 
I'll start with single string ideas and
one<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.580> always<00:05:21.820> go<00:05:22.060> back<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.510> is<00:05:23.790> you<00:05:24.790> probably

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
one I always go back to is you probably

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:40.020 
one I always go back to is you probably
recognize<00:05:25.390> it<00:05:25.540> as<00:05:25.630> like<00:05:25.780> Aang<00:05:25.930> banality<00:05:39.030> and

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
recognize it as like Aang banality and

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.390 
recognize it as like Aang banality and
and<00:05:40.720> you<00:05:40.840> can<00:05:40.960> just<00:05:41.110> float<00:05:41.350> you<00:05:41.890> know<00:05:42.010> I'll

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
and you can just float you know I'll

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:52.760 
and you can just float you know I'll
take<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:42.760> up<00:05:42.910> to<00:05:43.600> three<00:05:43.780> different<00:05:43.870> positions

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:05.980 

so<00:05:53.770> up<00:05:53.890> to<00:05:54.040> speed

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.890 

so<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:07.490> saw<00:06:07.669> I<00:06:07.699> went<00:06:07.970> through<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.360> strings<00:06:08.690> an

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
so you saw I went through the strings an

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.270 
so you saw I went through the strings an
easy<00:06:09.020> way<00:06:09.259> to<00:06:09.759> for<00:06:10.759> me<00:06:10.970> to<00:06:11.470> play<00:06:12.470> picking<00:06:12.979> fast

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
easy way to for me to play picking fast

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.640 
easy way to for me to play picking fast
through<00:06:13.639> multiple<00:06:14.569> strings<00:06:14.870> as<00:06:15.139> to<00:06:15.289> picking

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
through multiple strings as to picking

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.680 
through multiple strings as to picking
in<00:06:15.800> seven<00:06:16.580> so<00:06:16.699> you're<00:06:16.789> starting<00:06:17.090> on<00:06:17.150> five<00:06:17.449> on

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
in seven so you're starting on five on

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:18.580 
in seven so you're starting on five on
the<00:06:17.780> first<00:06:17.990> string<00:06:18.199> and<00:06:18.319> then<00:06:18.410> picking

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
the first string and then picking

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.779 
the first string and then picking
through<00:06:18.830> seven<00:06:19.130> is<00:06:19.220> going<00:06:19.400> down<00:06:19.520> through<00:06:19.699> the

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
through seven is going down through the

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.029 
through seven is going down through the
strings<00:06:20.090> it's<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:20.900> same<00:06:21.139> pattern<00:06:21.590> you<00:06:21.919> would

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
strings it's the same pattern you would

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.439 
strings it's the same pattern you would
use<00:06:23.410> as<00:06:24.410> if<00:06:25.310> you're<00:06:25.490> just<00:06:25.669> playing<00:06:25.789> legato<00:06:26.030> so

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
use as if you're just playing legato so

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:36.339 
use as if you're just playing legato so
it's<00:06:26.770> one<00:06:27.770> two<00:06:27.800> three<00:06:27.979> four<00:06:28.340> five<00:06:34.660> so<00:06:35.660> you'd<00:06:36.229> be

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
it's one two three four five so you'd be

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.430 
it's one two three four five so you'd be
playing<00:06:36.880> phrases<00:06:37.880> or<00:06:38.030> patterns<00:06:38.930> of<00:06:39.020> seven

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
playing phrases or patterns of seven

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.990 
playing phrases or patterns of seven
unless<00:06:39.650> you're<00:06:40.430> shifting<00:06:40.789> if<00:06:40.909> you're

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
unless you're shifting if you're

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:53.050 
unless you're shifting if you're
shifting<00:06:41.330> you're<00:06:41.479> going<00:06:41.599> to<00:06:41.659> go<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:41.810> five<00:06:42.080> so

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.120 

another<00:06:53.449> picking<00:06:53.870> thing<00:06:54.050> I<00:06:54.139> like<00:06:54.289> to<00:06:54.410> do<00:06:54.560> using

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
another picking thing I like to do using

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.210 
another picking thing I like to do using
two<00:06:55.430> strings<00:06:56.229> I'll<00:06:57.229> play<00:06:57.440> slow<00:06:57.710> first<00:06:57.979> is

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
two strings I'll play slow first is

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:06.100 
two strings I'll play slow first is
going<00:07:03.190> and<00:07:04.190> with<00:07:05.090> that<00:07:05.240> pattern<00:07:05.630> you<00:07:05.660> can<00:07:05.870> take

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
going and with that pattern you can take

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:18.090 
going and with that pattern you can take
it<00:07:06.289> you<00:07:06.590> know<00:07:06.620> all<00:07:06.860> through<00:07:07.069> E<00:07:07.099> minor

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:33.980 

so<00:07:19.100> that<00:07:19.280> up

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.219 

so<00:07:34.990> within<00:07:35.979> those<00:07:36.360> three<00:07:37.360> things<00:07:37.660> I<00:07:37.930> think<00:07:37.960> the

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:38.229 
so within those three things I think the

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:40.830 
so within those three things I think the
picking<00:07:38.590> hand<00:07:38.740> is<00:07:39.010> nice<00:07:39.699> and<00:07:39.880> warmed<00:07:40.150> up<00:07:40.270> and

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
picking hand is nice and warmed up and

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.930 
picking hand is nice and warmed up and
the<00:07:41.740> legato<00:07:42.040> hand<00:07:42.250> I<00:07:42.310> went<00:07:42.460> over<00:07:42.580> lookout<00:07:42.820> as

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:42.940 
the legato hand I went over lookout as

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.710 
the legato hand I went over lookout as
well<00:07:43.120> but<00:07:44.010> that's<00:07:45.010> pretty<00:07:45.790> much<00:07:45.910> gets<00:07:46.540> me

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
well but that's pretty much gets me
