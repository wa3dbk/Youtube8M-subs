with<00:00:13.500> holographic<00:00:13.950> i<00:00:14.340> use<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.590> whatever<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
with holographic i use the whatever the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.599 
with holographic i use the whatever the
thing<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.100> where<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.699> shot<00:00:19.010> then<00:00:20.010> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
thing is where if you get shot then you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.820 
thing is where if you get shot then you
don't<00:00:20.850> lose<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.990> reduce<00:00:22.260> recoil<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.710> you

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
don't lose you reduce recoil when you

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.470 
don't lose you reduce recoil when you
getting<00:00:22.980> shot<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> sign<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.550> use<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.180> one

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
getting shot a sign I use that one

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300 
getting shot a sign I use that one
because<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.810> helps<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.439> winning<00:00:25.859> shot

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
because that helps a lot winning shot

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
because that helps a lot winning shot

earlier which I'll talk about in a
second<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.510> steady<00:00:39.930> aim<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
second and steady aim just because I

hipfire sometimes and you want to use a
specialized<00:00:44.550> killstreak<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
specialized killstreak now what this is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.229

at 246 you get kills you get extra perks
right<00:00:52.070> at<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:53.309> unifirst<00:00:53.789> before<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
right at two unifirst before you get a

right at two unifirst before you get a
second<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.410> six<00:00:55.559> year<00:00:55.710> third<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.399> because

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
second and six year third but because

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.930 
second and six year third but because
you<00:00:56.789> use<00:00:57.239> hardline<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.230> 135<00:00:59.070> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you use hardline you get it at 135 so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
you use hardline you get it at 135 so
every<00:01:00.239> kill<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.530> unlock<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:02.039> extra

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
perk and because it's like a killstreak

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
perk and because it's like a killstreak
you<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.850> extra<00:01:06.119> points<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.720> getting<00:01:07.350> this

you get extra points for getting this
perk<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.920> again<00:01:08.580> instead<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> getting<00:01:09.689> kill

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
perk and again instead of getting kill

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
perk and again instead of getting kill

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
being 100 it becomes about 300 or 400

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.679 
being 100 it becomes about 300 or 400
points<00:01:12.600> per<00:01:12.990> kill<00:01:13.260> which<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.130> very<00:01:14.310> helpful

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and I've set it up so as you progress

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.070 
and I've set it up so as you progress
through<00:01:18.869> getting<00:01:19.229> kills<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:20.549> kit<00:01:21.540> helps<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
through getting kills your kit helps you

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.420 
through getting kills your kit helps you
get<00:01:22.229> kills<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:22.979> based<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.250> kill

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
get kills but it's not based on kill

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
get kills but it's not based on kill
streaks<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.299> first<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.840> scavenger<00:01:25.290> pro

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
streaks so first one is scavenger pro

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.310 
streaks so first one is scavenger pro
which<00:01:26.040> means<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.430> walk<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.960> MO

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
which means you can walk you get more MO

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
which means you can walk you get more MO
as<00:01:28.799> soon<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> you'll<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.970> more

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
as soon as you get it you'll get more

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
as soon as you get it you'll get more
ammo<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> full<00:01:31.229> block<00:01:31.560> ammo<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
ammo but you get a full block ammo and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
ammo but you get a full block ammo and
when<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.939> weren't<00:01:33.119> everybody's<00:01:33.329> you're

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
when you weren't everybody's you're

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.300 
when you weren't everybody's you're
picking<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.900> amber<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.799> after<00:01:35.009> you've<00:01:35.100> gotten

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
picking up amber so after you've gotten

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.770 
picking up amber so after you've gotten
one<00:01:35.460> kill<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.850> eventually<00:01:35.970> start<00:01:36.450> running<00:01:36.720> at

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
one kill you eventually start running at

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
one kill you eventually start running at
a<00:01:36.960> moan<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.710> getting<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> so

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
a moan you want to be getting it and so

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
a moan you want to be getting it and so
it<00:01:38.880> saves<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.299> picking<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.659> another<00:01:39.840> gun<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it saves from picking up another gun the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
it saves from picking up another gun the
second<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.840> quick-draw<00:01:42.840> approach<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.320> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
second one is quick-draw approach me to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
second one is quick-draw approach me to
get<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.619> zoom<00:01:43.799> down<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.340> sights<00:01:44.520> faster<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
get to zoom down your sights faster this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
get to zoom down your sights faster this
is<00:01:45.659> better<00:01:45.899> when<00:01:46.110> there's<00:01:46.700> clothes<00:01:47.700> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
is better when there's clothes in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.819 
is better when there's clothes in
quarters<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> Quick<00:01:49.170> Reaction<00:01:49.290> stuff
