00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 or well this one obviously that in the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.220
 When they called me, they explained the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.849
 club situation 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.789
 in the sports and good part we will try 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.990
 maybe so that cÃºcuta stays in 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.170
 the first good vision 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.470
 I liked the proposal was wanting 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.110
 again to leave Uruguay and good 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 we are also sanguinetti and he told me 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.849
 that spoke very well of the club that good 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.440
 that there was a moment going by 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.700
 little special 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.950
 this was a nice chance to not hesitate and 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 well that obviously take the chance 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.790
 to come with the quality as an archer the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.400
 you are going to see you match match 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.730
 they are going to tell you but typical 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.730
 Uruguayan goalkeeper 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.110
 and good the trajectory of the player 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.450
 the Uruguayan obviously the paraguay game 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.110
 with ecuador and good is the first 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.480
 soccer experience preselection 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.930
 I was in all the mint a theme 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.930
 of injuries 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:13.060
 about the time that outside in the sub-20 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.800
 but good this state and I know what 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 that what is in the situation does not 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.980
 obviously wish him the best and put more 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.160
 quickly aimed for good for 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.870
 to be at the team's command and be able 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.810
 give the best but obviously what 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.310
 in the group as I already said try to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.270
 take the team forward of the situation 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.970
 it is always personal 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.960
 you want the best not to try to do the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.720
 things as well as possible and good that 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.970
 that they see it they see it with good eyes 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.410
 good the Colombian soccer to uruguay 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 we arrived well by the chains 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:55.070
 international this out there I've known 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.600
 he knows one more when he has a friend 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.220
 that if some team but I have a 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.790
 General screenshot no no no I'm not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.790
