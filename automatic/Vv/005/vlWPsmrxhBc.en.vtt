00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.889
 Hello ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.580
 to make a dough buzz very simple to do 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 and she's going to be used to pass for 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 several preparations like pizzas 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 the daffodils was just going the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.690
 bread know it bread bakery 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 we all have that regarding the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.370
 occasions this one that gives this result 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.379
 in fact it does not turn very light very 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 good to eat 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 she is really very good so this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.059
 dough 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.840
 this attack is prepared in two stages 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.840
 the first step 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.300
 we need for the first stage of the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.050
 flour salt yeast and sugar olot 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.750
 once flexible and the second step one 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.680
 needs the oil flour 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.670
 vegetable 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:18.119
 I took the olive oil is 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 hung then we will start again 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.649
 so here I was ingredients for a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.930
 kilo of flour 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.450
 today I had prepared bread but 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.310
 for example if you want to prepare a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.140
 salty preparation based on this paste 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.690
 frankly 700 g is enough then we do not 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.050
 that a very early in the noise of course 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.600
 if you do not have trouble just 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.600
 with hands that makes me very well there 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.780
 al sadd sugar and yeast 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:10.690
