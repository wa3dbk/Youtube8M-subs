00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
lifting and why did I start up again

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
lifting and why did I start up again
well<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> main<00:01:55.200> reason<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.740> i<00:01:56.070> wanted<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
well the main reason is i wanted to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.690 
well the main reason is i wanted to
because<00:01:57.770> I'm<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> age<00:01:59.460> where<00:01:59.670> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
because I'm kind of at the age where I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.039 
because I'm kind of at the age where I
don't<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.119> do<00:02:00.299> anything<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:00.719> want<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
don't really do anything I don't want to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.670 
don't really do anything I don't want to
do<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> anymore<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.969> I<00:02:04.399> wanted<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
do it anymore and I wanted to

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.010 
do it anymore and I wanted to
but<00:02:07.580> there's<00:02:07.880> other<00:02:08.000> factors<00:02:08.240> involved<00:02:08.750> I

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
but there's other factors involved I

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.770 
but there's other factors involved I
wanted<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.150> there's<00:02:11.150> weights<00:02:11.480> right

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
wanted to and there's weights right

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.390 
wanted to and there's weights right
outside<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.320> Academy<00:02:12.410> there's<00:02:13.040> weights<00:02:13.250> at

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
outside the Academy there's weights at

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.660 
outside the Academy there's weights at
the<00:02:13.520> academy<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.490> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the academy so I have the I have the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.450 
the academy so I have the I have the
schedule<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:19.010> just<00:02:19.160> go<00:02:19.370> to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
schedule to do that so I can just go to

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.890 
schedule to do that so I can just go to
class<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.210> know<00:02:21.160> 30<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.550> 45<00:02:23.120> minutes<00:02:23.360> earlier

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
class you know 30 to 45 minutes earlier

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.570

than normal and get a get a lift in

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.220 
than normal and get a get a lift in
that's<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.820> reason<00:02:29.740> another<00:02:30.740> reason<00:02:30.980> is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that's one reason another reason is

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.050 
that's one reason another reason is
