00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.460
 do on the dm card from top to bottom and on 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.020
 we put it just a ring finger on 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.480

 top down 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.540
 after which we put a chord d em and play 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.690
 battle four with jamming but instead 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.720
 first strike top down play bass 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.720
 strings 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.990
 mean up from you 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.110
 the pad of your index finger then 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.070
 silenced and again upward pillows 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.250
 Directions ballz so you get up 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.510
 jam up then alternate bass 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.050
 the string is already the fifth 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 play 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.000
 This fight is the same as 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.210
 previous if tally since 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.570
 once on each chord only if 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.420
 you notice changing rhythm and tempo 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.580
 accelerates and adds one chord fa 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:19.380
 and before him bass is added 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.780
 which is shown in chord fingering 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.790
 I hope all this has helped I wish you 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.790
