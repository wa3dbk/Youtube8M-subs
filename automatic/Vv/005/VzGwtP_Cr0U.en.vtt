aspect<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.820> let's<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.090> through<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> pig<00:01:16.549> one

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
aspect to so let's go through a pig one

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.950 
aspect to so let's go through a pig one
inch<00:01:17.900> let's<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> sheep<00:01:20.630> -<00:01:21.630> it's

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.670 

probably<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.140> probably<00:01:25.320> equivalent<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
probably it's probably equivalent to a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.960 
probably it's probably equivalent to a
wait<00:01:28.680> let<00:01:28.829> me<00:01:28.860> exit<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.369> save<00:01:29.400> real<00:01:29.790> quick

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it in survival mode and see if it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.230

actually<00:01:37.079> does<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.829> damage<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:39.090> was

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
actually does take damage it was

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
actually does take damage it was
actually<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> cool<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.680> it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually kind of a cool thing to do it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.440 
actually kind of a cool thing to do it's
actually<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.220> glitch<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> game<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.390> now

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I think I'm not sure if you can actually

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
I think I'm not sure if you can actually
do<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> while<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.979> have
