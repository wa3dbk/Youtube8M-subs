00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.930
 here we see the Khat 4 620 which appeared in the fourth quarter of 2009 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.779
 and we'll have a different look at Dukes 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.150
 you have to take out of the packaging 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 then I notice that it is the setting that comes to me very deeply 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 it feels weird 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.279
 but this is mainly because it is a slider phone that is 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.519
 I can do it for you 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.310
 bounce on each other 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.900
 that's why it's a bit thicker but a complete one 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.250
 qwerty keyboard 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.610
 here is the phone Galati raves now even without the current is 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.880
 Course not without 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.250
 weighs with battery is 142 grams 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.690
 who will give me a 3-inch display 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 and the dimensions are 100 9 mm May 54 mm 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.850
 May 17 millimeters 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.550
 In addition, the operating system on the smartphone again 1 point 5 degrees 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.760
 enter Chapeau Claque installed 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.200
 this is the first lã¼thi smartphone with 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.190
 android operating system 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.660
 already a margin from the outside can see everything 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.670
 we have the switch to turn it on and off up here 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.510
 for the key lock 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.260
 then we have the input for headphones with 3 comma here 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.150
 5-millimeter-phone jack 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.170
 we have an eyelet for key chains and so on 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.410
 Aalen on the right we have the cover here under a protective wall 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.060
 the input for percent the Miku Cata map 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.120
 we have fast buttons here but for the music player 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.230
 Aalen and once the movie camera disturbs function and exclusion of course 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.810
 besides, here on the left side we have the entrance hidden under these 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.810
 for the micro SBK would 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 It will look like that 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.090
 and then we have the volume control here 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.759
 on the back have like a 5-megapixel camera 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.759
 and one suffered the places 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.429
 then we have this name here 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.039
 Touchscreen will have two buttons 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.729
 which also Germany 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.159
 and then we have a pop of snap here 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.549
 The smartphone costs about 250 euros, we'll see what's included 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.299
 is included 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.299
 Here we have the account 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.919
 they have as well 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:47.359
 to charge the adapter around to the Hako here it works and to say 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.159
 went wrong 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.459
 is definitely sporty but out 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.299
 Stefan Kneer together 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.349
 and that comes food here 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.979
 be in those days 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.979
 for Disney Coesfeld 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.189
 so you can then recharge the battery once 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.989
 directly at the socket or on the PC 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.139
 in the end it crashed 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.159
 Of course, this can also be used for data transfer 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:25.999
 In addition, have on his head and Heiko Maas 5 millimeters Kim Clijsters 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
 Hindu Kush 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.459
 and here we have 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.999
 to change a small button around such feature 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.219
 are included Luis Sanz makes the manual of course 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.529
 I only listen to the Taq once 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:46.620
 use 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.620
 that damaged the cap 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.539
 then the battery reaches our destination 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.269
 the battery cover that 'good' decrease that everything works very well 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.799
 so far 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.669
 to the first impression
