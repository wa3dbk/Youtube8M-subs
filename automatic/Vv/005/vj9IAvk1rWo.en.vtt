it this pipe will start to drain now
I've<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.380> already<00:01:25.740> done<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.610> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
I've actually already done this so that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
I've actually already done this so that
most<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> gasoline<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.170> already<00:01:28.380> drained<00:01:28.619> out

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
most the gasoline is already drained out

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
most the gasoline is already drained out
of<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.250> now<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> should<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.200> container

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
of this now you should have a container

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.010 
of this now you should have a container
underneath<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.799> catch<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.369> gasoline<00:01:33.020> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
underneath to catch the gasoline but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.609 
underneath to catch the gasoline but
you'll<00:01:34.170> undo<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.759> unscrew<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.170> gas<00:01:37.350> will

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you'll undo this unscrew it the gas will

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.020 
you'll undo this unscrew it the gas will
drain<00:01:37.920> it'll<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.430> come<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.820> quite

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
drain it'll actually come out and quite

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.370 
drain it'll actually come out and quite
a<00:01:39.060> gush<00:01:39.299> there's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> fair<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.200> there

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
a gush there's a fair bit of it in there

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.350 
a gush there's a fair bit of it in there
so<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> container<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.729> catch<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so use a container to catch it and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
so use a container to catch it and
that's<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.380> done<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:44.549> you're

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670

done you simply go up here to make sure
all<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> gases<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.720> into<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> top<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
all the gases out you go into the top of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.310 
all the gases out you go into the top of
this<00:01:52.500> little<00:01:52.680> device<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> push<00:01:53.820> down

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
this little device here and push down

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.539 
this little device here and push down
that<00:01:55.320> object<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> use<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> different

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
that object I'm going to use a different

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.569 
that object I'm going to use a different
screwdriver<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.250> get<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> bit

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
screwdriver so they can get it a bit

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.460 
screwdriver so they can get it a bit
deeper<00:01:59.969> than<00:02:00.299> that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.110 

and<00:02:06.160> what<00:02:06.310> that'll<00:02:06.460> do<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.640> we'll<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:06.970> let

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
and what that'll do is we'll just let

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.190 
and what that'll do is we'll just let
air<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.570> let<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> drain<00:02:08.470> properly<00:02:10.050> when<00:02:11.050> you're

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
air in let it drain properly when you're

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.010 
air in let it drain properly when you're
done<00:02:11.410> simply<00:02:12.340> replace<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.240> cap<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.750> just<00:02:13.930> a
