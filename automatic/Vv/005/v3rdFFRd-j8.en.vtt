00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.389
 I'm here to teach you how to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.849
 to move in this program is 3 photos slideshow 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:16.820
 very easy to mess the promoter is quiet 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.949
 and I'm downloading a photo of you 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 put there for you to learn 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.510
 You can put the picture as you can. 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.170
 to put even does not have does not have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.179
 problem will put a photo and put 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.200
 this photo you can put one is made 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.399
 placing a high zoom with the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.739
 to the right that will be 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.350
 placed to carry the team did not 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 load this game 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 filled in green which can increase the time 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.870
 the photo or video you want to put a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 headdress in the photo to get a square 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 A little easier to put in the picture goes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.120
 fill it and then you will see how it goes 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 stay 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 you will see that the slide it has 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 movement from left to right and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.049
 Then you can deal with it backwards 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.049
 from here on 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.930
 in all these 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 it is in these chips there the high use is also 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.220
 Pretty nice back to front you can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.240
 put the type of image type format 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.180
 that you want 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.729
 is one of the effects they have here also has 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.280
 picture discolored effect 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.780
 It's been really cool, you gotta 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.320
 stir in each effect in this second option 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.610
 said 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.190
 besides ex you can also add 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:51.350
 texts are placing then placing 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:55.520
 no other test title and there in that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.170

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.750

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.750
 so the subject can put several 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.119

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.519
