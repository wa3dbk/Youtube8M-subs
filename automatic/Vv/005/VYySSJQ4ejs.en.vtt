00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 plus 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:08.230
 sports segment in the nude city 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.809
 and what we want 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.000
 a little defend the common citizen of 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:19.060
 all the free empty information that 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.520
 they give us permanently not only the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.680
 sports portals but very many 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
 TV channels very many 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.910
 news that as Carlos says they have to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.060
 fill spaces if they were really 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.460
 laconic the sports commentary not 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.440
 would last not even a tenth of what 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.540
 these programs last today 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.060
 we wanted to extract for example from the play 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.480
 football this is a 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.629
 Publication of the nation's oil paintings 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.420
 play football 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.010
 I do not think I think it's worth I think of infobae 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.550
 exactly then here is a 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 story anywhere there are comments from 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.110
 important teams or players that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 make their declarations given that the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:09.150
 journalists demand that you say something here 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.180
 we have already today July 7 July 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.619
 July 2013 of 2013 we have 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.590
 statements for example of the burrito 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.570
 martínez an app a very successful player 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.200
 instead of moving to vocal corinthians or 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 buy a figure of 3 million in the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 club coffers because it's okay but 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.509
 it was worth breaking the sanchis 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.060
 exactly we are not bringing 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 really a player's luxury and then 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 what martínez tells us when 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 it's bought mouth gave me the opportunity and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 the best thing is to thank with good goals 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.690
 this he said keep the burrito on 27 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.950
 January now or is ungrateful or is 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.860
 tackling the goals with the second 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.620
 semester 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.140
 but it's a statement that made him 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.150
 think that when you pay a lot for 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.490
 best trees 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.350
 it still does not yet make wish martin 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.200
 perfect then we have another statement 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.590
 de gareca made on February 28 we 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.039
 He says 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.780
 of the bianchi mouth team is the most 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.759
 mighty of our football 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.250
 a person like organic who sees the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.080
 football of a family very well took off 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.080
 vélez champion many times bone that 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.030
 clues comments show what 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.000
 you know does not make any sense 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.060
 that we lose a second analyzing the 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.130
 pre championships statements analyzing 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.910
 transfers well the title garcía 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.640
 a racing title garcia said no bar 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.830
 if it's not I'm rotten from that news 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.670
 earn extra time the city ​​naked 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.010
 to protect them so they do not spend 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.819
 they go with their children to the square see if 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.030
 do not name them leave leave the viewer 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.790
 to decide what to do with your dense and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.780
 we want to finish this block with a 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.980
 good news 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.370
 some doubted it some said look 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.630
 that sometimes the hymn sings to me and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.870
 they asked messi is really argentinian 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.959
 and there you do not have to look for the game of 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.959
 birth 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.010
 we are not do not invite us to try they said 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.860
 that was Argentine Uruguayan French that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.360
 it's at the end Messi is Argentinian and the 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.370
 Argentine has sometimes confirmed 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.190
 confirmed and look here I'll give you the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.990
 sequence and in that sequence we're going to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.210
 detect when we know what it is 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.510
 Argentinian has to do with this 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.750
 imputation he had in Spain for a 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.660
 supposed tax fraud 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.980
 the word supposed carlos month and there 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.000
 is following the sequences the 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.570
 holders imputed for tax fraud 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.940
 month and that says it's a campaign there's a 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.840
 campaign against me because here 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.600
 Argentine Messina demonstrates that it is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.870
 Argentine to the core I do not care 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.590
 if you do not sing the anthem and then the title 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.140
 that closes this news I paid 10 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.140
 million euros and you want to reach a 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:23.959
 agreement rectified his statements 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.959
 juries of the years 2010 and 2011 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.220
 it's a distraction or not surely 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.530
 surely supposed curfews 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.660
 as if it were an intentionality of 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.220
 defraud a tax office that I'm sure 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.090
 that these ten million euros that 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.440
 He did not pay but he wanted to give 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.410
 finished the conflict 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.820
 maybe pro terminal conflict in that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.780
 sense because it is a person 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:00.610
 It gives off money 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.820
 but it is true tax capabilities 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.810
 told him we're perfect we fight until 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.790
 the final day said that those 10 million 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.110
 can help many people though 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.570
 we have the declarations 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.030
 Impeccable juries, I will not pay 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.120
 and I'm going to rectify them so that they falsified 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.940
 his affidavit putting income 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.130
 nonexistent in order to pay more for 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:29.669
 have to pay more how nice is that 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.669
 gesture month and proud of messi mess 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.500
 or
