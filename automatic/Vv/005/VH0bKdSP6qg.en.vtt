00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
strum all the strings like this for

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:51.180 
strum all the strings like this for
example

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.220 

that<00:00:51.969> was<00:00:52.090> just<00:00:52.269> a<00:00:52.359> few<00:00:52.539> examples<00:00:53.050> of<00:00:53.170> some

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
that was just a few examples of some

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.830 
that was just a few examples of some
different<00:00:53.620> chords<00:00:54.129> and<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.609> course<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.719> more

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
different chords and of course the more

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.990 
different chords and of course the more
chords<00:00:56.230> you<00:00:56.350> know<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:57.010> more<00:00:57.190> flexibility

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
chords you know the more flexibility

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.279 
chords you know the more flexibility
you're<00:00:58.210> going<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.420> have<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.780> be<00:00:58.899> able<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.140> play

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
you're going to have to be able to play

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.319 
you're going to have to be able to play
a<00:00:59.320> variety<00:00:59.710> of<00:00:59.949> different<00:01:00.160> songs<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.909> I<00:01:01.089> think

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
a variety of different songs so I think

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.029 
a variety of different songs so I think
it<00:01:01.570> goes<00:01:01.719> without<00:01:01.989> saying<00:01:02.350> that<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.860> better

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
it goes without saying that it's better

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.219 
it goes without saying that it's better
to<00:01:03.159> learn<00:01:03.399> as<00:01:03.610> many<00:01:03.940> chords<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.479> possible<00:01:04.989> and

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
to learn as many chords as possible and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.170 
to learn as many chords as possible and
and<00:01:05.740> then<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.369> have<00:01:06.460> got<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.759> ability

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
and then you really have got the ability

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.450 
and then you really have got the ability
to<00:01:07.210> play<00:01:07.540> more<00:01:07.869> things<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.530> especially<00:01:09.310> if

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
to play more things and especially if

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.770 
to play more things and especially if
you're<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.850> sort<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.090> person<00:01:10.450> who<00:01:10.479> enjoys

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
you're the sort of person who enjoys

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.170 
you're the sort of person who enjoys
singing<00:01:11.170> as<00:01:11.530> well<00:01:11.560> as<00:01:11.860> playing<00:01:12.100> then<00:01:12.700> chords

lots<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:39.039> songs<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.640> it's<00:01:40.090> important<00:01:40.569> that<00:01:40.600> you

learn<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:45.039> more<00:01:45.190> chords<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.819> you<00:01:46.149> know

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
learn more and more chords and you know

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.480 
learn more and more chords and you know
we<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.170> go<00:01:47.319> from<00:01:47.500> there<00:01:47.740> but<00:01:48.100> let's<00:01:48.280> start

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
we can go from there but let's start

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.490 
we can go from there but let's start
simple<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.299> want<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.690> begin<00:01:49.810> by<00:01:50.020> showing<00:01:50.319> you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
simple so I want to begin by showing you

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.919 
simple so I want to begin by showing you
the<00:01:50.649> e<00:01:50.679> chord<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.819> if<00:01:52.149> you<00:01:52.330> take<00:01:52.509> your<00:01:52.569> first

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
the e chord so if you take your first

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.109 
the e chord so if you take your first
finger<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:53.649> put<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.100> onto<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.460> third<00:01:54.700> string

diagram you know if you just need to
clarify<00:02:10.209> exactly<00:02:11.110> where<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.349> notes<00:02:11.560> go<00:02:11.830> now

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
clarify exactly where the notes go now

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.010 
clarify exactly where the notes go now
why<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.819> ask<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.270> do<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.629> hold<00:02:13.840> down

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
why can I ask you to do is hold down

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.410 
why can I ask you to do is hold down
with<00:02:14.410> plenty<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.890> pressure<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.550> strum<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
with plenty of pressure and strum the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.440 
with plenty of pressure and strum the
strings

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.510 

now<00:02:19.810> ideally<00:02:20.530> all<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.890> those<00:02:21.040> notes<00:02:21.310> are

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
now ideally all of those notes are

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.250 
now ideally all of those notes are
saying<00:02:21.730> nice<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.180> clear<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.110> to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
saying nice and clear like that but to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.140 
saying nice and clear like that but to
be<00:02:23.379> honest<00:02:23.650> I'd<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:24.010> surprised<00:02:24.519> if<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.879> get<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.350 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it
signing<00:02:25.390> perfect<00:02:25.959> straight<00:02:26.230> away<00:02:26.470> it'd<00:02:27.400> be

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
signing perfect straight away it'd be

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.970 
signing perfect straight away it'd be
perfectly<00:02:28.810> normal<00:02:29.170> if<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.349> sounded<00:02:29.680> more<00:02:29.709> like

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
perfectly normal if it sounded more like

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.040 
perfectly normal if it sounded more like
this<00:02:31.590> first<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:33.459> let<00:02:33.670> me<00:02:33.760> explain<00:02:34.209> some

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
this first now let me explain some

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.690 
this first now let me explain some
common<00:02:35.260> mistakes<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.980> people<00:02:36.190> make<00:02:36.519> when

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
common mistakes that people make when

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.490 
common mistakes that people make when
learning<00:02:36.760> chords<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.959> need<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.200> do<00:02:38.349> is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
learning chords what you need to do is

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.930 
learning chords what you need to do is
make<00:02:38.709> sure<00:02:38.739> you're<00:02:39.160> holding<00:02:39.340> down<00:02:39.670> with<00:02:39.849> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
make sure you're holding down with the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.400 
make sure you're holding down with the
tip<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.180> your<00:02:40.360> finger<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.989> plenty<00:02:41.380> of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
tip of your finger with plenty of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.500 
tip of your finger with plenty of
pressure<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.099> you<00:02:42.160> need<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.849> arch<00:02:43.090> these

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
pressure and you need to arch these

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.479 
pressure and you need to arch these
fingers<00:02:43.989> up<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.530> reason<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.220> is

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
fingers up and the reason for that is

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.339 
fingers up and the reason for that is
because<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.150> want<00:02:46.480> plenty<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:47.019> space

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
because you want plenty of space

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.380 
because you want plenty of space
underneath<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.099> fingers<00:02:48.549> what<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.180> don't

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
underneath the fingers what we don't

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.059 
underneath the fingers what we don't
want<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.720> happen<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:50.170> for<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.620> back<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.950> these

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
want to happen is for the back of these

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.400 
want to happen is for the back of these
fingers<00:02:51.489> accidentally<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.510> touch<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.140> next

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
fingers accidentally to touch the next

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.339 
fingers accidentally to touch the next
string<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.040> obstruct<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.819> note<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:56.140> when<00:02:56.290> you

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
string and obstruct the note so when you

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.630 
string and obstruct the note so when you
pluck<00:02:56.620> each<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.099> strings<00:02:57.370> with<00:02:57.549> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
pluck each of the strings with the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.040 
pluck each of the strings with the
plectrum

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.440 

it<00:03:02.680> should<00:03:02.950> say<00:03:03.130> nice<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.730> clear<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.180> that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
it should say nice and clear like that

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.570 
it should say nice and clear like that
so<00:03:05.050> if<00:03:05.140> any<00:03:05.290> of<00:03:05.380> these<00:03:05.530> notes<00:03:05.830> I'll<00:03:06.070> incorrect

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
so if any of these notes I'll incorrect

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.040 
so if any of these notes I'll incorrect
is<00:03:06.760> probably<00:03:07.060> because<00:03:07.210> you're<00:03:07.420> accidentally

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
is probably because you're accidentally

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.560 
is probably because you're accidentally
touching<00:03:08.710> one<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.910> strings<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.540> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
touching one of the strings with the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.930 
touching one of the strings with the
back<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:11.020> your<00:03:11.140> fingers<00:03:11.560> accidentally<00:03:12.400> okay

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
back of your fingers accidentally okay

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.640 
back of your fingers accidentally okay
so<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.510> might<00:03:13.660> take<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:13.960> little<00:03:14.200> bit<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.380> work

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
so it might take a little bit of work

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.200 
so it might take a little bit of work
and<00:03:14.860> you'll<00:03:15.010> need<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.310> shuffle<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:15.850> fingers

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.450 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers
around<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.660> get<00:03:16.810> used<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.290> how<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> hold<00:03:18.250> down

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
around and get used to how to hold down

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.070 
around and get used to how to hold down
the<00:03:18.610> cord<00:03:18.850> but<00:03:19.060> eventually<00:03:19.360> you'll<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.960> it

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
the cord but eventually you'll get it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.880 
the cord but eventually you'll get it
sounding<00:03:20.410> nice<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.740> clear

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
sounding nice and clear

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.280 
sounding nice and clear
so<00:03:23.550> that's<00:03:23.730> something<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.090> work<00:03:24.270> towards<00:03:24.930> so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
so that's something to work towards so

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.750 
so that's something to work towards so
next<00:03:25.590> chord<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.860> want<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.070> show<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> E

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
next chord I want to show you is the a E

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.970 
next chord I want to show you is the a E
chord<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.450> looks<00:03:27.660> like<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.770> what<00:03:28.920> I'm

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
chord and it looks like this so what I'm

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.470 
chord and it looks like this so what I'm
going<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.130> ask<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.520> do<00:03:29.700> is<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.180> put<00:03:30.360> your

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
going to ask you to do is to put your

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.330 
going to ask you to do is to put your
first<00:03:30.690> finger<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.440> fourth<00:03:31.920> string<00:03:32.010> of

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
first finger on the fourth string of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.460 
first finger on the fourth string of
fret<00:03:32.520> 2<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.690> middle<00:03:33.960> finger<00:03:34.290> on<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
fret 2 and the middle finger on the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.520 
fret 2 and the middle finger on the
third<00:03:34.590> string<00:03:34.830> at<00:03:35.490> fret<00:03:35.550> 2<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.330> then<00:03:37.020> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
third string at fret 2 and then the

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.290 
third string at fret 2 and then the
third<00:03:38.010> finger<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.550> second<00:03:38.940> string<00:03:39.000> at

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
third finger on the second string at

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.230 
third finger on the second string at
fret<00:03:39.330> 2<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.500> they're<00:03:40.890> all<00:03:41.100> at<00:03:41.310> fret<00:03:41.550> 2<00:03:41.850> but

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
fret 2 so they're all at fret 2 but

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.820 
fret 2 so they're all at fret 2 but
unfortunately<00:03:42.930> there's<00:03:43.110> not<00:03:43.260> quite<00:03:43.560> enough

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
unfortunately there's not quite enough

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.430 
unfortunately there's not quite enough
room<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.640> fit<00:03:44.910> them<00:03:45.090> all<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.450> ideally

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
room really to fit them all in ideally

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.960 
room really to fit them all in ideally
we'd<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.950> get<00:03:47.130> them<00:03:47.280> right<00:03:47.460> next<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
we'd like to get them right next to the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.390 
we'd like to get them right next to the
fret<00:03:48.240> but<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.840> reality<00:03:49.110> what<00:03:49.620> happens<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> we

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
fret but in reality what happens is we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.070 
fret but in reality what happens is we
end<00:03:50.430> up<00:03:50.700> using<00:03:50.880> them<00:03:51.270> at<00:03:51.360> an<00:03:51.480> angle<00:03:51.600> like<00:03:52.050> this

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
end up using them at an angle like this

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.780 
end up using them at an angle like this
because<00:03:52.620> that's<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.070> only<00:03:53.250> way<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:53.610> to

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
because that's the only way really to

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.970 
because that's the only way really to
squash<00:03:54.540> them<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.920> course

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
squash them in there and of course

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.710 
squash them in there and of course
everyone's<00:03:56.610> hands<00:03:56.850> are<00:03:57.060> different<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.600> know

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
everyone's hands are different you know

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.420 
everyone's hands are different you know
if<00:03:57.900> you've<00:03:58.020> got<00:03:58.200> skinny<00:03:58.530> little<00:03:58.740> fingers<00:03:59.220> then

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
if you've got skinny little fingers then

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.880 
if you've got skinny little fingers then
you'll<00:03:59.700> probably<00:03:59.880> find<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.270> easier<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.350> look

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
you'll probably find it easier so look

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.470 
you'll probably find it easier so look
at<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.100> chord<00:04:02.310> chart<00:04:02.550> next<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.970> me<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.390> to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
at the chord chart next to me just to

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.720 
at the chord chart next to me just to
clarify<00:04:03.690> what<00:04:04.260> notes<00:04:04.530> we're<00:04:05.280> holding<00:04:05.580> them

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
clarify what notes we're holding them

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.910 
clarify what notes we're holding them
now<00:04:06.239> with<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> chord<00:04:07.050> we're<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.739> going<00:04:07.890> to

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
now with the a chord we're just going to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.190 
now with the a chord we're just going to
use<00:04:07.980> five<00:04:08.370> strings<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> mean<00:04:09.959> by<00:04:10.020> that

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
use five strings and what I mean by that

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.870 
use five strings and what I mean by that
is<00:04:10.620> we're<00:04:10.830> not<00:04:10.980> going<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.280> pluck<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.550> sixth

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
is we're not going to pluck the sixth

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.250 
is we're not going to pluck the sixth
string<00:04:12.090> we're<00:04:12.300> just<00:04:12.480> gonna<00:04:12.630> pluck<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> fifth

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
string we're just gonna pluck the fifth

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.849 
string we're just gonna pluck the fifth
string<00:04:13.500> downwards<00:04:13.980> like<00:04:14.190> this

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.119 

okay<00:04:18.729> now<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.509> course<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:20.079> I<00:04:20.229> said<00:04:20.259> before<00:04:20.650> it

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:21.129 
okay now of course like I said before it

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.890 
okay now of course like I said before it
would<00:04:21.250> be<00:04:21.370> unusual<00:04:21.489> if<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.240> got<00:04:22.419> it<00:04:22.539> signing

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
would be unusual if you got it signing

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.040 
would be unusual if you got it signing
perfect<00:04:23.439> straight<00:04:23.740> away<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:25.150> know<00:04:25.300> what

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
usually happens the back of this finger

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.480 
usually happens the back of this finger
on<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.870> cords<00:04:29.409> accidentally<00:04:30.009> touches<00:04:30.370> the

okay good so now let's move on to the

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.030 
okay good so now let's move on to the
third<00:04:46.840> chord<00:04:47.139> I'm<00:04:47.290> going<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.470> show<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.680> which

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
third chord I'm going to show you which

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.969 
third chord I'm going to show you which
is<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.430> D<00:04:48.639> chord<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.690> if<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.259> put<00:04:50.650> your<00:04:50.770> first

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
is the D chord so if you put your first

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.999 
is the D chord so if you put your first
finger<00:04:51.130> on<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.150> third<00:04:52.419> string<00:04:52.449> at<00:04:53.169> fret<00:04:53.410> two

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
finger on the third string at fret two

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.950 
finger on the third string at fret two
now<00:04:54.639> listen<00:04:54.940> carefully<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:55.690> because

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
now listen carefully to this because

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.600 
now listen carefully to this because
some<00:04:56.169> people<00:04:56.470> get<00:04:56.560> muddled<00:04:56.949> up<00:04:57.039> with<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.340> one

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
some people get muddled up with this one

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.760 
some people get muddled up with this one
the<00:04:58.060> middle<00:04:58.300> finger<00:04:58.780> goes<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.169> to<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.440> first

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the middle finger goes on to the first

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.550 
the middle finger goes on to the first
string<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.340> fret<00:05:00.729> two<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.270> then<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.229> third

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
string of fret two and then this third

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.650 
string of fret two and then this third
finger<00:05:02.979> goes<00:05:03.160> on<00:05:03.190> to<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.669> second<00:05:04.090> string<00:05:04.360> at

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
finger goes on to the second string at

at them next to you so you don't have to
keep<00:05:46.389> rewinding<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:47.020> video<00:05:47.289> and<00:05:47.620> practice

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
keep rewinding the video and practice

them and practice them and get them
sounding<00:05:49.810> nice<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.199> clear<00:05:53.099> now<00:05:54.099> there's

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
sounding nice and clear now there's

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.770 
sounding nice and clear now there's
something<00:05:54.520> else<00:05:54.699> I<00:05:54.910> want<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.180> tell<00:05:55.360> you<00:05:55.570> you

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
something else I want to tell you you

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.350 
something else I want to tell you you
may<00:05:55.960> have<00:05:55.990> noticed<00:05:56.680> my<00:05:56.740> thumb<00:05:57.280> sort<00:05:58.000> of<00:05:58.120> kind

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
may have noticed my thumb sort of kind

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.790 
may have noticed my thumb sort of kind
of<00:05:58.449> hanging<00:05:58.750> around<00:05:58.810> here<00:05:59.289> over<00:05:59.500> the<00:05:59.590> top<00:05:59.620> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
of hanging around here over the top of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.230 
of hanging around here over the top of
the<00:05:59.979> guitar<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.340> there<00:06:00.610> is<00:06:00.729> a<00:06:00.760> reason<00:06:01.210> for

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
the guitar and there is a reason for

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480 
the guitar and there is a reason for
this<00:06:01.539> when<00:06:02.380> we're<00:06:02.530> strumming<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:02.889> a<00:06:03.039> chord

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
this when we're strumming the a chord

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.089 
this when we're strumming the a chord
for<00:06:04.389> example<00:06:04.419> we<00:06:05.050> don't<00:06:05.260> want<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.770> sixth

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
for example we don't want the sixth

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.399 
for example we don't want the sixth
string<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:06.610> accidentally<00:06:07.300> make<00:06:07.449> a<00:06:07.479> noise<00:06:07.720> so

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
string to accidentally make a noise so

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.320 
string to accidentally make a noise so
what<00:06:08.560> I'm<00:06:08.650> doing<00:06:08.710> is<00:06:09.099> gently<00:06:09.729> touching<00:06:10.180> it

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
what I'm doing is gently touching it

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.870 
what I'm doing is gently touching it
just<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.690> little<00:06:10.990> bit<00:06:11.199> with<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:12.039> thumb<00:06:12.280> and

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
just a little bit with the thumb and

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.089 
just a little bit with the thumb and
that's<00:06:13.090> enough<00:06:13.720> just<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.139> mute<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.560> note<00:06:14.770> so

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
that's enough just to mute the note so

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.490 
that's enough just to mute the note so
it<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:16.330> stops<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.930> sixth<00:06:17.199> string<00:06:17.320> from

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
it it stops the sixth string from

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.409 
it it stops the sixth string from
accidentally<00:06:18.070> making<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.460> noise<00:06:18.639> and<00:06:19.000> then

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
accidentally making the noise and then

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.450 
accidentally making the noise and then
when<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.750> strum<00:06:20.050> all<00:06:20.199> the<00:06:20.260> five<00:06:20.590> strings

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
when you strum all the five strings

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.189 
when you strum all the five strings
and<00:06:23.030> you<00:06:23.180> know<00:06:23.360> you're<00:06:23.539> only<00:06:23.840> just<00:06:24.050> getting

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
and you know you're only just getting

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.020 
and you know you're only just getting
the<00:06:24.380> correct<00:06:24.650> notes<00:06:24.949> that<00:06:25.190> you<00:06:25.280> want<00:06:25.490> so

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
the correct notes that you want so

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.999 
the correct notes that you want so
that's<00:06:26.150> the<00:06:26.330> reason<00:06:26.690> for<00:06:26.840> that<00:06:26.900> so<00:06:27.319> what<00:06:27.860> you

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:28.009 
that's the reason for that so what you

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.830 
that's the reason for that so what you
can<00:06:28.190> do<00:06:28.430> once<00:06:28.759> you've<00:06:28.940> learned<00:06:29.150> these<00:06:29.360> chords

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
can do once you've learned these chords

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.200 
can do once you've learned these chords
is<00:06:30.139> put<00:06:30.919> them<00:06:31.039> into<00:06:31.160> a<00:06:31.280> bit<00:06:31.430> of<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.610> sequence<00:06:32.030> for

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.300 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for
example<00:06:32.750> you<00:06:32.870> could<00:06:33.080> play<00:06:33.319> the<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.650> chord

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.710 

four<00:06:37.310> times<00:06:37.669> and<00:06:37.970> then<00:06:38.060> you<00:06:38.150> could<00:06:38.300> play<00:06:38.389> the<00:06:38.569> D

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
four times and then you could play the D

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.320 
four times and then you could play the D
chord

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.490 

back<00:06:41.870> to<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.169> a

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.800 

and<00:06:45.070> then<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.370> eCourse

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:59.090 

then<00:06:48.290> you<00:06:48.380> can<00:06:48.500> do<00:06:48.620> that<00:06:48.770> again

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.670 

so<00:06:59.940> you<00:07:00.000> can<00:07:00.180> begin<00:07:00.330> practicing<00:07:01.110> changing

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
so you can begin practicing changing

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.050
