00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
I will show you the technique which I use to carry out my cuttings

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.400
then it is a technique which will enable you to multiply very quickly

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.549
your seedlings

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.199
and thus to be able to have trees

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.999
very easily.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.029
You can make some all the year!

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.659
simply I chose the period of May which is that more

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.560
effective.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
With this intention you will need a pair of scissors

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.149
all that is simpler!

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
Of a knife or a blade or a trencher,

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
cells with a compact substrate

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.490
I use a substrate containing sand here,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.940
and of compost

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.400
that will enable me to have a compact substrate which will be able

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.040
to facilitate the development of the roots

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.930
very fine.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.400
On the other hand it will be necessary to sprinkle enormously, i.e. there,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.590
they will be two waterings perhaps three per day!

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.980
One will take a branch of a Palmatum maple,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.420
then one will pay attention to have a branch Ripened,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.900
who is lignified,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.530
because the cuttings are done on

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.350
the lignified part of the branch.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.010
For example here, we have a branch which is rather long,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.750
I will cross here,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.680
and we will take all this part of the branch, and will leave

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.700
green part

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.840
on side!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660
I think that with this one will have to make all our cuttings enough!

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.340
See, there is nevertheless…

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.520
not bad!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
and the cells which are ready, filled with substrate

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.400
There are a little stones also…

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.500
however,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.950
fill of sand and compost.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.230
You will take

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.790
your first branch,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.280
me I always cross to the intersection of a small growth.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.500
You remove

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.940
all sheets, except two!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.350
You leave only two sheets.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.110
and then

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.250
you come at the base from the cutting and you remove one centimetre of bark.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.829
You go until Cambium.

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.109
Your cutting is ready, see, I left a small centimetre

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.799
sectional view,

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.219
two small sheets,

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:23.609
and it cut is slightly above

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.719
small branch.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.049
Then you come to plant

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.469
in your cell.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.489
Always similar, you leave two sheets,

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.279
you skin,

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.279
on approximately one centimetre,

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.429
then there it is the stage where you could possibly soak it in hormone of cutting,

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.199
so that you still go from better results.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.519
Then you come to plant it,

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.239
in the compact substrate envisaged for this purpose.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.209
Why is this technique used?

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.469
The cutting with trend with

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.469
to evaporate, there are too many sheets above…

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.809
and it does not have a root. Thus water will evaporate

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.789
completely from the cutting and it will be desiccated.

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.789
If you remove all the sheets, and that you leave two of them,

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.900
it will have a slightly stationary state,

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.459
if you give him what it is necessary like light,

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:27.389
like heat and water, it will start to create root with its

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.029
base to be able to take again forces, to be able

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.049
again to root

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.869
and rather quickly to make propagate the maple palmatum.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.089
Here, it is the simple maple palmatum, and not the hybrids,

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.249
because the hybrids are more fragile and more complicated to propagate.

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:48.629
You will thus spend more time to do it, but I did not say that you will not arrive there!

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.149
Simply you will spend more time and you will have less success!

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.939
With a maple palmatum (simple) you will have 80 to 90% of success if you take

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.629
correctly.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.159
The advantage of knowing to propagate, it is qu you will learn

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.859
also to cultivate,

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.589
and to make a bonsai,

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:10.589
it is necessary to know to cultivate perfectly!

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.139
Here, I will continue to fill the unit of my cells,

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.539
once it will be done, I will put them in culture at the shade,

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.989
and I will sprinkle two to three times per days, minimum!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.080
You can also put them in greenhouse,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.759
that will boost the effect of the light and heat,

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.879
il faudra toujours arroser énormément, deux trois quatre fois par jours

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.100
if you can it!

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100
bye!
