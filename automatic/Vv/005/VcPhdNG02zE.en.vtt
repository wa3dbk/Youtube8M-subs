00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
and the idea is you don't put it in the

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.240 
and the idea is you don't put it in the
warm<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:30.449> will<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.810> melt<00:00:31.109> into<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.040> and

warm and it will just melt into it and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.340 
warm and it will just melt into it and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
then after its melter that's going to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.140 
then after its melter that's going to
leave<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.650> there<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.190> cool<00:00:35.460> slightly<00:00:35.940> before

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
leave it there to cool slightly before

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.050

always<00:02:02.970> have<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.270> stash<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:03.840> lets<00:02:04.260> us<00:02:04.410> pour

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
always have a stash of this lets us pour

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:13.360 
always have a stash of this lets us pour
in<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.630> mixture<00:02:09.619> mix<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:13.080> then

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
in the mixture mix that in and then

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
in the mixture mix that in and then
whites<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.720> fold<00:02:15.930> them<00:02:16.110> white<00:02:16.290> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
whites now when you fold them white it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.350 
whites now when you fold them white it's
easiest<00:02:17.190> always<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.760> start<00:02:18.030> off<00:02:18.150> by

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
easiest always if you start off by

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.229 
easiest always if you start off by
giving<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.110> dollops<00:02:19.500> spoonful<00:02:20.430> into<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.880> basic

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
giving a dollops spoonful into the basic

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.300 
giving a dollops spoonful into the basic
mixture<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.110> whisking<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.709> vigorously

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
mixture and whisking really vigorously

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.850 
mixture and whisking really vigorously
scared<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.390> completely<00:02:25.290> beat<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> in

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
scared just completely beat it in

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.770 
scared just completely beat it in
because<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.550> will<00:02:26.670> make<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.330> kind<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.570> base

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
because this will make the kind of base

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.050 
because this will make the kind of base
mixture<00:02:28.410> much<00:02:28.980> lighter<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.880> make<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
mixture much lighter and if you make it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.580 
mixture much lighter and if you make it
much<00:02:30.239> easier<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.690> fold<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.140> egg<00:02:31.320> whites

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
much easier to fold in the egg whites

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.120 
much easier to fold in the egg whites
now<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.100> don't<00:02:32.310> know<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.520> risk<00:02:33.050> okay<00:02:34.050> no<00:02:34.680> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
now we don't know the risk okay no you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.320 
now we don't know the risk okay no you
need<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.489> patient's<00:02:35.880> person<00:02:36.209> for

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
need to be a patient's person for

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.710 
need to be a patient's person for
folding<00:02:36.660> I'm<00:02:36.840> not<00:02:37.080> particularly<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.720> I

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
folding I'm not particularly but I I

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.949 
folding I'm not particularly but I I
think<00:02:40.230> somehow<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.340> always<00:02:41.820> better<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
think somehow it's always better not to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.070 
think somehow it's always better not to
be<00:02:43.049> scared<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.620> egg<00:02:43.769> whites<00:02:44.040> ah<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:45.120> know<00:02:45.660> that

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
be scared of egg whites ah I know that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.690 
be scared of egg whites ah I know that
the<00:02:46.170> idea<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.500> you've<00:02:46.680> got<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.799> be<00:02:46.950> gentle<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
the idea is you've got to be gentle and

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.610 
the idea is you've got to be gentle and
not<00:02:47.880> get<00:02:48.000> any<00:02:48.180> air<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.630> but<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:49.320> you're<00:02:49.410> too

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
not get any air out but if you're too

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.470 
not get any air out but if you're too
scared<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.100> think<00:02:50.130> somehow<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.970> does<00:02:51.239> sometimes

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
scared I think somehow it does sometimes

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.210 
scared I think somehow it does sometimes
permeate<00:02:52.140> its<00:02:52.320> way<00:02:52.440> into<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.769> cooking<00:02:53.100> I

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
permeate its way into the cooking I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.270 
permeate its way into the cooking I
think<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:53.790> have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.630> relax<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:56.160> will

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
think you just have to relax and it will

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.550 
think you just have to relax and it will
go<00:02:56.400> better<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.970> look<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:57.630> folding<00:02:58.440> in
