when<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.199> grow<00:00:01.589> up<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:02.129> want<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.760> first

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
when I grow up I want to be the first

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.090 
when I grow up I want to be the first
person<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.600> human<00:00:03.899> history<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.529> teleport

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
person in human history to teleport

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.340 
person in human history to teleport
himself<00:00:05.810> you<00:00:06.810> know<00:00:06.839> when<00:00:07.109> you're<00:00:07.230> that

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
himself you know when you're that

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.629 
himself you know when you're that
intelligent<00:00:07.919> there's<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> few<00:00:08.250> people<00:00:08.400> that

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
intelligent there's a few people that

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.990 
intelligent there's a few people that
can<00:00:09.120> understand<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.309> get<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.460> take<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
can understand you I get to take a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
can understand you I get to take a
character<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.480> everybody<00:00:12.719> knows<00:00:13.080> Reed

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
character that everybody knows Reed

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
character that everybody knows Reed
Richards<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.880> get<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.120> take<00:00:15.269> him<00:00:15.420> 20<00:00:15.750> years

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
Richards and we get to take him 20 years

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.800 
Richards and we get to take him 20 years
before<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:17.000> think<00:00:18.000> he<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.270> wants<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
before I think he just wants to do the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
before I think he just wants to do the
first<00:00:19.140> she'd<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.710> able<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.039> something<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
first she'd be able to do something that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.679 
first she'd be able to do something that
nobody<00:00:20.699> has<00:00:20.939> done<00:00:21.090> before

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
nobody has done before

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
nobody has done before
don't<00:00:21.960> go<00:00:22.140> whenever<00:00:22.830> you're<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> smartest

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
don't go whenever you're the smartest

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.330 
don't go whenever you're the smartest
person<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> room<00:00:24.029> that's<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> lot<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> power

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.970 

where'd<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> car<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.060> don't<00:00:30.660> know<00:00:30.779> yet

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
where'd the car go I don't know yet

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.160 
where'd the car go I don't know yet
you're<00:00:31.980> insane

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
you're insane

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.889 
you're insane
Thanks<00:00:34.370> in<00:00:35.370> high<00:00:35.640> school<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.540> wants<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.750> do

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
Thanks in high school all he wants to do

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.450 
Thanks in high school all he wants to do
is<00:00:37.020> build<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.350> quantum<00:00:37.710> gate<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.190> may<00:00:38.309> want

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
is build this quantum gate you may want

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
is build this quantum gate you may want
to<00:00:38.489> cover<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:38.760> ears<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.320> works<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to cover your ears it kind of works but

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.139 
to cover your ears it kind of works but
not<00:00:40.860> really

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
not really

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
not really
I<00:00:42.379> think<00:00:43.379> you've<00:00:43.559> cracked<00:00:43.860> interdimensional

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
I think you've cracked interdimensional

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.940 
I think you've cracked interdimensional
truck<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> get<00:00:45.809> recruited<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.739> go<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
truck and then I get recruited to go to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.360 
truck and then I get recruited to go to
Baxter<00:00:47.930> which<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> magnet<00:00:49.829> school<00:00:49.980> for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
Baxter which is like a magnet school for

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
Baxter which is like a magnet school for
child<00:00:51.090> prodigies<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.170> wouldn't<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.469> famous

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
child prodigies you wouldn't be famous

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.380 
child prodigies you wouldn't be famous
I<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.610> work<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> difference

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
I just want my work to make a difference

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.650 
I just want my work to make a difference
you<00:00:56.000> basically<00:00:57.000> ripped<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.270> hole<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you basically ripped a hole in the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
you basically ripped a hole in the
fabric<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> space-time<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.829> no<00:00:59.010> supervision

fabric of space-time with no supervision

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
fabric of space-time with no supervision
that<00:00:59.789> was<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.120> accident<00:01:00.539> once<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> quantum

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that was an accident once the quantum

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
that was an accident once the quantum
gate<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> project<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.969> finished<00:01:03.229> we'll<00:01:04.229> have

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
gate to project is finished we'll have

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.510 
gate to project is finished we'll have
control<00:01:05.150> but<00:01:06.150> things<00:01:06.420> didn't<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.810> planned

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
control but things didn't go as planned

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.850 
control but things didn't go as planned
don't<00:01:09.000> blow<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.330> please<00:01:10.020> don't<00:01:10.590> blow<00:01:10.920> up

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.789 

these<00:01:15.860> survivors<00:01:16.369> I'll<00:01:17.030> be<00:01:17.390> all<00:01:18.049> exhibited

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
these survivors I'll be all exhibited

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.130 
these survivors I'll be all exhibited

four of us and not one single person can
do<00:01:31.550> everything<00:01:32.060> by<00:01:32.330> themselves<00:01:32.450> if<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.320> can

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
do everything by themselves if you can

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.430 
do everything by themselves if you can
work<00:01:33.680> together<00:01:34.690> then<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:35.960> change<00:01:36.260> the
