00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
and you'll also need two jump rings so
just<00:00:19.920> start<00:00:20.250> by<00:00:20.490> wrapping<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.330> wire<00:00:21.359> around

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
interest though and then curve the wire

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.349 
interest though and then curve the wire
down<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.219> future

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
down the future

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.759

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
oh say can you see the future is it bad

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.899 
oh say can you see the future is it bad
then<00:00:52.769> you're<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> come<00:00:53.339> down<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> little

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
bit and make a curve in the opposite

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.590 
bit and make a curve in the opposite
direction<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.659> can<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:59.549> turn

going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> continue<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.129> curve<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
going to continue the curve and so you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.450 
going to continue the curve and so you
have<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> loop<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.009> what<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.280> should
