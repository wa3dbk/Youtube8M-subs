00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
I'm doing real quick first I'm doing

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.169 
I'm doing real quick first I'm doing
this<00:00:13.230> mainly<00:00:13.469> because<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.610> xsplit

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this mainly because I just got xsplit

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.730 
this mainly because I just got xsplit
and<00:00:15.420> that's<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.960> device<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.470> using<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and that's the device that I'm using to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.349 
and that's the device that I'm using to
record<00:00:16.830> kind<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.550> comparing<00:00:17.910> fraps

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
record kind of just comparing fraps

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.900 
record kind of just comparing fraps
versus<00:00:18.869> xsplit<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.890> worth<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.760> because

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
versus xsplit if it's worth it because

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.800 
versus xsplit if it's worth it because
right<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:21.660> expose<00:00:22.170> free<00:00:23.900> vs<00:00:24.900> fraps<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.630> can

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
right now expose free vs fraps and I can

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
right now expose free vs fraps and I can

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
you can't do that with fraps so that's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.310 
you can't do that with fraps so that's
where<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.700> why<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:32.969> doing<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.020> anyways

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
figured you know that was the way to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.479 
figured you know that was the way to
test<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:39.530> I'm<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.010> affliction

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
test it I'm gonna do it as affliction

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.619 
test it I'm gonna do it as affliction
because<00:00:41.640> affliction<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.300> has<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.570> more

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
because affliction just has a lot more

typically<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:47.899> kind<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> sucks<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> don't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
typically can kind of sucks that I don't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
typically can kind of sucks that I don't
have<00:00:49.649> spell<00:00:49.950> haste<00:00:50.420> but<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.840> still<00:00:52.410> goes

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
have spell haste but it still goes

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.069 
have spell haste but it still goes
pretty<00:00:52.890> quick<00:00:53.300> I'm<00:00:54.300> using<00:00:54.690> grimoire

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
pretty quick I'm using grimoire

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
pretty quick I'm using grimoire
sacrifice<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> wanted<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> point<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> out

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
sacrifice just wanted to point this out

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.849 
sacrifice just wanted to point this out
the<00:00:57.210> reason<00:00:57.420> I'm<00:00:57.510> doing<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the reason I'm doing it is because you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.580 
the reason I'm doing it is because you
know<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> enslaved<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> pit<00:00:59.789> Lord<00:01:00.469> with<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
know you enslaved the pit Lord with the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
know you enslaved the pit Lord with the
pit<00:01:01.739> Lord<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> enslaved<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.879> can't<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
pit Lord and enslaved you can't use a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.939 
pit Lord and enslaved you can't use a
pet<00:01:03.629> therefore<00:01:04.229> there's<00:01:04.409> no<00:01:04.530> reason<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
pet therefore there's no reason to be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.200 
pet therefore there's no reason to be
supremacy<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.549> service<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.610> good<00:01:09.090> more

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
supremacy or service so it's good more

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
supremacy or service so it's good more
sacrifices<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> talent<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> use<00:01:11.280> as

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
sacrifices not the talent to use as

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
sacrifices not the talent to use as
affliction<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.150> any<00:01:12.390> newbies<00:01:13.020> watching<00:01:13.530> this

I'm<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.159> doing<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:14.970> there's<00:01:15.780> no

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I'm just doing it because there's no

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.539 
I'm just doing it because there's no
reason<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> other<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:16.979> talents<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
all she wrote folks trying to think how

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.800 
all she wrote folks trying to think how
fast<00:03:09.879> that<00:03:10.060> would<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.299> been<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.690> would

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
fast that would have been that would

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.839 
fast that would have been that would
have<00:03:10.870> been<00:03:11.049> under<00:03:11.650> 40<00:03:11.920> seconds<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.340> think<00:03:12.579> just

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
have been under 40 seconds I think just

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.470 
have been under 40 seconds I think just
based<00:03:13.030> off<00:03:13.180> Dark<00:03:13.480> Soul<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:14.709> too<00:03:14.890> bad

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
based off Dark Soul not too bad

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.750 
based off Dark Soul not too bad
yeah<00:03:17.470> first<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.919> was<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:18.190> for<00:03:18.370> under<00:03:18.579> 30

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
yeah first I was going for under 30

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.780 
yeah first I was going for under 30
seconds<00:03:19.180> but<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> did<00:03:20.019> not<00:03:20.280> happen<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.549> guess

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
seconds but that did not happen I guess

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.370 
seconds but that did not happen I guess
I<00:03:22.180> think<00:03:22.569> that's<00:03:22.720> about<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:22.989> best<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.319> I'm

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
I think that's about as best as I'm

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.360 
I think that's about as best as I'm
going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.620> able<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.769> do<00:03:23.889> I've<00:03:24.010> tried<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.310> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
going to be able to do I've tried it a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.440 
going to be able to do I've tried it a
few<00:03:24.549> times<00:03:26.549> might<00:03:27.549> try<00:03:27.760> one<00:03:27.940> more<00:03:28.030> time<00:03:28.209> just

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
few times might try one more time just

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.229 
few times might try one more time just
for<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.660> fun<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.049> but<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.940> will<00:03:31.090> be
