five times and it increases the damage a
heroic<00:04:28.720> strike<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:30.750> each<00:04:31.750> time<00:04:32.080> its<00:04:32.290> tax<00:04:32.500> one

heroic strike so each time its tax one

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.260 
heroic strike so each time its tax one
hundred<00:04:32.860> percent<00:04:32.890> so<00:04:33.700> you<00:04:33.760> do<00:04:33.940> one<00:04:34.060> hundred

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
hundred percent so you do one hundred
