00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.359
 May so next week Tuesday was also 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.219
 Somehow it's clear that rockstar this 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.870

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.489

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.019
 nice money and rp I was able to boost 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.059
 by the way, that weekend too 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.129
 used to my account balance on nice 5 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.620
 To bring millions of dollars everything legally 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.649
 he plays with desires of stress on the road 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.960
 roof there is always so on the edge but now 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.670
 back to the glamor update like he already did 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.769
 through my video brand new spring 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.510
 updates can you know now a 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.089
 So you own the second apartment 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.680
 space for ten more cars yes 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.630
 altogether should be between 59 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.000
 Apartments with completely new 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.799
 Interior design can choose something 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 negative I think that the locations as 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.549
 for example, eclipse stars richard with 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.320
 joysticks and so on the same 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.020
 Spokespersons have remained practical 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.149
 new apartments in the old locations but 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 hey important are just just the 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.240
 ten new garages or not 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.649
 the news is still new are the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.750
 screenshots example you can see now 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.640
 For the first time the three new cars from 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 left to right the car centro the the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.320
 machine sacrow among them hans ley in 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.880
 their tuned shapes and now 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.950
 absolutely sure that it is 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.810
 sports car over China's agro by one 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.999
 allusion to the aston martin vanquish 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.469
 is brand new spring in the video 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.179
 Updates I was still in the opinion that 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.450
 it is the first marks the 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.880
 Bonds is the luxury suvs huntley 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.320
 based on the bentley falcon before 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.950
 I had just said that it was the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.749
 Bentley concept suvs you know it 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.030
 surely you are also a new one 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.009
 can buy motorcycle namely the dinka 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.960
 There is frost from the machine now 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.940
 also a first screenshot and that 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.540
 Part looks suspiciously after the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.000
 the eba series from the last 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.830
 news is still the 15 new jobs 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.060
 join in 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.040
 actually already standard for a genius 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.710
 online update but what really made me 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.680
 has tuned surprise is the five of them 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.850
 five of the new completely new 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.800
 are missions 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.990
 I hope very time that they slightly 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.270
 more demanding than the standard 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.550
 mission and throw off a lot of coal 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.350
 So practically something like a mixture 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.230
 from the law centers connection and 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.970
 Stress on the roof the rest of the news 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.200
 article has been known for some time so 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.850
 for example, that you have the new ball 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.990
 You can buy the contactless ones repulsed 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.490
 race where the other driver 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.800
 are semi-transparent and no room 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.180
 possible is the mental state statistics 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.370
 as the behavior of the other players at 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.770
 shows new clothes autohupen and 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.690
 Winning offers if you have more 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.190
 details about glamor update know 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.260
 for example, wanted the tuning parts 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.360
 looking at the new cars and so on 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.660
 Just in my video brand new 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 spring updates to the bank robs 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.500
 rockstar did not mention anything we should then 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.210
 probably appear on the twentieth fifth 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 that would be a tuesday again and 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.480
 exactly a week before the release of hot 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.300

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.400
