agree<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> i<00:00:41.670> thought<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.450> land<00:00:42.719> has

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809

agree with you i thought that land has
been<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.170> undervalued<00:00:43.760> commodity<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
been an undervalued commodity in the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
been an undervalued commodity in the
marketplace<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.500> talked<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> most

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
marketplace because you talked the most

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.619 
marketplace because you talked the most
oddsmakers<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.910> don't<00:00:48.090> even<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:48.510> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
oddsmakers they don't even have them in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.010 
oddsmakers they don't even have them in
their<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.960> five<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.680> disagreed<00:00:50.550> until<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:51.719> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
their top five I disagreed until now I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
their top five I disagreed until now I
think<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> betting<00:00:53.370> markets<00:00:53.730> caught<00:00:54.000> up

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
think now the betting markets caught up

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
think now the betting markets caught up
because<00:00:54.449> they've<00:00:54.960> won<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:55.440> prime<00:00:55.739> time

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
because they've won some prime time

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.590 
because they've won some prime time
games<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:56.969> importantly<00:00:57.390> they've

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
games and more importantly they've

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.310 
games and more importantly they've
covered<00:00:57.899> whenever<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.739> team's<00:00:59.309> 8<00:00:59.609> no<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.329> six

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
covered whenever a team's 8 no and six

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
covered whenever a team's 8 no and six
and<00:01:01.500> two<00:01:01.620> against<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.039> spread<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.670> think

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and two against the spread I think

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.660 
and two against the spread I think
that's<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> classic<00:01:04.080> reflection<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.369> team

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that's a classic reflection of a team

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
that's a classic reflection of a team
being<00:01:05.850> undervalued<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> betting<00:01:06.960> market

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
being undervalued in the betting market

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.649 
being undervalued in the betting market
because<00:01:08.010> usually<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.580> ain't<00:01:08.729> no<00:01:08.880> team<00:01:09.210> you'll

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
because usually an ain't no team you'll

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
because usually an ain't no team you'll
be<00:01:09.780> lucky<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.229> four<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.500> four<00:01:10.799> 80s<00:01:11.280> because

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
be lucky to be four and four 80s because

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
be lucky to be four and four 80s because
everyone's<00:01:12.000> betting<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.260> oddsmakers

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
everyone's betting it and the oddsmakers

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.170 
everyone's betting it and the oddsmakers
are<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> protect<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> bookmakers<00:01:15.000> by

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
are going to protect the bookmakers by

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.060 
are going to protect the bookmakers by
inflating<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.780> price<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.650> packers<00:01:17.040> are

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
inflating the price if the packers are

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.740 
inflating the price if the packers are
ain't<00:01:17.280> no<00:01:17.460> they're<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.240> 6<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> 2

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
ain't no they're not going to be 6 and 2

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.109 
ain't no they're not going to be 6 and 2
80's<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.590> times<00:01:19.890> than<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.159> unless<00:01:20.880> they're

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
80's more times than not unless they're

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.719 
80's more times than not unless they're
scoring<00:01:21.390> 55<00:01:21.810> points<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.259> game<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.549> think

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
scoring 55 points a game now I think

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
scoring 55 points a game now I think
it's<00:01:24.030> caught<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.080> more

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it's caught up with them but more

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
it's caught up with them but more
importantly<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> saints<00:01:27.360> coming

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
importantly I think the saints coming

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
importantly I think the saints coming
off<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> big<00:01:28.229> win<00:01:28.470> Monday<00:01:28.799> night<00:01:28.979> here's<00:01:29.700> a

off that big win Monday night here's a

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
team that's not only dangerous but now

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
team that's not only dangerous but now
the<00:01:32.729> sudden<00:01:33.210> believes<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.810> could<00:01:33.990> win<00:01:34.200> some

the sudden believes they could win some

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
room as far as the mentality in the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
room as far as the mentality in the
locker<00:01:43.409> room<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.909> there

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
locker room they want to go out there

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
locker room they want to go out there
and<00:01:45.149> beat<00:01:45.420> some<00:01:45.659> teams<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.170> they<00:01:46.649> could<00:01:46.829> beat

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
and beat some teams and they could beat

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
and beat some teams and they could beat
a<00:01:47.220> division<00:01:47.939> team<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.810> ahead<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.140> them

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
a division team that's way ahead of them

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.280 
a division team that's way ahead of them
I<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.430> bad<00:01:50.670> spot<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.420> Atlanta<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
I think it's a bad spot for Atlanta and

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.929 
I think it's a bad spot for Atlanta and
New<00:01:52.799> Orleans<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.670> team

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
Falcons I think this is a team that's

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.790 
Falcons I think this is a team that's
coming<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:04.300> if<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.990> look<00:04:05.230> back<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.590> last

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
coming on if you look back to last

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.500 
coming on if you look back to last
season<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.400> by<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.670> end<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.060> last<00:04:07.240> season

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
season and by the end of last season

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.750 
season and by the end of last season
they<00:04:08.140> were<00:04:08.200> arguably<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:09.040> best<00:04:09.220> team<00:04:09.520> in<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
they were arguably the best team in the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.400 
they were arguably the best team in the
NFL<00:04:10.120> even<00:04:10.480> though<00:04:10.600> they<00:04:10.750> did<00:04:10.930> lose<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.320> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
NFL even though they did lose in the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.830 
NFL even though they did lose in the
playoffs<00:04:11.440> there's<00:04:12.430> they<00:04:12.790> certainly<00:04:13.510> have

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
playoffs there's they certainly have

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.420 
playoffs there's they certainly have
their<00:04:14.080> problems<00:04:14.320> this<00:04:14.620> year<00:04:14.680> but<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.280> think

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
their problems this year but I think

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.979 
their problems this year but I think
they're<00:04:15.550> rounding<00:04:16.090> backing<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.630> form<00:04:16.900> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
they're rounding backing the form a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.320 
they're rounding backing the form a
little<00:04:17.200> bit<00:04:17.350> i'm<00:04:17.620> getting<00:04:18.040> them<00:04:18.190> as<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.430> dog<00:04:18.970> at
