00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 You will not know I'm in Mexico City 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.920
 what is santafe mall and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.870
 I just found a robot that 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.639
 clean the house as well as hear a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 robot of a very small size that what 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210
 we can see here behind my back is a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.650
 robot that can clean the house and I 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
 I meet with Eduardo and he's going to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
 talk a little about what it is that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.930
 is linked as you are in youtube very 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 well we already have a little bit of what is this 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.619
 robot and how the robot works its 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.439
 main function what you are going to do is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.269
 sweep and vacuum all your floor in this 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 container that is very practical goes to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.019
 deposit all the trash fits a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 little bit more than a pound of garbage are 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.000
 very small things 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.340
 things so they can go under 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.560
 come this is coming 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.520
 being pet hair remains of food 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.050
 videos even even legos 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.210
 all you have to do is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 press the click button so that it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.039
 put this to work 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's have account with sensors that 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.980
 they detect garbage 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.980
 from the largest amount 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.500
 so 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.280
 you do not necessarily have to have stress 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.770
 in anyone who fired us in the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.080
 side part that will help the robot 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.530
 to pull the garbage from the edges of the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 corners 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.630
 with tires 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.340
 that can go over partners and 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.340
 a carpet in shadow 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 and so that he does not run out of material 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.010
 some cable for yes and good our 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.200
 robots come with a base like this 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.570
 this base must be connected to the light and 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.400
 recharge a put an end to once the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.890
 robot finished working or when it is 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.150
 about to stay in charge what it does 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.570

 two hours it was to cover up to 200 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.830
