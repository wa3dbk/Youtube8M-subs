00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.580
 it's going to touch wade before 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.230
 today I propose a small 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.199
 video dos us does not present 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.670
 minecraft of my crater level 105 so 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.020
 a little fear that just for 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.449
 raving that it was missing us and 405 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.379
 earth so I went up recently 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.620
 quickly so the stats a panoplie 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.960
 of 60 in strength a little obvious has not 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.519
 a lot of vita little wisdom not bad 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.500
 agility so that's what allows me 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:47.949
 not like that it's not bad and then to 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.770
 how lucky are the features 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:56.449
 so put p15 pm so it pays it's a 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.750
 small advantage and 28 so that's great 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.309
 cool 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.649
 and then at the level of resistances and 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.269
 it's really not bad 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.330
 so here we are going to be very small 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.720
 little steph very basic symptoms and I 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:12.320
 no longer have a dream helmet see that one out 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.119
 normal game one that so darkens the graft 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.060
 the pink used for satellite 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.399
 for the features she gives me 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 so there the force the society there and the 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.060
 vitality 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.110
 so it's not bad so at brassens is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.619
 not so in fact it's a breakdown at work 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.360
 not our basics 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.000
 so in fact I have full wood panels 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.979
 that actually because it does not hurt 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.770
 of force and looted from agility so for 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.140
 tease a little wisdom and especially the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.780
 resistances to the fact it's really a 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.160
 collision advantage what I do 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.649
 a lot of president at collage and 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.459
 alcatel in packages is really 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.849
 really the advantage renovate kawa a 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.959
 initiator furious the coc level of 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:57.110
 trophies of the trophies that I have kraft 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:02.050
 like that for the sun so are not 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.970
 adapted really great but good 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:11.080
 So here we go directly 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.800
 pocket to be able to call it light 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.860
 so go through it anyway 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.860
 style to support tease so the first 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:27.640
 cultivate I type your trip and 260 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.750
 between 260 and 280 we hide booster 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.560
 like that the destructive 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.740
 I type about 220 yeah that's 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 simple but against the second penis 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.550
 and that's with a little more his 107 a shot 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.620
 critical 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.590
 finally in general except between 480 and 500 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:51.340
 so that's not bad after a few 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.790
 once from camp a coliseum I'm typing 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.070
 popular in itself nor our booster helmets 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.060
 my loved ones a popular at the level of 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.060
 France 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.900
 too bad so if you do not like 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.150
 the monstrous damage so g7 for 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.930
 in fact it was to relax 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.239
 because here I have a cycle that 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.849
 which is 100 110 his tracks for me 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.370
 relax for that important way that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.849
 I was a little fed up here booster l 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.370
 absorbent 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.209
 still more in fact there is the absolute 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:38.110
 it's mostly for the sound that gives me 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:40.319
 so the pleasure between 480 and 500 and 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.810
 some chomsky 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.810
 So here we finish the putsch does not cost 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.489
 it's a little trap like that for 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.230
 one so it's on my chair I think 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.910
 I introduce you Badive mons 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.079
 and case of batons 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.200
 colizen not what I really do 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:06.970
 a lot of kolizéum not too much of which jos 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.959
 is mostly due to that xp to the candidates 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.340
 in the game I think it's not bad but 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:17.229
 nevertheless this is what is the future cap 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.570
 So the wild and I will present 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.459
 videos made case of a mac rap and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.410
 et cetera and so on 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.450
 this video I will be illiez videos 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.470
 also irène good here we are here it is 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:37.750
 a presentation 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:38.919
 short 2.2 less mac rate so if the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.620
 video presentation not what I do 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.240
 a lot of videos with and then for you 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.820
 understand a little it's who this fear 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.350
 these characteristics etc so I think 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.660
 that it is me this base it will be 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.980
 always commented videos and 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.240
 buttocks like a crazy I think of fact 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.320
 as sea ​​lions commented videos of 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.850
 videos and so here's voila it was 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.880
 a bow rent build so do not forget 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.400
 the green thumb to encourage me and the 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.350
 milks to subscribe souplet because 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.620
 it encourages me and more buttons and 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.800
 youtube so here I feel there the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.800
 next
