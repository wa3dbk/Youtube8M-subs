00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.740
 it will be half a cup of tomato juice with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.880
 clams a juice or the juice of a lemon

 and a glass with a plate 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.700
 The first thing we will do is frost the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.210
 glass nozzle and we'll do it from the 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.730

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.980

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.660
 Half a lemon will come together for the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.640
 nozzle 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.640
 and we will go through the plate 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.980
 well and we will stay this way 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.620

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.620

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.329

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.140
 the lemon juice 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.780
 and we will put approximately 1 to 2 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.690

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.690

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.740
 and we will move a little 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.549
