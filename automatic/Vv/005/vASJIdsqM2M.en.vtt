back and forth through the same stitches

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.460 
back and forth through the same stitches
until<00:01:04.159> you<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.670> three<00:01:06.300> foundation<00:01:07.080> threats

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
until you have three foundation threats

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.030 
until you have three foundation threats
this<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> second<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.870> last<00:01:10.140> time

the lower court you can pick any stage

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:21.809 
the lower court you can pick any stage
that<00:02:13.180> works<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:21.010> first<00:02:21.310> foundation

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
that works for you the first foundation

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.199 
that works for you the first foundation
thread<00:02:22.329> is<00:02:22.510> made<00:02:23.010> now<00:02:24.010> insert<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.849> needle

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
thread is made now insert the needle

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.089 
thread is made now insert the needle
into<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.630> space<00:02:25.989> between<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.500> last<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
into the space between the last and the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.130 
into the space between the last and the
previous<00:02:27.549> buttonhole<00:02:28.030> stitches<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.870> were

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
previous buttonhole stitches that were

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.199 
previous buttonhole stitches that were
made<00:02:29.410> before<00:02:29.680> around<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.549> first<00:02:30.760> foundation

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
made before around the first foundation

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.670 
made before around the first foundation
and<00:02:31.690> go<00:02:32.650> through<00:02:33.099> as<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.290> see<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:35.620> we

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
and go through as you can see now we

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.400 
and go through as you can see now we
have<00:02:35.950> two<00:02:36.220> foundation<00:02:36.940> threads<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
have two foundation threads of the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.680 
have two foundation threads of the
second<00:02:38.829> branch<00:02:39.130> before<00:02:40.030> we<00:02:40.090> make<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.420> third

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
second branch before we make the third

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.180 
second branch before we make the third
one<00:02:40.989> let's<00:02:41.200> fix<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.709> part<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.329> thing

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
one let's fix this part with the thing

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.890 
one let's fix this part with the thing
so<00:02:45.190> then<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:45.549> can<00:02:45.760> hold<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.329> thread<00:02:46.690> without

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
so then we can hold the thread without

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.129 
so then we can hold the thread without
deforming<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.920> whole<00:02:48.160> piece<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.810> need<00:02:49.989> to

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
deforming the whole piece we need to

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.599 
deforming the whole piece we need to
make<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.500> foundation<00:02:51.160> with<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> right

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
make the foundation with the right

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.420 
make the foundation with the right
tension<00:02:52.329> then<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.829> needle<00:02:54.190> go<00:02:54.400> through

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
tension then with the needle go through

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.520 
tension then with the needle go through
the<00:02:54.819> same<00:02:55.090> stage<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.319> lower<00:02:56.560> court<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the same stage of the lower court the
