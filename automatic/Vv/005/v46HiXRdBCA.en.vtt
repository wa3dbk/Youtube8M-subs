00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 good to all I'm here in a video 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.770
 It's worth a video tutorial to upload 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.420
 level I will make you many videos of this type 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.280
 since there are many objects that still do not 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.070
 I know I am not of maximum level and above 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 I do not think you 're the fastest way 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.469
 to climb but I think it is a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.780
 of the best ones that I will explain 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 the krafft that we are going to do here is going to 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.779
 be this ballet the hole where we can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
 place several barriers or whatever without 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.109
 have to use it foundation the acute 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.460
 tension you see John I think it's one of the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.070
 characters that give pretty good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
 experience one with two and have some 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.910
 materials to make it quite poor 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 three of stats that is taken out in swimmer's 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.370
 fiber and ten of wood each traffic of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 this will give us 12 points I think 13 I think 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 it's a pretty good figure a bit low 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 thinking that the notes in the beginning 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 they gave a point but well I've seen a lot 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.469
 people who go up making walls the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.870
 which give you one of experience and are 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.789
 much more difficult to do 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.020
 well then as you can see although it is a 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.640
 Crazy a bit slow you can leave 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.870
 doing it is not like the notes 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.660
 previously you had to cancel 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.570
 and as you can see, it gives a point with two or 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 one with three one figures and another thing that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.390
 I wanted to tell you about this crafter is that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.280
 you can break it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.470
 to get a third of the material that you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.690
 gave something that is not bad because 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 example holds so you can get 33 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.790
 more thanks to that for what you can 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.420
 flip one third more of the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.729
 materials that you had then as you see 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.240
 we demolish it quickly if it leaves us what 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.060
 demolition Man 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.259
 and he gives us half of the wood in 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.850
 reality in the matter gives us half 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.200
 thing that is I believe the most important thing 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.700
 because taxi fiber we can have a lot 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.970
 more than give us half of the wood 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.439
 when thatcher we can have lots 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.020
 it practically means that we can 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.149
 do double and not a third like me 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 I thought so I think it's pretty 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.920
 ok kraft is just that because the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.179
 quite experience and above we can 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.500
 take out many more materials breaking the 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.549
 since it is not a very useful thing 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.200
 although we can use it to 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.030
 build and good also videos of this 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 type with more character os for others 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.569
 lower level levels continues to create 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.340
 some other character to be tested if 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.259
 there is a low level kraft that is more 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.880
 useful or whatever and we'll see 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.270
 soon in other literal like this until 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.270
 so
