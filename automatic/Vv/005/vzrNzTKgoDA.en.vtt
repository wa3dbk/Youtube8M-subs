00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
small to medium sized maps the cool

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.090 
small to medium sized maps the cool
thing<00:03:23.870> about<00:03:23.900> baby<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.560> though<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.740> that<00:03:24.890> if

thing about baby of though is that if

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.220 
thing about baby of though is that if
you<00:03:25.190> complete<00:03:25.460> a<00:03:25.490> field<00:03:25.790> order<00:03:26.080> you'll<00:03:27.080> have

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
you complete a field order you'll have

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.410 
you complete a field order you'll have
the<00:03:27.500> ability<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:27.920> use<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.730> naval<00:03:29.030> ships<00:03:29.270> at

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
the ability to use the naval ships at

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630 
the ability to use the naval ships at
around<00:03:29.600> at<00:03:29.780> sea<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.800> an<00:03:31.010> aerial<00:03:31.370> strike

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
around at sea to have an aerial strike

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.820 
around at sea to have an aerial strike
on<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.510> map<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.260> think<00:03:33.470> that's<00:03:33.590> really

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
on the map and I think that's really

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.860 
on the map and I think that's really
cool<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.100> watch<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:35.030> next<00:03:35.180> map<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.600> we<00:03:35.690> have

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
cool to watch the next map that we have

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.840 
cool to watch the next map that we have
is<00:03:36.110> called<00:03:36.290> fog<00:03:36.590> which<00:03:37.010> is<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.430> think<00:03:37.460> going<00:03:37.760> to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
is called fog which is I think going to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.400 
is called fog which is I think going to
be<00:03:37.940> in<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:38.120> fan<00:03:38.510> favorite<00:03:38.870> because<00:03:39.020> it's<00:03:39.320> a

be in this fan favorite because it's a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.340 
be in this fan favorite because it's a
small<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.770> medium<00:03:39.800> sized<00:03:40.280> map<00:03:40.520> as<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:42.170> has

you earned the then and I'm in a nap
event<00:04:29.240> for<00:04:29.690> ignition<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:31.490> set<00:04:31.760> up<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:34.000> engine

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
event for ignition you set up the engine

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.310 
event for ignition you set up the engine
in<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.270> Rockets<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.870> anyone<00:04:36.139> that's

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
in the Rockets so anyone that's

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.840 
in the Rockets so anyone that's
underground<00:04:36.830> is<00:04:37.130> going<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.340> be<00:04:37.460> burned

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
underground is going to be burned

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.080 
underground is going to be burned
immediately<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.620> then<00:04:39.860> also<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.580> model<00:04:40.970> one

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
immediately and then also the model one

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.670 
immediately and then also the model one
is<00:04:41.210> containment<00:04:41.630> which<00:04:42.050> takes<00:04:42.320> place<00:04:42.380> in

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
is containment which takes place in

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.020 
is containment which takes place in
Mexico<00:04:42.860> it's<00:04:43.340> another<00:04:43.580> small<00:04:43.880> and

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
Mexico it's another small and

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.110 
Mexico it's another small and
medium-sized<00:04:44.479> map<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:46.160> it's<00:04:46.880> cool<00:04:47.060> because

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
medium-sized map and it's cool because

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.640 
medium-sized map and it's cool because
there's<00:04:47.389> a<00:04:47.479> bridge<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.960> middle<00:04:48.169> that<00:04:48.320> sort

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
there's a bridge in the middle that sort

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.879 
there's a bridge in the middle that sort
of<00:04:48.850> brings<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.270> two<00:04:50.479> sides<00:04:50.840> together<00:04:51.139> there's

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
of brings the two sides together there's

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:53.590 
of brings the two sides together there's
also<00:04:52.070> like<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> riverbed<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.240> can<00:04:53.389> run

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
also like a riverbed that you can run

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.320 
also like a riverbed that you can run
across<00:04:53.900> that's<00:04:54.350> dry<00:04:54.680> and<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.729> cool<00:04:55.940> thing<00:04:55.970> for

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
across that's dry and the cool thing for

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.879 
across that's dry and the cool thing for
that<00:04:56.600> math<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.260> you<00:04:57.410> can<00:04:57.530> call<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.800> an

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
that math is that you can call in an

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.530 
that math is that you can call in an
airstrike<00:04:58.070> that's<00:04:58.639> going<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.880> blow<00:04:59.030> up<00:04:59.210> in<00:04:59.360> a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
airstrike that's going to blow up in a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.830 
airstrike that's going to blow up in a
nuke<00:05:00.220> tank<00:05:01.220> in<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.370> middle<00:05:01.760> of<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.360> bridge<00:05:02.540> it

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
nuke tank in the middle of the bridge it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.150 
nuke tank in the middle of the bridge it
blows<00:05:03.020> out<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.200> bridge<00:05:03.470> he<00:05:03.620> kills<00:05:03.860> everyone

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
blows out the bridge he kills everyone

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.850 
blows out the bridge he kills everyone
around
