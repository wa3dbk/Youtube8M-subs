technical<00:00:37.659> skills<00:00:38.230> I'm<00:00:38.470> gonna<00:00:38.739> glop<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.220> on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
technical skills I'm gonna glop it on

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.270 
technical skills I'm gonna glop it on
there<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.140> nice<00:00:41.379> thing<00:00:41.559> about<00:00:41.650> gesso<00:00:42.070> is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
there now the nice thing about gesso is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.399 
there now the nice thing about gesso is
that<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.879> will<00:00:43.030> retain<00:00:43.269> whatever<00:00:43.540> texture<00:00:44.260> you

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
that it will retain whatever texture you

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.710 
that it will retain whatever texture you
kind<00:00:44.620> of<00:00:44.680> glop<00:00:45.040> into<00:00:45.610> it<00:00:45.760> so<00:00:46.390> I'm<00:00:46.479> just<00:00:46.540> gonna

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
kind of glop into it so I'm just gonna

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.660 
kind of glop into it so I'm just gonna
keep<00:00:46.960> clapping<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.890> putting<00:00:48.220> on<00:00:48.340> there<00:00:48.489> now

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
keep clapping and putting on there now

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
the thicker the coat of gesso the longer

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.139 
the thicker the coat of gesso the longer
it's<00:00:50.530> gonna<00:00:50.590> take<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:51.010> dry<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:51.670> I'm<00:00:51.910> not<00:00:52.059> at

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it's gonna take to dry and I'm not at

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.160 
it's gonna take to dry and I'm not at
all<00:00:52.269> worried<00:00:52.510> about<00:00:52.539> going<00:00:52.719> off<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.019> edges

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
all worried about going off the edges

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.509 
all worried about going off the edges
because<00:00:53.469> I'm<00:00:53.590> working<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.980> this<00:00:54.070> Teflon<00:00:54.489> sheet

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
because I'm working on this Teflon sheet

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.299 
because I'm working on this Teflon sheet
which<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.120> gonna<00:00:55.239> clean<00:00:55.570> up<00:00:55.750> super<00:00:56.079> easy<00:00:56.309> then

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
which is gonna clean up super easy then

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.040 
which is gonna clean up super easy then
I'm<00:00:57.429> gonna<00:00:57.519> take<00:00:57.730> my<00:00:57.789> SuperDuper<00:00:58.359> magical

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
I'm gonna take my SuperDuper magical

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.889 
I'm gonna take my SuperDuper magical
fork<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.559> this<00:01:00.309> Fork<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.910> going<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.690> create

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
fork and this Fork is going to create

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.609 
fork and this Fork is going to create
curvy<00:01:02.649> lines<00:01:02.859> of<00:01:03.730> all<00:01:04.030> kinds<00:01:04.929> it's<00:01:05.410> gonna

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
curvy lines of all kinds it's gonna

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.310 
curvy lines of all kinds it's gonna
create<00:01:05.890> straight<00:01:06.490> lines<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.840> gonna<00:01:08.050> create

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
create straight lines it's gonna create

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.150 
create straight lines it's gonna create
hatch<00:01:08.789> marks<00:01:09.789> you<00:01:10.630> can<00:01:10.750> use<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.990> other<00:01:11.170> end<00:01:11.320> to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
hatch marks you can use the other end to

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.840 
hatch marks you can use the other end to
draw<00:01:12.399> circles<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:14.259> can<00:01:14.289> write<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.710> name<00:01:15.039> how

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
draw circles you can write your name how

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.190 
draw circles you can write your name how
about<00:01:16.030> Julie<00:01:16.720> rocks<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.720> something<00:01:20.080> that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
about Julie rocks and something that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.479 
about Julie rocks and something that
Lynn<00:01:20.380> Pirela<00:01:20.679> told<00:01:20.920> me<00:01:20.979> because<00:01:21.099> I<00:01:21.280> used<00:01:21.429> to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:21.489 
Lynn Pirela told me because I used to

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:22.949 
Lynn Pirela told me because I used to
just<00:01:21.700> leave<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.030> like<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.209> if<00:01:22.539> she<00:01:22.690> said<00:01:22.869> if

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
just leave it like this if she said if

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.050 
just leave it like this if she said if
you<00:01:22.989> break<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.619> up<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.069> a<00:01:24.459> good<00:01:24.670> way<00:01:24.789> to<00:01:24.849> break

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
you break it up and a good way to break

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.999 
you break it up and a good way to break
it<00:01:25.270> up<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.539> just<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.110> take<00:01:26.349> that<00:01:26.380> paint<00:01:26.800> brush

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
it up is just to take that paint brush

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.639 
it up is just to take that paint brush
and<00:01:27.250> slap<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.149> couple<00:01:28.360> times<00:01:28.599> you<00:01:29.500> get<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
and slap it a couple times you get a

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.620 
and slap it a couple times you get a
more<00:01:29.830> interesting<00:01:30.130> design<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.000> think<00:01:31.360> that

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
more interesting design and I think that

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.440 
more interesting design and I think that
she<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.050> right<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.700> what<00:01:33.819> you<00:01:33.940> do<00:01:34.119> once<00:01:34.270> you're

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
she is right so what you do once you're

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.850 
she is right so what you do once you're
satisfied<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.229> texture<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.739> can

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
satisfied with the texture and you can

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.529 
satisfied with the texture and you can
go<00:01:35.950> in<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.310> out<00:01:36.369> as<00:01:36.610> many<00:01:36.819> times<00:01:37.060> as<00:01:37.209> you<00:01:37.360> want

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
go in and out as many times as you want

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.089 
go in and out as many times as you want
playing<00:01:37.959> around<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.800> can<00:01:38.950> also

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
playing around with it you can also

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.910 
playing around with it you can also
stamp<00:01:39.819> into<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.420> just<00:01:41.110> add<00:01:41.229> texture<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:41.770> all

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
stamp into it just add texture of all

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.979 
stamp into it just add texture of all
kinds<00:01:42.399> you're<00:01:43.119> just<00:01:43.239> gonna<00:01:43.330> either<00:01:43.569> gonna<00:01:43.720> let

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
kinds you're just gonna either gonna let

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.080 
kinds you're just gonna either gonna let
that<00:01:44.140> dry<00:01:44.440> or<00:01:44.920> dry<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.220> with<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.429> heat<00:01:45.670> gun<00:01:45.849> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
that dry or dry it with a heat gun and
