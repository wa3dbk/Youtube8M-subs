in the Eastern Conference once again

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.350 
in the Eastern Conference once again
with<00:01:44.159> LeBron<00:01:44.520> owe<00:01:44.549> me<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.240> one

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
with LeBron owe me this is gonna be one

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.580 
with LeBron owe me this is gonna be one
of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> best<00:01:45.659> team<00:01:45.869> he's<00:01:46.020> ever<00:01:46.140> played<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.530> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
of the best team he's ever played with I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.370 
of the best team he's ever played with I
mean<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.250> 2010-11<00:01:48.000> Miami<00:01:48.780> Heat<00:01:48.930> team<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> think

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
mean the 2010-11 Miami Heat team I think

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.630 
mean the 2010-11 Miami Heat team I think
was<00:01:49.470> probably<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:50.009> teams<00:01:50.189> played<00:01:50.460> with

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
was probably the best teams played with

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
was probably the best teams played with
but<00:01:51.119> man<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> serious<00:01:52.590> test<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
but man this will be a serious test for

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.590 
but man this will be a serious test for
the<00:01:53.130> Cavaliers<00:01:53.520> especially<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.149> Kevin<00:01:54.420> Love
