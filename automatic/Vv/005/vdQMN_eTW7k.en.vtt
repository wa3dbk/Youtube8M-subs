feathers<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> string<00:00:17.310> which<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.930> fantastic

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
feathers on a string which is fantastic

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.630 
feathers on a string which is fantastic
because<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.289> makes<00:00:19.439> much<00:00:19.800> easier<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.490> add<00:00:20.609> a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
because it makes much easier to add a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490 
because it makes much easier to add a
bunch<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.119> feathers<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> shirt<00:00:21.930> without

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
bunch of feathers to a shirt without

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
bunch of feathers to a shirt without
having<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.100> them<00:00:23.189> individually<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.330> let's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
having to do them individually so let's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
having to do them individually so let's
take<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> look<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.260> works<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.800> we've

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
take a look at how this works so we've

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.830 
take a look at how this works so we've
got<00:00:26.400> our<00:00:26.490> shirt<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.599> we've

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
got our shirt here and you can see we've

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
got our shirt here and you can see we've
added<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.320> feathers<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.160> onto<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
added some feathers right here onto the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
added some feathers right here onto the
side<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.300> we've<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.539> used<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.109> string<00:00:31.590> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
side and we've just used that string to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.459 
side and we've just used that string to
kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> attach<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> shirt<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.020> I'm

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
kind of attach it to the shirt and I'm

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.590 
kind of attach it to the shirt and I'm
using<00:00:34.680> fabric<00:00:35.100> glue<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> liquid

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
using fabric glue this is a liquid

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350 
using fabric glue this is a liquid
stitch<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.430> non-toxic<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.210> can

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
stitch it's non-toxic and you can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
stitch it's non-toxic and you can
machine<00:00:39.570> wash<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:39.989> dry<00:00:40.290> after<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.980> use<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
machine wash and dry after you use this

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
machine wash and dry after you use this
however<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> feathers<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.960> will

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
however with the feathers they will

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
however with the feathers they will
probably<00:00:43.290> come<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.610> turn

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
probably come off so you want to turn

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
probably come off so you want to turn
the<00:00:45.000> shirt<00:00:45.180> inside<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.690> probably<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the shirt inside out probably put it in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.279 
the shirt inside out probably put it in
a<00:00:46.890> pillowcase<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.390> wash<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.809> but

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
a pillowcase if you if you wash it but

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.100 
a pillowcase if you if you wash it but
beware<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.340> may<00:00:50.520> still<00:00:50.820> lose<00:00:51.000> feathers<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
beware you may still lose feathers so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.209 
beware you may still lose feathers so
we're<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> take<00:00:52.500> our<00:00:52.680> liquid<00:00:52.860> stitch

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
we're going to take our liquid stitch

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.830 
we're going to take our liquid stitch
and<00:00:53.489> we're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> simply<00:00:54.149> put<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> nice

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and we're going to simply put a nice

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.369 
and we're going to simply put a nice
line<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.280> top<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:59.930> there<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
line right up top and there we go it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
line right up top and there we go it
squeezes<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.219> nicely<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.910> then

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
squeezes out really nicely and then

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
squeezes out really nicely and then
we're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> take<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.409> doubling<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> up

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we're going to take I'm doubling it up

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 
we're going to take I'm doubling it up
this<00:01:05.670> time<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> nice<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> bunch<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
this time so we get a nice a bunch of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.070 
this time so we get a nice a bunch of
feathers<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> hold<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> both

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
feathers and I like to hold it on both

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.260 
feathers and I like to hold it on both
sides<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.490> lay<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> down<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.680> just

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
sides and then just lay it down and just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.899 
sides and then just lay it down and just
Pat<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:16.159> now<00:01:17.159> sometimes<00:01:17.549> you'll<00:01:17.670> have<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
Pat it down now sometimes you'll have to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.700 
Pat it down now sometimes you'll have to
go<00:01:18.030> back<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> reinforce<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.380> add<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> little

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
go back and reinforce and add a little

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.460 
go back and reinforce and add a little
bit<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.159> glue<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> works<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.320> well

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
bit more glue but it works really well

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
bit more glue but it works really well
and<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.640> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.850> come<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.060> with

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and you can kind of come up with

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
and you can kind of come up with
whatever<00:01:24.810> design<00:01:25.290> works<00:01:25.650> well<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
whatever design works well for you and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
whatever design works well for you and
if<00:01:27.450> you're<00:01:27.570> working<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.020> loose<00:01:28.470> feather

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
if you're working with loose feather

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.920 
if you're working with loose feather
that's<00:01:29.250> okay<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.790> still<00:01:29.909> use<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> fabric

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that's okay you can still use the fabric

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
that's okay you can still use the fabric
glue<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.619> we're<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> take<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> add

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
glue so we're just going to take and add

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.390 
glue so we're just going to take and add
a<00:01:32.939> little<00:01:33.210> fabric<00:01:33.600> glue<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> then

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
a little fabric glue up here and then

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
a little fabric glue up here and then
I'm<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> end<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.049> feather

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
I'm going to take the end of the feather

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
I'm going to take the end of the feather
which<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.610> hard<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.150> they're<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which is so hard to see they're so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.969 
which is so hard to see they're so
fluffy<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.110> stick<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.460> there

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
fluffy and stick it right in there

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
fluffy and stick it right in there
and<00:01:43.979> while<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.549> feather<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.939> stay<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.750> make

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and while the feather will stay so make

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.450 
and while the feather will stay so make
sure<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.200> dries<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> way<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
sure it dries all the way and I know
