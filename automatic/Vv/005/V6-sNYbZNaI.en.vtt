00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.149
 I was waiting sitting on the sand 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.099
 the advanced one guarantees that the works could have presented itself well 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.189
 starting from scratch 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.959
 This good walk 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.329

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.899
 We are going to work so that the outcome 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:29.120
 Neither life in two countries says whoever has a thigh injury 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.120
 I need to make a very sound for example 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.969
 for practice workshops that the main objective is to make you play 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.430
 understood in the second traveling a lot and theory that is very important 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.380
 but the main focus 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.829
 helsinki 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.510
 the pleasure of playing harmonica 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.660

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.660
 we do socially educate 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.069

 already adilson for example 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.110
 this must demonize doing good already on the line 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.269
 the setting 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.279
 Why am I going to do it? 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.519
 with time 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.109
 for example that already exists 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.459
 money 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.459
 seems simple using well 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 along with what happened, says almeida 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.729

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.419
 given to Italy, the long-term 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.419
 times, for example, luckily nothing 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.310
 we must also have done the best you deserve the leader takes over
