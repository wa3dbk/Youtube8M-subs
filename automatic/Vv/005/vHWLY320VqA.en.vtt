00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 well this is the third part of the video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.600
 and we will talk about 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.600
 but how smart is that 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.110
 good if we talk about myths and legends 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 now diverting us more towards what is 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.560
 the atari and all those shits 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.600
 we will start with the tea sets 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.110
 buried in the desert again 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.960
 Mexico 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.430
 this is how you have listened to the legend 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.800
 says that when the movie premiered 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.869
 of those of atari thought that the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.060
 people were going to buy a lot 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.950
 copies of the game even made more 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.960
 copies of games that consoles there were 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.300
 in the world so everything went to the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.760
 shit the game was pointless without 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.800
 emotion without fun besides that was coming 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.809
 with a big mistake that was that a world 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 you had to pass a big hole in the floor 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.160
 that you can not pass it in any way 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.350
 if it fell there the screen would lock and the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.079
 only solution was throwing the atari by 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.850
 the window pardon resetting the xd then 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.010
 of this there was no other option than 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.809
 burying them in the desert until 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.899
 They put a sign that said here 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.850
 rest and you and your good family is 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.710
 Legend below is that of me 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.870
 I want to say this this myth is that of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.030
 crash bandicoot it is said that the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.790
 producers and creators of the fox 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 famous of all sold their rights to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.510
 others making you change the look of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.150
 class and its attacks 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.880
 more than his legendary espn attack was 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.460
 modified by stupid hits more than 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.860
 to get the spin you needed to have 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.960
 a certain amount of mucus more than when 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.480
 I made the spin to the two tidal turns 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.610
 you give one thing that never happened in any 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.100
 another delivery of house the characters 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.090
 they were modified between them are 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.850
 coco cruise doctor cortex in hellÃ­n a 4 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.370
 or cauca among others plus the only good thing 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.470
 is that they put a tulle hairstyle and 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.810
 motherfucker tattoos these mistakes 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.510
 vital started from the last 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.940
 cash crash of the titans 1 and 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.520
 after of the titans that despite more 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.070
 these two new deliveries were not so 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.100
 fun as the others exist now 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.140
 it will touch me, this legend is the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.300
 Mario and his weird suit a video 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.610
 shows on youtube as supposedly 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.740
 with a magical movement we access a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 secret place in which we would get a 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.510
 special suit never seen before called 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.190
 several laser suit the video is pretty 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.140
 credible and it does it even more since the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.810
 Most people never got 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.530
 one hundred percent of the game the truth is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.930
 that the video 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 but it is a mod for super mario 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.250
 world here the video 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.310
 for a day 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.400
 but after 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400
 ah 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.260
 but 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.560
 the game that in between when to heal 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.560
 you make king 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.430
 way 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.920
 again 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.000
 the mother I want that suit but not 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.009
 I can because as it has already been clarified it is 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.709
 a monkey can kill the dog of 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.720
 google you remember that mythical game of 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.460
 of hunting ducks and that was played with 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.169
 a gun that was plugged into the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.479
 nintendo and we were shooting at the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.520
 screen had a pretty dog 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.830
 insidious that he did not stop laughing every 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.320
 time we failed but we could not 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.509
 shoot him there was no way to kill him 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.970
 to make him shut up more than one had him 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.979
 you win the dog started running the 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.660
 urban legend that you could kill the 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.340
 dog but there's no way 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.889
 I think that this is pure legend 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.410
 urban because the dog is immortal 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.240
 hey tails today you did not speak I promise you that 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.670
 for the next part I'll talk damn 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.280
 mother 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.470
 I have discovered a subliminal message in 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.470
 a series that never clarified this
