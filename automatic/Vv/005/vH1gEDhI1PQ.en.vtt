00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
a little odd in my opinion but it's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.670 
scarecrow in this one I like the old set
a<00:01:21.299> lot<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.900> was<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.380> cool

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
a lot I think it was really really cool

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.920 
a lot I think it was really really cool
on<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.430> old<00:01:23.640> version<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> didn't<00:01:24.810> have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
on this old version and you didn't have

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
on this old version and you didn't have
the<00:01:25.049> old<00:01:25.229> style<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.890> flick<00:01:26.130> fire<00:01:26.340> missiles<00:01:26.759> on

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the old style of flick fire missiles on

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.810 
the old style of flick fire missiles on
here<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.450> these<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.930> fall<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.829> rather<00:01:29.250> easily

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
here so these do fall out rather easily

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.649 
here so these do fall out rather easily
but<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.590> older<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
but I like this older one a lot at the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.020

three blades on the top which looks a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450

you'll<00:02:27.230> also<00:02:27.440> notice<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.280> new<00:02:28.430> one

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
you'll also notice on the new one

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.820 
you'll also notice on the new one
the<00:02:29.240> wheels<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.840> closer<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.470> front

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
the wheels are closer to the front

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.160 
the wheels are closer to the front
that's<00:02:31.730> your<00:02:31.910> wheel<00:02:32.120> setup<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> new<00:02:32.930> one

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
that's your wheel setup on the new one

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.590 
that's your wheel setup on the new one
and<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.520> let<00:02:34.610> me<00:02:34.700> pick<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.000> old<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.300> back<00:02:35.420> up

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
and then let me pick the old one back up

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.750 
and then let me pick the old one back up
we'll<00:02:36.530> set<00:02:36.770> up<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> old<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> bit

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
we'll set up on the old one is a bit

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.060 
we'll set up on the old one is a bit
different<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.990> back<00:02:39.170> wheel<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.650> all<00:02:39.770> the<00:02:39.980> way

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
different the back wheel was all the way

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.100 
different the back wheel was all the way
back<00:02:40.250> here<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.510> kind<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.750> sits<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.020> little

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
back here so it kind of sits a little

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.410 
back here so it kind of sits a little
bit<00:02:42.230> different<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.340> see<00:02:43.550> all<00:02:44.209> that

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
bit different and see all that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.650 
bit different and see all that
difference<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.670> when<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.760> set<00:02:46.940> them<00:02:47.060> down<00:02:47.120> I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
difference is when you set them down I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.630 
difference is when you set them down I
like<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.500> way<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.770> new<00:02:48.920> one<00:02:49.100> sits<00:02:49.370> up<00:02:49.520> a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
like the way the new one sits up a

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.530 
like the way the new one sits up a
little<00:02:49.820> bit<00:02:49.970> more<00:02:50.750> kind<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.769> cool<00:02:51.950> but<00:02:52.760> they

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
little bit more kind of cool but they

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.080 
little bit more kind of cool but they
are<00:02:53.780> both<00:02:53.989> very<00:02:54.050> awesome<00:02:54.800> sets<00:02:55.100> so<00:02:55.700> let<00:02:55.970> me

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
are both very awesome sets so let me

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.330
