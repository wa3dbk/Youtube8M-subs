00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.740 
bringing you an intro competition this
is<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.299> first<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.740> done<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
is the first one I would have done and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
is the first one I would have done and
the<00:00:18.750> reason<00:00:18.990> I'm<00:00:19.050> doing<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.760> those<00:00:20.760> two

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the reason I'm doing it is those two

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.740 
the reason I'm doing it is those two
reasons<00:00:21.830> 60k<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.029> video<00:00:24.300> for<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
reasons 60k this is the video for the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.040 
reasons 60k this is the video for the
60k<00:00:25.789> it's<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.390> classed<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
60k it's just not really classed as it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
60k it's just not really classed as it
because<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.310> around<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
because I don't really get around to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
because I don't really get around to
doing<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.880> straight<00:00:30.119> away<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:31.260> will<00:00:31.410> be

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
doing it straight away but this will be

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.000
