00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
in 2012 when we turn to DTM you said

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.119 
in 2012 when we turn to DTM you said
that<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.879> didn't<00:00:35.210> expect<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.899> be<00:00:36.129> so

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
that you didn't expect to be so

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.619

TTM<00:00:42.640> did<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:43.760> expect<00:00:44.059> to<00:00:44.210> do<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:44.600> any<00:00:44.780> light

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
TTM did you expect to do so any light

TTM did you expect to do so any light
understand<00:00:45.620> no<00:00:46.550> definitely<00:00:47.120> not<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:47.600> i<00:00:47.750> said

understand no definitely not as i said
before<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:48.500> never<00:00:48.710> know<00:00:48.980> exactly<00:00:49.610> where<00:00:50.360> you

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
before you never know exactly where you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.509 
before you never know exactly where you
are<00:00:50.540> compared<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.379> competition<00:00:52.070> when<00:00:52.220> you<00:00:52.309> do

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
are compared to competition when you do

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.700 
are compared to competition when you do
the<00:00:52.699> development<00:00:53.210> steps<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:53.900> all<00:00:54.079> did<00:00:54.320> big

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
the development steps and we all did big

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.130 
the development steps and we all did big
developments<00:00:55.370> x<00:00:55.579> over<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:56.000> winter<00:00:56.360> clearly

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
developments x over the winter clearly

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.899 
developments x over the winter clearly
fast<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:57.619> was<00:00:57.769> all<00:00:57.979> so<00:00:58.189> different<00:00:58.339> because<00:00:58.699> we

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
fast it was all so different because we

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.020 
fast it was all so different because we
introduce<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.750> new<00:00:59.900> car<00:01:00.619> with<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:00.979> m4<00:01:02.409> so<00:01:03.409> so

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
introduce the new car with the m4 so so

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.140 
introduce the new car with the m4 so so
it<00:01:05.030> was<00:01:05.299> not<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:06.320> was<00:01:06.350> not<00:01:06.560> clear<00:01:06.740> what<00:01:07.460> what

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
it was not it was not clear what what

it was not it was not clear what what
the<00:01:08.360> let's<00:01:09.350> say<00:01:09.530> performance<00:01:11.860> variance<00:01:12.860> would

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the let's say performance variance would

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.910 
the let's say performance variance would
be<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.330> respect<00:01:14.619> I'm<00:01:15.619> definitely

very<00:01:16.520> happy<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.360> way<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.780> has<00:01:18.259> panned<00:01:18.650> out<00:01:18.830> but

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
very happy the way it has panned out but

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.590 
very happy the way it has panned out but
on<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:21.470> side<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.040> know<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.970> you've<00:01:23.270> learned

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
on one side you know and you've learned

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.200 
on one side you know and you've learned
with<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.140> m3<00:01:24.619> over<00:01:25.009> 2<00:01:25.189> years<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.579> lot<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.000> things

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
with the m3 over 2 years a lot of things

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.060 
with the m3 over 2 years a lot of things
which<00:01:26.689> went<00:01:27.020> obviously<00:01:27.680> into<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
which went obviously into the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.730 
which went obviously into the
development<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.030> end<00:01:29.180> for<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.170> until<00:01:30.440> you

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
development of the end for but until you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.830 
development of the end for but until you
run<00:01:30.920> properly<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:32.240> race<00:01:32.420> weekend

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840

to<00:01:50.540> say<00:01:50.720> obviously<00:01:50.930> all<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.410> common<00:01:51.740> parts

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
to say obviously all the common parts

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.880 
to say obviously all the common parts
completing<00:01:53.030> stay<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.450> same<00:01:53.630> but<00:01:53.900> clearly<00:01:54.650> we

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
completing stay the same but clearly we

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.810 
completing stay the same but clearly we
have<00:01:55.040> worked<00:01:55.310> on<00:01:55.540> suspension<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:56.990> geometries

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
have worked on suspension on geometries

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.260 
have worked on suspension on geometries
on<00:01:58.820> things<00:02:00.100> regarding<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.220> mechanical<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
on things regarding the mechanical the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.220 
on things regarding the mechanical the
mechanical<00:02:03.550> working<00:02:04.550> of<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.730> car<00:02:05.120> but<00:02:05.930> this

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
mechanical working of the car but this

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.190 
mechanical working of the car but this
was<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:06.800> an<00:02:07.160> evolutionary<00:02:08.030> process<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:08.930> so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
was really an evolutionary process so so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.750 
was really an evolutionary process so so
everything<00:02:09.680> that<00:02:09.710> we've<00:02:10.040> learned<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.610> we've

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
everything that we've learned and we've

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.990 
everything that we've learned and we've
identified<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.840> we've<00:02:12.020> analyzed<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
identified and we've analyzed the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.450 
identified and we've analyzed the
performance<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.470> performance<00:02:15.500> window

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
performance and the performance window

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.660 
performance and the performance window
of<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.850> angry<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.830> out<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.430> we

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
of the angry and and out of this we

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.880 
of the angry and and out of this we
derived<00:02:20.060> targets<00:02:21.020> for<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.350> end<00:02:21.620> for

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
derived targets for the end for

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.940 
derived targets for the end for
development<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.760> i<00:02:23.300> would<00:02:23.840> say<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.830> have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
development and i would say that we have

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.250 
development and i would say that we have
achieved<00:02:25.070> most<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.940> our<00:02:26.060> targets<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:26.990> set

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
achieved most of our targets that we set

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
achieved most of our targets that we set
as<00:02:27.500> goals<00:02:27.770> from<00:02:29.320> evolutionary<00:02:30.320> step<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.980> free
