Hello my subscribers and those who just came to my channel

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:08.000
Today I gonna show you how I make my curls

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.000
if you are interested then stay with me

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:16.000
Title: Curls? easy!

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:26.000
To create my curls I use the conical curling iron from Babyliss

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.000
This rotating wire is very convenient

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
And it has a temperature control, whole 10 modes

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:37.000
Max temperature is 200 degrees!

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:42.600
Due to this leg, I can leave the hot iron on the table without worrying

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.000
You should not forget that our hair needs a thermal protection

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:52.000
I use the protection by Ga.ma. It smells like peaches

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, at least I think so =)

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.000
And it also has a very handy sprayer

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:03.000
I spray a little bit on my clean hair without any fixing cosmetics

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.000
Brush your hair to make protection the same everywhere

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:13.000
And we can start. I divide my hair into two parts and take the farest lock of hair.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.500
It's harder to reel it up so I prefer to start with it

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:22.500
I hold the widest part of curling irom at a distance of about 5-7 cm from the scalp

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.000
Reel the lock of hair up to a cone holding the hair ends

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.800
You can use gloves, but I can get around without it

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:34.000
Hold the lock like this during 20 seconds

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:40.000
then carefully extract the iron

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
and here it is!

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:47.000
I am holding it a bit in my hand to let it cool down and release.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.000
In the same way I reel the rest locks up

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:55.000
In fact I love to make curls but I don't do it very often

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.000
because it actually damage the hair

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.000
But unfortunately this is the only way for me to reel it up,

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:06.500
Because I've tried so many ways and there is no suitable to my hair

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.500
And with curling iron my hairdo keeps 2-3 days

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.000
and now I leave you for a while, enjoy the process

00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:29.000
Yeah! Last curl is ready. The whole process took me less than 20 minutes

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:35.000
Use your fingers or a comb with wide teeth to carefully comb the locks

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:40.000
But don't use the regular comb, because you can become like a sheep :)

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.000
yes I know what I'm talking about

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:45.000
My curls are ready!

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:50.000
You can make a lot of very beautiful, simple and elegant hairstyles

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:54.000
The hair is getting very voluminous

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:00.000
but I like to let my curls fell on my shoulders

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.000
Beautiful, is n't it?

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:07.000
I love you guys! Bye!
