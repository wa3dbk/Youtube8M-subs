this spoke design it's a good-looking

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.980 
this spoke design it's a good-looking
wheel<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.540> my<00:02:24.540> thing<00:02:24.810> is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
wheel as you can see and my thing is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.800 
wheel as you can see and my thing is
this<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> 300<00:02:26.580> horsepower<00:02:26.850> v6<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.660> don't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
this is a 300 horsepower v6 so you don't

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.840 
this is a 300 horsepower v6 so you don't
really<00:02:27.990> need<00:02:28.260> performance<00:02:28.860> brakes<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.700> my

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
really need performance brakes but my

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.330 
really need performance brakes but my
thing<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:31.320> probably<00:02:31.620> want<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.890> paint<00:02:32.130> your

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
thing is you probably want to paint your

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.790 
thing is you probably want to paint your
rotor<00:02:32.580> calipers<00:02:33.209> if<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.480> was<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.650> had

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
rotor calipers if I was you and you had

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.290 
rotor calipers if I was you and you had
a<00:02:34.830> color<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.910> paint<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
a color like this I would paint the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.080 
a color like this I would paint the
calipers<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.020> same<00:02:37.260> color<00:02:37.620> blue<00:02:37.950> as<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.850> car

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
calipers the same color blue as this car

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.520 
calipers the same color blue as this car
because<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> would<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:39.930> help<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.380> stand

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
because that would really help it stand

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.050 
because that would really help it stand
out<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.890> road<00:02:41.160> even<00:02:41.400> though<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> doesn't

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
now my only problem is there's no outlet
there's<00:02:57.090> no<00:02:57.209> 12-volt<00:02:58.050> outlet<00:02:58.260> right<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:59.190> if

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
there's no 12-volt outlet right here if

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.770 
there's no 12-volt outlet right here if
there<00:02:59.459> was<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> 12-volt<00:03:00.030> outlet<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.630> would

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
there was a 12-volt outlet that would

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.390 
there was a 12-volt outlet that would
really<00:03:01.019> be<00:03:01.320> awesome<00:03:01.860> too

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really be awesome too

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
can plug in dual USB charges because a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.380 
can plug in dual USB charges because a
lot<00:03:07.560> of<00:03:07.590> those<00:03:07.739> 12-volt<00:03:08.280> plugs<00:03:08.550> all<00:03:08.850> four<00:03:09.090> USB

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
this is the typical steering wheel they

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.439 
this is the typical steering wheel they
started<00:04:38.560> using<00:04:39.039> these<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.699> jeeps<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.360> the

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.409 
or Finance prepared I think this color
and<00:05:49.559> I<00:05:49.649> think<00:05:49.860> this<00:05:50.009> design<00:05:50.370> will<00:05:50.699> hold<00:05:50.969> up<00:05:51.180> for

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
and I think this design will hold up for

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.510 
and I think this design will hold up for
six<00:05:51.689> year<00:05:51.839> finance<00:05:52.259> period<00:05:52.620> until<00:05:53.129> newer

six year finance period until newer

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.489 
six year finance period until newer
