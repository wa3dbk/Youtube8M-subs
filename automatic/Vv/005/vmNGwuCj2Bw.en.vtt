is<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> bit<00:02:23.620> weird<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.510> can't<00:02:25.510> do<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
is a bit weird but I can't do this

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.630 
is a bit weird but I can't do this
correctly<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.560> now<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.739> select<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.250> new<00:02:30.400> point

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
correctly so now we select a new point

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.280 
correctly so now we select a new point
that's<00:02:30.849> two<00:02:30.940> point<00:02:31.209> one<00:02:31.630> you're<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.140> like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that's two point one you're just like

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.979 
that's two point one you're just like
both<00:02:32.440> points<00:02:32.829> for<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:34.540> set<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.810> top

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
both points for this one we set the top

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.949 
both points for this one we set the top
left<00:02:35.260> corner<00:02:35.530> then<00:02:36.040> we<00:02:36.099> do<00:02:36.220> paste<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.780> we'll

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
left corner then we do paste and we'll

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.309 
left corner then we do paste and we'll
paste<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:39.280> may<00:02:39.519> have<00:02:39.670> cut<00:02:39.940> out<00:02:40.200> bit<00:02:41.200> of

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
paste it and it may have cut out bit of

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.380 
paste it and it may have cut out bit of
the<00:02:41.500> other<00:02:41.680> one<00:02:41.859> so<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.880> need<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> do<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.209> one

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the other one so we need to do it one

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.890 
the other one so we need to do it one
out<00:02:43.569> more<00:02:44.250> let's<00:02:45.250> do<00:02:45.430> /<00:02:45.760> -<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:46.299> doing<00:02:46.569> mr.

1 break that and paste now I've still

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.869 
1 break that and paste now I've still
did<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.109> okay

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:09.050 

do<00:03:00.720> another<00:03:00.989> one<00:03:06.709> there<00:03:07.709> we<00:03:07.799> go<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.760> now<00:03:08.790> it's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
do another one there we go so now it's

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.780 
do another one there we go so now it's
even<00:03:09.329> got<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.019> same<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.500> from<00:03:10.799> above<00:03:11.099> to

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
even got the same thing from above to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.449 
even got the same thing from above to
the<00:03:11.879> top<00:03:12.090> which<00:03:12.269> adds<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.659> new<00:03:12.890> layer<00:03:13.890> which<00:03:14.340> is

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the top which adds a new layer which is

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.309 
the top which adds a new layer which is
pretty<00:03:14.700> cool

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
pretty cool

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.330 
pretty cool
regardless<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.470> other<00:03:16.590> games<00:03:16.799> like<00:03:16.890> drained

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
regardless of other games like drained

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
regardless of other games like drained
so<00:03:17.730> if<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:17.879> find<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> large<00:03:18.360> water<00:03:18.690> source<00:03:18.989> for

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so if we find a large water source for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.720 
so if we find a large water source for
example<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.010> ocean<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:23.040> yes<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.459> did

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
example the ocean and yes I just did

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.509 
example the ocean and yes I just did
just<00:03:23.970> randomly<00:03:24.510> fall<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.349> ocean<00:03:25.400> are<00:03:26.400> you

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
just randomly fall in the ocean are you

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.649 
just randomly fall in the ocean are you
/<00:03:26.760> -<00:03:26.790> drain<00:03:29.060> there<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.180> like<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.329> points

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
/ - drain there just like the points

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.690 
/ - drain there just like the points
first<00:03:30.930> thing<00:03:31.859> like<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:34.099> we<00:03:35.099> can<00:03:35.220> go<00:03:35.370> down

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
first thing like that we can go down

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.030 
first thing like that we can go down
here<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:38.000> it's<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.180> drain<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.170> should

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
here and it's not just drain it should

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420 
here and it's not just drain it should
get<00:03:41.849> rid<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> water<00:03:42.299> here<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:44.069> I<00:03:44.129> get<00:03:44.280> rid

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
get rid of the water here so I get rid

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.199 
get rid of the water here so I get rid
of<00:03:44.489> water<00:03:45.019> then<00:03:46.019> we've<00:03:46.139> got<00:03:46.700> we<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.790> help<00:03:48.060> for

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
of water then we've got we have help for

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.410 
of water then we've got we have help for
that<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.980> lot<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.069> other<00:03:50.250> stuff<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:50.760> cut<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.359> if

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
that a lot of other stuff is cut so if

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.289 
that a lot of other stuff is cut so if
you<00:03:51.510> wanna<00:03:51.629> get<00:03:51.720> rid<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:51.989> something<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:52.739> I

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
you wanna get rid of something so like I

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.660 
you wanna get rid of something so like I
would<00:03:54.299> have<00:03:54.359> got<00:03:54.480> rid<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.629> that<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:59.519> can

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
would have got rid of that you can

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.180 
would have got rid of that you can
name<00:03:59.849> the<00:04:00.000> block<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:02.900> would<00:04:03.900> say<00:04:04.079> -<00:04:04.470> sand<00:04:04.799> make

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
name the block I would say - sand make

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.740 
name the block I would say - sand make
it<00:04:05.310> bigger<00:04:05.489> smaller<00:04:06.090> ocean<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.090> if<00:04:09.599> you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
it bigger smaller ocean if you if you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.689 
it bigger smaller ocean if you if you
set<00:04:10.049> something<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.769> like<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.889> slopes<00:04:11.340> cut

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
set something and it's like a slopes cut

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.020 
set something and it's like a slopes cut
into<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.060> I'll<00:04:12.690> give<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.840> an<00:04:13.019> example<00:04:13.109> I'm

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
into it I'll give you an example I'm

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.110 
into it I'll give you an example I'm
gonna<00:04:15.030> set<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.419> dirt<00:04:16.579> as<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.760> can<00:04:17.849> see<00:04:18.000> on

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
gonna set that to dirt as you can see on

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.089 
gonna set that to dirt as you can see on
this<00:04:18.239> side<00:04:18.510> we<00:04:18.660> have<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> little<00:04:18.900> slope<00:04:19.380> inside

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
this side we have a little slope inside

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:26.540 
this side we have a little slope inside
this<00:04:20.570> there<00:04:21.570> two<00:04:21.900> slopes<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:23.599> fix<00:04:24.599> slopes<00:04:25.550> and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
this there two slopes you fix slopes and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.460 
this there two slopes you fix slopes and
it's<00:04:26.699> also<00:04:26.940> have<00:04:27.180> sometimes<00:04:27.570> fixed<00:04:28.139> halves

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
it's also have sometimes fixed halves

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.939 
it's also have sometimes fixed halves
and<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:28.919> think<00:04:29.070> thing<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.490> block<00:04:29.729> but

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
and I think thing in this block but

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.930 
and I think thing in this block but
sometimes<00:04:31.949> there<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.330> okay<00:04:34.760> that's<00:04:35.760> pretty

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940
