the<00:00:22.020> 3<00:00:22.760> raised<00:00:23.760> bed<00:00:24.119> gardens<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.350> built

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
the 3 raised bed gardens that I built

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
the 3 raised bed gardens that I built
we've<00:00:26.820> placed<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.990> along<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> side<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
we've placed them along the side of the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.049 
we've placed them along the side of the
house<00:00:29.789> here<00:00:30.500> between<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.859> driveway<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
house here between the driveway and the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.540 
house here between the driveway and the
side<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> house<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> southern

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
side of the house this is a southern

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.530 
side of the house this is a southern
exposure<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.730> so<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.360> most

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
exposure right here so actually the most

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
exposure right here so actually the most
amount<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.050> sunlight<00:00:40.320> we're<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.890> get

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
amount of sunlight we're going to get

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.540 
amount of sunlight we're going to get
pretty<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.379> on<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.739> side<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> house

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pretty much is on this side of the house

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.209 
pretty much is on this side of the house
so<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> gets<00:00:45.690> pretty<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.230> light<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.860> most<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so it gets pretty good light for most of

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.720 
so it gets pretty good light for most of
the<00:00:47.370> day<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> great<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.219> about<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the day and the great thing about a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
the day and the great thing about a
raised<00:00:51.000> bed<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.579> we<00:00:53.579> can

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
raised bed like this is we can

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.189 
raised bed like this is we can
essentially<00:00:54.120> pick<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> move<00:00:54.930> them

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
essentially pick them up and move them

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.619 
essentially pick them up and move them
around<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.890> need<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.149> quite<00:00:57.480> as

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
around if we need to it's not quite as

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
around if we need to it's not quite as
permanent<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.320> something<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.219> sit

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
permanent as something that would sit

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
permanent as something that would sit
flat<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> ground<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.520> actually<00:01:02.520> tilled

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
flat on the ground or actually tilled

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.740 
flat on the ground or actually tilled
into<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> ground<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> place<00:01:06.510> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
into the ground and so we can place it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
into the ground and so we can place it
on<00:01:06.869> something<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.470> could<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.890> grass<00:01:08.700> could

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
on something that could be grass could

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.420 
on something that could be grass could
be<00:01:10.040> brick<00:01:11.040> patio<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.990> dirt

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
be brick patio or it could just be dirt

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.100 
be brick patio or it could just be dirt
like<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> case<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.979> over<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.090> anyways<00:01:18.450> we

those<00:01:56.610> tanks<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> i<00:01:57.960> figured<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.200 
those tanks and i figured it would be a
great<00:01:59.399> idea<00:01:59.430> to<00:02:00.979> grow<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.219> many<00:02:02.490> vegetables<00:02:02.759> as

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
great idea to grow as many vegetables as

plecos<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.489> year<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.720> I'm<00:02:10.229> hoping

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
plecos all year around so I'm hoping

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.979

scraggly I had them inside a little bit
too<00:02:16.360> long<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.990> can<00:02:17.110> see<00:02:17.320> some<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.800> leaves

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
too long you can see some of the leaves

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.530 
too long you can see some of the leaves
are<00:02:18.460> yellow<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:20.170> they<00:02:20.290> are<00:02:20.440> flowering<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.540> I'm

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
are yellow but they are flowering so I'm

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.900 
are yellow but they are flowering so I'm
hoping<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.320> they<00:02:23.770> will<00:02:23.920> bounce<00:02:24.250> back<00:02:24.460> a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
hoping that they will bounce back a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.880 
hoping that they will bounce back a
little<00:02:25.180> bit<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:25.840> been<00:02:26.050> kind<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.350> cool<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
little bit it's been kind of cool and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.130 
little bit it's been kind of cool and
windy<00:02:27.520> here<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> past<00:02:29.320> few<00:02:30.190> days<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
windy here for the past few days so this

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.890 
windy here for the past few days so this
is<00:02:32.170> their<00:02:32.500> first<00:02:32.530> time<00:02:32.920> outdoors<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.030> I'm

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
is their first time outdoors and I'm

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.870 
is their first time outdoors and I'm
hoping<00:02:35.290> they'll<00:02:35.470> make<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.310> cucumbers

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
hoping they'll make it the cucumbers

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060 
hoping they'll make it the cucumbers
over<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.330> actually<00:02:37.540> look<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.260> best<00:02:38.560> out<00:02:39.010> of

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
over here actually look the best out of

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.360 
over here actually look the best out of
the<00:02:39.430> three<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.320> I'm<00:02:41.320> really<00:02:41.590> hoping<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.100> at

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the three and I'm really hoping that at

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.460 
the three and I'm really hoping that at
least<00:02:42.550> two<00:02:42.820> or<00:02:42.970> three<00:02:43.000> plants<00:02:43.450> are<00:02:44.110> really

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
least two or three plants are really

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.290 
least two or three plants are really
going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.650> take<00:02:44.860> off<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.030> more

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
going to take off and that will be more

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.440 
going to take off and that will be more
than<00:02:46.510> enough<00:02:46.740> for<00:02:47.740> this<00:02:47.950> size<00:02:48.160> bed<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:48.970> anyways

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
than enough for this size bed so anyways

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.810 
than enough for this size bed so anyways
if<00:02:49.690> you're<00:02:50.230> wondering<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.770> how<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.010> constructed

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
if you're wondering on how I constructed

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.710 
if you're wondering on how I constructed
this<00:02:52.030> we've<00:02:52.600> got<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.260> 2<00:02:53.920> by<00:02:54.130> 8<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.030> another

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
this we've got a 2 by 8 here and another

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.040 
this we've got a 2 by 8 here and another
one<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.620> these<00:02:57.370> are<00:02:57.430> four<00:02:57.850> feet<00:02:58.090> long<00:02:58.330> so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
one here and these are four feet long so

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.930 
one here and these are four feet long so
this<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.580> 12<00:03:00.580> x<00:03:00.760> 8<00:03:01.000> x<00:03:01.650> 2<00:03:02.650> x<00:03:02.800> 8<00:03:03.010> by<00:03:03.190> 8<00:03:03.220> foot<00:03:03.640> board

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
this is 12 x 8 x 2 x 8 by 8 foot board

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.470 
this is 12 x 8 x 2 x 8 by 8 foot board
right<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.040> sides<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.239> more

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
right and then on the sides we have more

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.900 
right and then on the sides we have more
of<00:03:07.660> them<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.140> they're<00:03:08.350> cut<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.770> two<00:03:08.980> feet<00:03:09.280> so

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
of them but they're cut to two feet so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.020 
of them but they're cut to two feet so
what<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.239> tried<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:10.959> was<00:03:11.530> simplify<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
what I tried to do was simplify the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.650 
what I tried to do was simplify the
design<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.080> maximize<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
design of this and maximize all of the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.740 
design of this and maximize all of the
wood<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.220> not<00:03:18.220> waste<00:03:18.549> any<00:03:18.850> wood<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> cuts

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
wood and not waste any wood in the cuts

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.789 
wood and not waste any wood in the cuts
so<00:03:20.230> because<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.370> is<00:03:21.580> one<00:03:21.820> full<00:03:22.120> board<00:03:22.799> these

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
so because this is one full board these

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.060 
so because this is one full board these
here<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.510> other<00:03:25.780> side<00:03:26.170> is<00:03:26.470> another

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
here and on the other side is another

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.550 
here and on the other side is another
full<00:03:27.400> board<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.000> then<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.810> back<00:03:29.019> we<00:03:29.530> have

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
full board and then on the back we have

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.060 
full board and then on the back we have
our<00:03:29.890> third<00:03:30.220> full<00:03:30.640> board<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.720> three<00:03:32.500> boards

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
our third full board so three boards

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.270 
our third full board so three boards
total<00:03:33.549> to<00:03:34.269> make<00:03:34.450> up<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.810> side<00:03:35.530> walls<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:36.100> that

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
total to make up the side walls of that

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.440 
total to make up the side walls of that
and<00:03:36.580> then<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.410> our<00:03:38.739> 4<00:03:38.950> by<00:03:39.100> 4<00:03:39.370> posts<00:03:39.820> which

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
and then we have our 4 by 4 posts which

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.500 
and then we have our 4 by 4 posts which
are<00:03:40.600> acting<00:03:41.019> as<00:03:41.230> our<00:03:41.650> legs<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.549> those<00:03:43.090> again

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
are acting as our legs and those again

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.020 
are acting as our legs and those again
are<00:03:43.690> two<00:03:44.500> feet<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:46.480> got<00:03:46.690> another<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.910> know

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
are two feet so we got another you know

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.979 
are two feet so we got another you know
full<00:03:49.360> full<00:03:49.840> board<00:03:50.200> width<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.950> here<00:03:51.989> because

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
full full board width in here because

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.460 
full full board width in here because
each<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:54.160> these<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.700> 8<00:03:55.030> feet<00:03:55.330> as<00:03:55.600> well<00:03:55.840> so

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
each of these is 8 feet as well so

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.500 
each of these is 8 feet as well so
that's<00:03:56.739> 1<00:03:57.420> 4<00:03:58.420> by<00:03:58.600> 4<00:03:58.930> by<00:03:59.080> 8<00:03:59.110> foot<00:03:59.709> board<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.820> then

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
that's 1 4 by 4 by 8 foot board and then

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.840 
that's 1 4 by 4 by 8 foot board and then
down<00:04:01.810> below<00:04:01.840> we<00:04:02.830> simply<00:04:03.070> have<00:04:03.489> some

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
down below we simply have some

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.940 
down below we simply have some
two-by-fours<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.480> those<00:04:04.900> are<00:04:05.110> again<00:04:05.410> cut<00:04:05.739> to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
two-by-fours and those are again cut to

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.449 
two-by-fours and those are again cut to
two<00:04:06.130> feet<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:07.060> very<00:04:07.720> simple<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:09.070> actually

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
two feet so very simple and actually

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.780 
two feet so very simple and actually
down<00:04:09.610> below<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:11.260> have<00:04:11.500> another<00:04:12.070> two<00:04:12.610> by

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
down below it we have another two by

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.610 
down below it we have another two by
four<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.299> that's<00:04:13.480> cut<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.870> 4<00:04:14.110> feet<00:04:14.380> and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
four and that's cut the 4 feet and

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.759 
four and that's cut the 4 feet and
that's<00:04:15.250> kind<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.549> carrying<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.150> load<00:04:16.359> of<00:04:17.320> all

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
that's kind of carrying the load of all

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.980 
that's kind of carrying the load of all
of<00:04:17.919> those<00:04:18.070> slats<00:04:18.489> down<00:04:19.150> below<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:21.340> know

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
of those slats down below so you know

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.040 
of those slats down below so you know
you<00:04:22.990> know<00:04:23.110> not<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.470> expensive<00:04:24.039> on

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
you know not that expensive on

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.649 
you know not that expensive on
lumber<00:04:25.819> I<00:04:26.840> believe<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.990> was<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.729> three<00:04:29.729> two

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
lumber I believe it was like three two

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.210 
lumber I believe it was like three two
by<00:04:30.840> fours<00:04:31.340> underneath<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.870> as<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.740> see<00:04:34.770> I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
by fours underneath and as you can see I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460 
by fours underneath and as you can see I
do<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:35.639> a<00:04:35.669> little<00:04:35.879> bit<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.449> liner<00:04:36.720> in<00:04:37.080> here

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
do have a little bit of a liner in here

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.680 
do have a little bit of a liner in here
that's<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.220> dirt<00:04:38.460> doesn't<00:04:39.210> completely

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
that's just the dirt doesn't completely

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.860 
that's just the dirt doesn't completely
fall<00:04:40.050> out<00:04:40.259> onto<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> ground<00:04:41.099> and<00:04:41.690> if<00:04:42.690> we

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
fall out onto the ground and if we

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.279 
fall out onto the ground and if we
actually<00:04:43.050> look<00:04:43.319> on<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:45.000> sides<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.840> can<00:04:45.870> see

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
actually look on the sides you can see

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.559 
actually look on the sides you can see
there's<00:04:46.560> some<00:04:46.620> poultry<00:04:46.979> netting<00:04:47.389> which<00:04:48.389> has

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
there's some poultry netting which has

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.899 
there's some poultry netting which has
been<00:04:48.750> stapled<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.409> the<00:04:49.470> inside<00:04:49.889> as<00:04:50.099> well<00:04:50.129> so

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
been stapled to the inside as well so

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.230 
been stapled to the inside as well so
that<00:04:50.940> combined<00:04:51.720> with<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.990> plastic<00:04:52.259> liner<00:04:52.740> is

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
that combined with that plastic liner is

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.219 
that combined with that plastic liner is
enough<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.360> keep<00:04:54.539> all<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:55.460> soil<00:04:56.460> in<00:04:56.970> place

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
enough to keep all of that soil in place

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.800 
enough to keep all of that soil in place
so<00:04:58.229> anyways<00:04:58.770> guys<00:04:59.069> those<00:05:00.000> are<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.240> raised<00:05:00.479> bed

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
so anyways guys those are the raised bed

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.050 
so anyways guys those are the raised bed
gardens<00:05:01.379> they<00:05:01.830> might<00:05:02.069> not<00:05:02.250> live<00:05:02.610> here<00:05:02.909> forever

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
gardens they might not live here forever

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.510 
gardens they might not live here forever
but<00:05:03.780> for<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.080> season<00:05:04.530> this<00:05:05.159> is<00:05:05.340> where

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
but for this season this is where

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.430 
but for this season this is where
they're<00:05:05.669> going<00:05:05.849> to<00:05:05.909> go<00:05:06.090> I'm<00:05:06.569> assuming<00:05:07.169> if<00:05:07.289> they

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
they're going to go I'm assuming if they

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.980 
they're going to go I'm assuming if they
do<00:05:07.500> take<00:05:07.860> off<00:05:08.099> and<00:05:08.400> they're<00:05:09.030> viney<00:05:09.360> plants

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
do take off and they're viney plants

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.230 
do take off and they're viney plants
that<00:05:10.379> this<00:05:10.560> whole<00:05:10.740> area<00:05:11.219> might<00:05:11.909> just<00:05:12.120> be

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
that this whole area might just be

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.240 
that this whole area might just be
covered<00:05:12.629> with<00:05:13.400> vines<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:15.860> vegetables<00:05:16.860> at

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
covered with vines and vegetables at

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.059 
covered with vines and vegetables at
least<00:05:17.520> one<00:05:18.000> can<00:05:18.180> hope<00:05:18.449> so<00:05:19.110> that's<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.830> plan

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
least one can hope so that's the plan

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.999
