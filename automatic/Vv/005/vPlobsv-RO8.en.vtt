00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.430 
to jailbreak okay so back in taiji just
go<00:04:25.720> ahead<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.930> click<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.260> big<00:04:26.710> blue<00:04:27.070> eye

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
go ahead and click that big blue eye

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.140 
go ahead and click that big blue eye
on<00:04:27.560> even<00:04:27.770> though<00:04:27.980> it's<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.220> Chinese<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:29.030> know

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
on even though it's in Chinese you know

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.060 
on even though it's in Chinese you know
it's<00:04:29.360> still<00:04:29.600> okay<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.650> jailbreak

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
it's still okay and the jailbreak

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.970 
it's still okay and the jailbreak
process<00:04:31.220> will<00:04:31.730> begin<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.870> really<00:04:33.440> hope<00:04:33.710> that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
process will begin so I really hope that

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.490 
process will begin so I really hope that
this<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.520> no<00:04:34.670> way<00:04:34.700> removes<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.870> possibility

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
this in no way removes the possibility

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.140 
this in no way removes the possibility
of<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.650> jailbreak<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.280> future<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.910> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
of a jailbreak in the future for the

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.600 
of a jailbreak in the future for the
public<00:04:38.510> release<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.960> 8.2<00:04:39.380> I<00:04:39.500> didn't<00:04:39.890> really<00:04:40.100> do

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
public release of 8.2 I didn't really do

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.340 
public release of 8.2 I didn't really do
any<00:04:40.760> research<00:04:41.000> into<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.630> but<00:04:41.810> i<00:04:41.840> really<00:04:42.170> hope

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
any research into that but i really hope

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.170 
any research into that but i really hope
jailbreak<00:04:42.890> is<00:04:43.040> available<00:04:43.520> for<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.790> final

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
jailbreak is available for the final

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.030 
jailbreak is available for the final
public<00:04:44.540> release<00:04:44.840> otherwise<00:04:45.380> this<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.740> a<00:04:45.770> nice

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
public release otherwise this is a nice

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.890 
public release otherwise this is a nice
way<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.280> enjoy<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> jailbreak<00:04:47.090> if<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.720> have

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
way to enjoy a jailbreak if you have

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.870 
way to enjoy a jailbreak if you have
updated<00:04:48.290> eight<00:04:48.560> point<00:04:48.800> one<00:04:48.890> point<00:04:49.010> three<00:04:49.280> once

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
updated eight point one point three once

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.120 
updated eight point one point three once
this<00:04:50.030> does<00:04:50.270> complete<00:04:50.720> hopefully<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.650> do<00:04:51.800> have

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
this does complete hopefully I do have

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.090 
this does complete hopefully I do have
Cydia<00:04:52.520> running<00:04:53.030> on<00:04:53.180> my<00:04:53.390> iOS<00:04:53.600> 8.2<00:04:54.380> firmware<00:04:54.830> now

about<00:04:56.690> is<00:04:56.960> do<00:04:57.590> not<00:04:57.770> update<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> newer

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
about is do not update to a newer

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.210 
about is do not update to a newer
version<00:04:58.700> of<00:04:59.150> 8.2<00:04:59.600> because<00:05:00.380> this<00:05:00.620> only<00:05:00.890> works

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
version of 8.2 because this only works

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.400 
version of 8.2 because this only works
on<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.700> first<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:02.210> second<00:05:02.600> betas<00:05:02.960> if<00:05:03.140> you<00:05:03.260> do

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
on the first and second betas if you do

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.740 
on the first and second betas if you do
update<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.980> jailbreak<00:05:04.640> will<00:05:04.850> no<00:05:05.030> longer<00:05:05.060> be

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
update a jailbreak will no longer be

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.300 
update a jailbreak will no longer be
possible<00:05:05.990> you'll<00:05:06.470> have<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.800> repeat<00:05:06.950> this

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
possible you'll have to repeat this

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.120 
possible you'll have to repeat this
entire<00:05:07.670> process<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.720> once<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.230> is<00:05:09.410> done<00:05:09.440> I'll

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
entire process so once this is done I'll

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.790 
entire process so once this is done I'll
be<00:05:10.430> right<00:05:10.880> back<00:05:11.060> alright<00:05:11.660> so<00:05:11.990> my<00:05:12.140> device<00:05:12.410> has

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
be right back alright so my device has

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.550 
be right back alright so my device has
restarted<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.910> let's<00:05:14.510> hope<00:05:14.810> city<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.290> there

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
restarted and let's hope city is there

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.730 
restarted and let's hope city is there
cool<00:05:16.280> so<00:05:16.670> cydia<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.360> enabled<00:05:17.840> so<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.620> go

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
cool so cydia is enabled so you can go

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.100 
cool so cydia is enabled so you can go

to Wi-Fi of course and open up cydia so

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.090 
to Wi-Fi of course and open up cydia so
in<00:05:26.930> here<00:05:27.170> it's<00:05:27.350> going<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.560> prepare<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:27.950> file

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
in here it's going to prepare the file

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.590 
in here it's going to prepare the file
systems<00:05:28.520> this<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:28.850> going<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.030> take<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.240> few

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
systems this is going to take a few

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.880 
systems this is going to take a few
minutes<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.140> know<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.320> prepare<00:05:30.530> everything

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
minutes you know to prepare everything

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.190 
minutes you know to prepare everything
initially<00:05:31.460> once<00:05:32.090> that's<00:05:32.300> done<00:05:32.480> i'll<00:05:32.540> be<00:05:32.840> right

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
initially once that's done i'll be right

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.050 
initially once that's done i'll be right
back<00:05:33.380> alright<00:05:33.890> so<00:05:34.070> my<00:05:34.220> advice<00:05:34.280> has<00:05:34.700> just

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
back alright so my advice has just

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.909 
back alright so my advice has just
restrung<00:05:35.480> and<00:05:35.750> now<00:05:36.169> when<00:05:36.320> i<00:05:36.350> open<00:05:36.680> up<00:05:36.740> cydia

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
restrung and now when i open up cydia

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.010 
restrung and now when i open up cydia
it's<00:05:37.430> already<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.300> there's<00:05:38.450> not<00:05:38.750> going<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:38.960> be

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
it's already so there's not going to be

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.540 
it's already so there's not going to be
anything<00:05:39.350> in<00:05:39.590> here<00:05:39.620> until<00:05:39.980> you<00:05:40.070> go<00:05:40.220> into<00:05:40.250> the
