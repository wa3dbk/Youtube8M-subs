00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
seem cohesive at the beginning but you

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.280 
seem cohesive at the beginning but you
could<00:05:11.710> see<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.160> improve<00:05:13.030> like<00:05:13.600> after<00:05:14.050> episode

incredible character and then Yoko I

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.890 
incredible character and then Yoko I
mean<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.730> first<00:05:59.940> two<00:06:00.120> episodes<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.720> thought

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
mean the first two episodes I thought

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.330 
mean the first two episodes I thought
she<00:06:01.110> well<00:06:01.500> she<00:06:01.530> didn't<00:06:02.010> really<00:06:02.130> have<00:06:02.310> a

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
she well she didn't really have a

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.220 
she well she didn't really have a
personality<00:06:02.730> she<00:06:03.150> was<00:06:03.270> just<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.720> set<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:04.020> boobs

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
personality she was just a set of boobs

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.040 
personality she was just a set of boobs
but<00:06:05.040> I<00:06:05.310> think<00:06:05.730> in<00:06:05.880> this<00:06:06.090> episode<00:06:06.390> we<00:06:06.720> could<00:06:06.870> see

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
but I think in this episode we could see

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.560 
but I think in this episode we could see
more<00:06:07.260> of<00:06:07.380> her<00:06:07.500> personality<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:08.250> she<00:06:08.820> she's

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
more of her personality and she she's

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.300 
more of her personality and she she's
gonna<00:06:10.260> be<00:06:10.500> able<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.740> stand<00:06:10.950> on<00:06:11.160> her<00:06:11.280> own
