00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.840 
here i just have that math association
open<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.650> i'm<00:04:29.800> just<00:04:29.830> going<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.190> zoom<00:04:30.640> out<00:04:30.790> a

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
open so i'm just going to zoom out a

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.820 
open so i'm just going to zoom out a
little<00:04:30.970> bit<00:04:31.270> at<00:04:31.390> work<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:32.200> then<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.530> can<00:04:32.710> kind

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
little bit at work and then you can kind

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.340 
little bit at work and then you can kind
of<00:04:32.980> see<00:04:33.040> how<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.730> is<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.120> does<00:04:34.570> really<00:04:34.900> give<00:04:35.320> you

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
of see how it is it does really give you

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.560 
of see how it is it does really give you
a<00:04:35.470> full<00:04:35.710> turn<00:04:35.860> by<00:04:36.070> turn<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.580> also<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.330> got<00:04:37.540> a

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
a full turn by turn and also it's got a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.870 
a full turn by turn and also it's got a
very<00:04:37.810> beautiful<00:04:38.080> light<00:04:38.500> sensor<00:04:39.070> which<00:04:39.580> means

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
very beautiful light sensor which means

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.180 
very beautiful light sensor which means
