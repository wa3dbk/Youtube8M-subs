00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 do not forget to check the description 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
 of the video for more information 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.770
 I was all world I am a reef cyan cannabis 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.690
 the hell with mexico with the video of 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.380
 universe and the location of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.950
 dolls gdr the first one is on this map 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.570
 called paul kenyon 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 English and recognize the gbr friends 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.690
 I do not know if they remember that there was a rumor 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 that there was going to be a new helmet 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.790
 precisely these dolls have that 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.620
 new helmet the location is they get by 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.160
 some of the transporters and there 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.700
 they reach this point where they shoot at 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.400
 doll that is located on the rock then 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.110
 we go to the high noon map here we go to 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.090
 this part of the map will recognize it 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.070
 because there is this giant column up 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.170
 here, as you can see, is the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.170
 doll you shoot him and he's falling like that 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.900
 and we are already walking towards 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.580
 flying in this case I have jet paq and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.440
 we have the doll here very good and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.320
 meike this from jaime loved me about 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 all because hagen was the best map of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.470
 halo 1 good was my favorite map then 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.180
 we went to the other map this that I do not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.760
 agreement I know how it's called like that something like that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.010
 like mountain range if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.750
 point is that it is the remake of timberland 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.270
 here what I actually started the game and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.610
 this to guide them where the others 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 two are not that hard to find 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.860
 they are quite visible but this is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 hidden inside a box is in the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 red base as you can see there this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.320
 appears and in this box I remembered that it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.560
 I found the doll gdr this fits 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.150
 note that these are only 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 district if it does not really give you the new 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.979
 helmet or anything like that and I really do not know 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 how you get that if it's just 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.630
 exclusive studio or something 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.240
 I'm very sure but there is the doll 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.759
 gdr inside that red base box 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 remember then we go to the other map to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.050
 remake of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.730
 I'm bad at remembering names when 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.530
 I'm tired, the point is that there 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.530
 there is the waterfall and there are those three 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.200
 blue points for reference let's what 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 that are gadgets for gadgets I said 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.350
 gadgets for some cannons men there 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.570
 we have the man cannon here in 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.930
 the wall in this little cavity there is 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.510
 see how the doll comes out and let's go 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.290
 we approach there we have the cute little doll 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.020
 gpr I love to crush them later in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.840
 solitary map we are in this room 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.840
 on the second floor where you see that there 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.550
 tubes inside a room that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.400
 it makes me accessible and we're going to do it 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.560
 accessible let's put you 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.970
 transporters but remember to put them 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.209
 in normal physics because here in phase 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.380
 they do not work then put the physics 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.250
 normal 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.870
 so there are no problems that was 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 my sorry mistake gave me a little bit of 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.220
 hiccup and here was also my mistake to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.740
 put the non-recipient in phase 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.020
 and not normal then there you can see that 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.510
 he tried to enter and they really give us 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.340
 results but they can put you 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.250
 transporters and that was his mistake 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.680
 can another teleporter in there 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.460
 this pretty fast they change it to normal 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 there we have let it fall and we 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.230
 we put the teleporter in this 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.630
 this side of the room in a corner 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.350
 sad is the doll gdr 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.170
 forever alone 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.200
 then to the shooting map we jump in 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.680
 this small tree that is here that is the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.630
 pure trunk with dry branches this is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.170
 easy to locate is right next to the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.630
 base we walk to the tip of this 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.080
 branch there is no there is no other problem here to 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.120
 not to be shot like there and here 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.770
 it seems to me a little bit of the flight because 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.660
 you have to fly so high so you do not 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.950
 the message appears so fast without 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.080
 But once you get to the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.329
 rocks is going to start giving you the message 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.159
 but there is the gdr doll 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.739
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:23.710
 video that has been useful for these 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.069
 little sister ex who discover them by 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.750
 fun is not up here have 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.240
 made for more yale university videos 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.650
 that I will be going up very soon 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
 thank you very much everyone for watching and 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.960
 remember I am yale or more and until the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.960
