00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.849
 hi cube guys is cover once 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.500
 more we have a review and a boxing 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.960
 a cube that many people had 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.900
 been waiting because because he is 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.599
 quilombo highlighted a new cube now in 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.250
 5 x 5 this time we have it on base 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.949
 black from our friend vÃ­ctor ortiz 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.489
 national mega mix champion and also 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.850
 a good competitor in 5 by 5 is going to 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.390
 do the unboxing of this cube as 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.699
 you see it 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.500
 Victor, how do you think this one comes out 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.059
 before I believed that the cubes were 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.940
 difficult but I saw that opening them is more 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.750
 well here is the box as everything 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 cube I'm going to work this this cube is 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.629
 very well our customer that the mobile 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.269
 they are excellent topics is similar to an 8 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.890
 andy for so compare well in 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.170
 first impressions with an out when 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.140
 8 I do not quite know then is 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.470
 very good this then good we 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.660
 comment that this cube is 5 x 5 goes to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.270
 have a price similar to zinc 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.980
 Mobility show that you think is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.810
 better than zinc 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.790
 not the truth is that it is much better than 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.920
 fact I think it's almost 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.360
 compared to the lounge and almost to the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.820
 half the price would be half of 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.520
 pressure what I did not like is that it 's 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.260
 little bit bigger than 8 told us 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.470
 is that it could also be possible that 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.990
 this game had a few options 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.970
 block at some point or you believe and not 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.160
 possible as well as all the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.430
 toys are blocked because many 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.620
 inexperienced young people want to do it 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.110
 cutting 45 degrees that he can not 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.390
 Cutting from a line is what you should 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.170
 buy a 5 for 5 in 4x4 all everything 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.360
 they do until the re seen done but it 's 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 in short this is very good them 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.530
 would you recommend for a professional or for 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.150
 a beginner for an intermediate 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.700
 because for beginners it is very good 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.300
 to start 5 for 5 the same for a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.360
 product arrived that you are already using a 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.820
 warfare right now that you're moving 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.470
 same power to return it to see how 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.680
 that has mixed 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 and that while they talk to us, you think your 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.520
 that you're moving it, I think I was 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.050
 a little unstable but I can be 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.300
 possible in this how do you think a 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.640
 beginner can move it and make it 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 by itself already depending on the 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:42.030
 tensions are not even very well the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 true if from 4x4 origin work 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.600
 then on the rise you have to find 6 5 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 for 5 with 6 sow 5 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.530
 cyclone cycle very good well as such 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.840
 he did it guys google again 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.820
 skubic is not an opinion any of 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.190
 be a national mega mix champion 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.110
 It is also very good in 5 by 5 if 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.300
 we leave at your discretion come and review it 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.340
