00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.160 
juices out I learned up on a cooking
show<00:01:24.960> okay<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.090> squeezed<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.900> into

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

the bottle and I also added like four
times<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.650> four<00:01:31.920> times<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.490> water

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
times about four times this much water

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
times about four times this much water
and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> tiny<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.200> olive<00:01:34.320> oil

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and then just a tiny bit of olive oil

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
and then just a tiny bit of olive oil
you<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.009> too<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.280> um<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.360> then<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
you don't want too much um and then I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
you don't want too much um and then I
went<00:01:36.869> outside<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> Sun<00:01:37.920> put<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.820> sunscreen

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
went outside in the Sun put on sunscreen
and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.170> shook<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> bottle<00:01:40.950> because

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and then I shook up the bottle because

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
and then I shook up the bottle because
the<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.790> need<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.030> mix<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.570> water<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the you need to mix the water and the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
the you need to mix the water and the
oil<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.740> much<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> possible<00:01:44.159> you're<00:01:44.850> gonna

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

have to keep shaking it too because

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.399 
have to keep shaking it too because
they'll<00:01:46.890> separate<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.670> fast<00:01:47.970> um<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:49.140> I
