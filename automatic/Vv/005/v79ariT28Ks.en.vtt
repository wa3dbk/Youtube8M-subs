but<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.569> really<00:03:02.050> just<00:03:02.080> playing<00:03:02.530> with

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680

the<00:03:02.800> wig<00:03:02.980> fluffing<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.519> wig<00:03:03.760> out<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.300> think

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the wig fluffing the wig out I think

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.009 
the wig fluffing the wig out I think
once<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:06.030> brush<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.239> with<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> loop<00:03:07.720> brush

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
once you brush it with the loop brush

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.830 
once you brush it with the loop brush
have<00:03:08.620> your<00:03:08.830> fingers<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.430> let<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.209> natural

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
have your fingers in it let the natural

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.840 
have your fingers in it let the natural
oils<00:03:11.440> from<00:03:11.530> your<00:03:11.739> fingers<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.580> run

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
oils from your fingers really run

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.910 
oils from your fingers really run
through<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.870> hair<00:03:14.080> really<00:03:14.440> starts<00:03:14.830> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
through it the hair really starts to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.100 
through it the hair really starts to
take<00:03:15.100> shape

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
take shape

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.090 
take shape
because<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.350> said<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.680> looks<00:03:17.860> very

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
because like I said it looks very

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.630 
because like I said it looks very
noodley<00:03:18.670> very<00:03:19.450> dull<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:21.090> very<00:03:22.090> blond<00:03:22.900> pasta

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
noodley very dull like very blond pasta

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.830 
noodley very dull like very blond pasta
but<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.790> know<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:25.030> I'm<00:03:25.180> playing<00:03:25.390> with<00:03:25.660> them

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
but you know as I'm playing with them

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.300 
but you know as I'm playing with them
more<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.049> am<00:03:26.440> liking<00:03:26.920> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
more I am liking it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.820 
more I am liking it
I<00:03:27.340> typically<00:03:28.330> probably<00:03:29.290> couldn't<00:03:29.620> do<00:03:29.799> like

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
I typically probably couldn't do like

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.940 
I typically probably couldn't do like
this<00:03:30.220> cooler<00:03:30.580> blonde<00:03:31.150> tone<00:03:31.540> without<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.739> root

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
this cooler blonde tone without the root

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.890 
this cooler blonde tone without the root
having<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.519> dark<00:03:33.790> root<00:03:34.030> really<00:03:34.480> makes<00:03:34.720> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
having a dark root really makes a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.270 
having a dark root really makes a
difference

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
difference

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.300 
difference

kind of press it and it's got that weird

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.199 
kind of press it and it's got that weird
perforation<00:03:51.040> at<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.370> top<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.760> doesn't<00:03:51.940> have

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
perforation at the top it doesn't have

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.420 
perforation at the top it doesn't have
that<00:03:52.510> if<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.260> kind<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.560> wanted<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.920> pull<00:03:54.220> off

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
that if I kind of wanted to pull off

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.360 
that if I kind of wanted to pull off
like<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.670> black<00:03:55.060> Marilyn<00:03:55.989> Monroe<00:03:56.440> or<00:03:56.769> old<00:03:57.040> type

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
like a black Marilyn Monroe or old type

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.140 
like a black Marilyn Monroe or old type
you<00:03:58.150> know<00:03:58.269> look<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.380> would<00:04:00.010> be<00:04:00.040> able<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.519> do<00:04:00.790> it

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.539 
you know look I would be able to do it
I<00:04:01.180> think<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.930> deep<00:04:02.230> cut<00:04:02.560> crease<00:04:02.890> works<00:04:03.220> very

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
I think the deep cut crease works very

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.860 
I think the deep cut crease works very
very<00:04:03.670> well<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:05.519> could<00:04:06.519> really<00:04:06.819> see<00:04:07.120> myself<00:04:07.150> you

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.710 
very well I could really see myself you
know<00:04:07.989> making<00:04:08.590> quite<00:04:08.980> an<00:04:09.359> impression<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.660> a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
know making quite an impression and a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.620 
know making quite an impression and a
good<00:04:10.900> picture<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:12.160> probably<00:04:12.670> should<00:04:13.180> have<00:04:13.209> put

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
good picture I probably should have put

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.770 
good picture I probably should have put
on<00:04:13.690> some<00:04:14.100> red<00:04:15.100> lipstick<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.940> really<00:04:16.570> really

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
on some red lipstick to really really

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.050 
on some red lipstick to really really
really<00:04:16.870> make<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.500> pop<00:04:17.769> and<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.400> think<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.789> did<00:04:19.030> I

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
really make this pop and I think I did I

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.940 
really make this pop and I think I did I
think<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.419> ended<00:04:19.630> up<00:04:19.720> putting<00:04:19.959> on<00:04:20.200> red<00:04:20.440> lipstick

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
think I ended up putting on red lipstick

said is this Philly's jam approved yes I

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.050 
said is this Philly's jam approved yes I
think<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.140> density<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.710> great<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.280> think<00:05:02.580> once

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
think the density is great I think once

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.100 
think the density is great I think once
you<00:05:03.150> comb<00:05:03.480> through<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:04.200> is<00:05:06.020> fantastic<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
you comb through it it is fantastic and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.900 
you comb through it it is fantastic and
it<00:05:07.260> starts<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.710> shape<00:05:07.980> take<00:05:08.370> shape<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.790> little

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
it starts to shape take shape a little

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.200 
it starts to shape take shape a little
bit<00:05:09.060> better<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:10.440> think<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.310> should<00:05:11.580> definitely

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
bit better I think you should definitely

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.240 
bit better I think you should definitely
try<00:05:12.390> this<00:05:12.480> wiggle<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> caution<00:05:13.650> because<00:05:13.800> it's<00:05:14.130> a

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
try this wiggle a caution because it's a

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.570 
try this wiggle a caution because it's a
very<00:05:14.580> very<00:05:15.030> very<00:05:15.150> light<00:05:16.110> blonde<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:17.310> root

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
very very very light blonde the root

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.760 
very very very light blonde the root
does<00:05:18.000> help<00:05:18.390> make<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.080> little<00:05:19.290> bit<00:05:19.500> more

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
does help make it a little bit more

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.450 
does help make it a little bit more
wearable<00:05:20.510> but<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.990> think<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.650> price<00:05:22.920> point<00:05:23.280> on
