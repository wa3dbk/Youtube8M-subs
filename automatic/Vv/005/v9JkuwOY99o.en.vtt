00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.139
 candy candy candy candy candy candy 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.440
 candy candy candy candy candy candy 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.810
 candy 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.700
 yes there you will get excited about experiments 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.410
 do with candy from left to right 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.079
 are this time lapse 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.630
 Steven Goudswaard Hannah of the 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.470
 and linear gradient from alblasserdam they 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.749
 together form the 2015 taste panel kit 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.939
 you get all of that for me a few 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.290
 cotton buds that are the first test 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.790
 you have everything to do with you 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.830
 taste buds 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.390
 henrike from the kit editorial explains what 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.230
 the children are going to discover from you 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.780
 tongue 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 here is another taste corner you print 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.970
 than here 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 and then others taste completely 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.660
 it is there at the back of your tongue 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.880
 clearly disagree 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.320
 young slut had a hole in school oh yes 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.540
 yes wiser 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.750
 but in the end it was proven by nonsense 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.060
 and where he is absolutely right 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.530
 although their many biology books state that 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.870
 you with the different parts of you 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.449
 tongue tastes different tastes it is one 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.030
 being a myth on your tongue 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.280
 taste buds everywhere and the proven each 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.050
 all tastes that exist 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 do the taste panel test once 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.260
 after 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 with a cotton swab in the glass 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:27.569
 baptize and taste only four glasses with 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.310
 other content well that is fine with 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.860
 those taste buds of today 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.860
 your tongue tastes the same in all places 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.509
 host equally it is not intended that 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.509
 put your paper on there is enough candy 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.460
 nice anyway can that again 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 the taste panel is doing well 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.510
 get harder at the following 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.220
 test you may not see and 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.630
 must keep his nose shut 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.610
 no no we go once more those who 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.560
 not have a blindfold on 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.420
 who can put a candy on the tongue of the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.660
 put another and guess what else 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 it is but now the first time you can 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:21.560
 do you well you have your nose shut price 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.390
 does not taste on you but the kind of village 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.450
 mentioning that is very difficult with your nose 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.360
 close i would do this to me with your nose 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.100
 you ca n't taste close 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.100
 Well talking is pretty difficult 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.350
 it becomes more and more colorful on the table and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
 kids panel is all about tests with me 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.190
 do nothing and then you are all allowed 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.290
 choose a color 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 the panel listens carefully to the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.519
 explanation on each saucer must be one 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.150
 handful of eminems of the same color 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.150
 be laid 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.900
 the panel members pour a little water 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.990
 at the eminem's 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.220
 and now they must stir slowly 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.220
 colorant in the water 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:22.130
 kings by the 4 researchers are now baptizing 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.130
 a filter bag in the colored water 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:30.930
 oh man i see enough very sweet house 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 has brown eminems 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 all sorts of things appear on his filter bag 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 colors are now in the rainbow 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.670
 no the andrea where that score would be 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.599
 almost forgot that and my him they are 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.510
 to eat 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.700
 we go to the next tests 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.569
 water lower than you should 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.580
 ensure that the and the panel members throw you 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.580
 all two eminems in a glass of water 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.700
 that is a precision job because the eminem 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.019
 must be up with the m 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.870
 you taste it with the eminem they put in it 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.769
 water must stand for seven minutes 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.450
 not really 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:15.329
 meanwhile the panel can continue with 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.459
 chips chips is made from potato 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.310
 but of which even more it almost tastes 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.280
 go test how much is in regular chips and 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.780
 in light chips this is shift with whole 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.390
 lots of pvv 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.130
 and this is chips with very little fat in it 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.130
 Well just see if that is really the case 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.200
 when the chips types are in a glass 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.750
 done and carefully gives hannah there 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.970
 boiling water over it 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.090
 we leave it for a while and now see how 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.080
 our m stands for the seven minutes 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.919
 are over and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.919
 is here is the result 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.979
 so the and of the eminem and this that is 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.490
 an edible ink and put them up 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.490
 driven 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.610
 the taste with the chips is not 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.229
 the chips have gone completely well 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.870
 dissolved in the water 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.599
 yes my real sciences fail 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.460
 sometimes you would taste it normally 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.220
 floating on the water 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.800
 then another experiment has it 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.139
 taste panel 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.009
 you taste a sweet and sour drink 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.009
 also with your nose closed 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:36.849
 a school of liberals such as alcohol 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.849
 that's sweet 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.539
 this is bitter 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.740
 sees another side of post lydia 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.090
 it doesn't really sit you but you lydia you 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.889
 really does not taste the other from the 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.419
 just have your cup to drink 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.860
 keep shut 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.860
 you go very brave libya 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.270
 it is also cool if you keep your nose closed 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.800
 it seems less sweet to the taste panel 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.680
 taste a little while and in the meantime 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.130
 we put anything in one row you 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.950
 nose helps you taste flavors 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.760
 your tongue only tastes salty sweet and sour 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.830
 bitter and sharp or savory flavors 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.690
 all other flavors form together 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.820
 with your nose 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.170
 hence your food is also tasteless like 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.810
 you have a cold 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.040
 well seen and heard the panel 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.870
 candy on 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.390
 and meanwhile you can be real 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.870
 investigations get started at home 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.870
 go for it
