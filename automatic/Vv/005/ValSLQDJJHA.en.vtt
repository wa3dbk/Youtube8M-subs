the drop off this guy and he's a lot
tougher<00:01:43.890> than<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.729> but<00:01:45.000> there's

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
tougher than the first one but there's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.010 
tougher than the first one but there's
also<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.780> third<00:01:46.079> assassin<00:01:46.590> too<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.640> know

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
also a third assassin too but you know

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
also a third assassin too but you know
the<00:01:49.020> third<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> pretty<00:01:50.220> decent

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the third one is like a pretty decent

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.690 
the third one is like a pretty decent
ways<00:01:50.939> from<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.619> opinion<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.250> would

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ways from here so in my opinion I would

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.359 
ways from here so in my opinion I would
say<00:01:54.240> fight<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.740> second<00:01:56.250> guy

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
say fight in the first and second guy

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
say fight in the first and second guy
because<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.119> close<00:01:57.390> together<00:01:57.600> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
because they're so close together but
