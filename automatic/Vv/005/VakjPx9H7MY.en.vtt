now it's basically a CD image it is not

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
now it's basically a CD image it is not
a<00:00:21.420> massive<00:00:21.840> download<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.039> hundred<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a massive download it's a hundred and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
a massive download it's a hundred and
ten<00:00:23.580> kilobytes<00:00:24.029> now<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.480> burn<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.840> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
ten kilobytes now when you burn that to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.810 
ten kilobytes now when you burn that to
disk<00:00:25.230> I'll<00:00:25.680> pretty<00:00:25.949> much<00:00:26.070> show<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.369> how<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
disk I'll pretty much show you how it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.179 
disk I'll pretty much show you how it
works<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.529> ahead<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> create<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
works so I'm gonna go ahead and create a

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.890 
works so I'm gonna go ahead and create a
password<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.970> account<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
password for my account on here this is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.479 
password for my account on here this is
Windows<00:00:31.170> XP<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> believe<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> works<00:00:32.250> for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Windows XP but I believe it works for

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
Windows XP but I believe it works for
Windows<00:00:32.700> Vista<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.030> 7<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.620> to
