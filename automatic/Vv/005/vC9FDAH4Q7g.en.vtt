00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
trying to debunk it he wasn't really

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.270 
trying to debunk it he wasn't really
trying<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> debunk<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> he<00:02:28.830> was<00:02:28.920> trying<00:02:29.190> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
trying to debunk it he was trying to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.509 
trying to debunk it he was trying to
explain<00:02:29.519> why<00:02:30.410> but<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> wish<00:02:31.650> he<00:02:31.799> would<00:02:31.950> went

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
explain why but I wish he would went

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.030 
explain why but I wish he would went
ahead<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.239> explain<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.440> people<00:02:34.560> why

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
ahead and then explain to the people why

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.180 
ahead and then explain to the people why
it<00:02:35.100> turns<00:02:35.700> black<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.480> number<00:02:37.170> two<00:02:37.380> most

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
it turns black and number two most

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
it turns black and number two most
importantly<00:02:38.760> why<00:02:39.060> does<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.450> smell<00:02:39.600> like

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
importantly why does it smell like

00:02:40.170 --> 00:03:05.270 
importantly why does it smell like
plastic<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.250> go<00:03:03.350> now<00:03:04.350> my<00:03:04.530> question<00:03:04.590> is

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
plastic here we go now my question is

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.759 
plastic here we go now my question is
why<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.060> media<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.840> concerned<00:03:07.500> about

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
why is the media so concerned about

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.789 
why is the media so concerned about
explaining<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.150> public<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:10.530> like

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
explaining it to the public it's like

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.039 
explaining it to the public it's like
they're<00:03:11.010> afraid<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.700> public<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.840> the

they're afraid the public is on to the

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.650 
they're afraid the public is on to the
fact<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.650> chemtrails<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660

the<00:03:19.829> snow<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.609> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.790> air<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:22.109> they're

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the snow and in the air is so they're

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.090 
the snow and in the air is so they're
afraid<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.790> thing<00:03:23.819> might<00:03:24.390> get<00:03:24.690> exposed<00:03:25.290> so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
afraid this thing might get exposed so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.890 
afraid this thing might get exposed so

little explanation didn't get it all the

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.740 
little explanation didn't get it all the
way<00:03:58.079> what<00:03:58.290> about<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.680> burnt<00:03:58.920> plastic

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.530 

science<00:04:02.260> project<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.790> can<00:04:03.940> all<00:04:04.030> be<00:04:04.240> explained

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
science project it can all be explained

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.300 
science project it can all be explained
by<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> simple<00:04:05.260> scientific<00:04:05.590> principle<00:04:06.280> called

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
by a simple scientific principle called

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.390 
by a simple scientific principle called
sublimation<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.560> means<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.950> snow<00:04:09.190> is

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
sublimation and that means the snow is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.570 
sublimation and that means the snow is
so<00:04:09.760> dry<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.630> is<00:04:10.750> almost<00:04:11.110> no<00:04:11.560> water<00:04:11.920> in<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
so dry it is almost no water in it that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.150 
so dry it is almost no water in it that
means<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:13.090> won't<00:04:13.300> really<00:04:13.660> melt<00:04:13.990> when<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.950> put

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
means it won't really melt when you put

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.500 
means it won't really melt when you put
a<00:04:15.190> plane<00:04:15.550> to<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:16.000> because<00:04:16.390> it's<00:04:16.720> mostly<00:04:17.650> air

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
a plane to it because it's mostly air

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.590 
a plane to it because it's mostly air
okay<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.570> got<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.340> got<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.790> got<00:04:21.850> it

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
okay you got that got it I got it

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.990 
okay you got that got it I got it
what
