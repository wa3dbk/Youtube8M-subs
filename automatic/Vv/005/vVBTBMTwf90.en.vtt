I'm definitely gonna do a video on how
to<00:00:30.390> build<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> computer<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:33.290> some<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to build a computer and some of the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.870 
to build a computer and some of the
place<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.890> got<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> right

place that you got I'm gonna go to right
now<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:38.579> motor<00:00:39.239> body<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.600> using<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
now so and the motor body is using is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
now so and the motor body is using is
the<00:00:41.809> sabertooth<00:00:42.809> 990fx<00:00:44.030> nice<00:00:45.030> water<00:00:45.300> board

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
the sabertooth 990fx nice water board

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.220 
the sabertooth 990fx nice water board
that's<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.079> used<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:48.079> for<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
that's going to be used for for the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
that's going to be used for for the
Conqueror<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.980> having<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.940> computer<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
Conqueror is having and the computer is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
Conqueror is having and the computer is
going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.170> based<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:56.930> on<00:00:57.949> room<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
going to be based on on room for

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to be based on on room for
expansion<00:00:59.670> later<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.719> that's<00:01:01.410> why<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.620> went

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
expansion later on that's why we went

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.260 
expansion later on that's why we went
with<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> saber-tooth<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> supports

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
with the saber-tooth because it supports

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.370 
with the saber-tooth because it supports
am3+<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:04.860> support<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> bulldozer

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
am3+ which will support the bulldozer

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.890 
am3+ which will support the bulldozer
let's<00:01:07.650> come<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:07.979> soon<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.360> expand

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
let's come out soon so you can expand

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.270 
let's come out soon so you can expand
that<00:01:10.049> boot<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.740> he's<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> be

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that boot right now he's going to be

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.730 
that boot right now he's going to be

thing I like to do when I put the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.400 
thing I like to do when I put the
computer<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:28.160> get<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> kids<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.410> put

in<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> power<00:02:31.829> supply<00:02:32.090> first<00:02:33.090> why<00:02:33.360> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
in the power supply first why is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.300 
in the power supply first why is
probably<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> easiest<00:02:33.989> thing<00:02:34.769> to<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.160> doing

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
probably the easiest thing to be doing

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150 
probably the easiest thing to be doing
when<00:02:36.239> building<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.750> computer<00:02:37.049> it's<00:02:38.040> very

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
when building the computer it's very

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.559 
when building the computer it's very
much<00:02:38.370> four<00:02:38.579> screws<00:02:38.910> holding<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.269> in<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.390> back

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
much four screws holding it in the back

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.860 
much four screws holding it in the back
and<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.739> root<00:02:41.730> your<00:02:41.760> cables<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.480> way<00:02:42.810> you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and you root your cables the way you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.910 
and you root your cables the way you
want<00:02:43.140> add<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.160> power<00:02:44.340> supply<00:02:44.519> is<00:02:45.200> either<00:02:46.200> it

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
want add the power supply is either it

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.979 
want add the power supply is either it
can<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.190> mounted<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.639> top<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> case<00:02:48.299> on<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
can be mounted on top of the case on the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.349 
can be mounted on top of the case on the
bottom<00:02:49.230> depends<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> case<00:02:50.359> motor

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
bottom depends on the case motor

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.740 
bottom depends on the case motor
manufacturer<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:53.239> when<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.329> mount<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.660> top

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
manufacturer and when you mount on top

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.270 
manufacturer and when you mount on top
your<00:02:55.260> fan<00:02:55.500> obviously<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:55.920> going<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.130> point

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
your fan obviously is going to point

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.940 
your fan obviously is going to point
downwards<00:02:57.139> whereas<00:02:58.139> when<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.560> don't<00:02:58.709> mount

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
downwards whereas when you don't mount

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.289 
downwards whereas when you don't mount
at<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.250> bottom<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.880> either<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
at the bottom you can either have it

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.809 
at the bottom you can either have it
from<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.019> bottom<00:03:01.319> up<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:02.370> fan<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
from the bottom up so the fan is on the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.259 
from the bottom up so the fan is on the
bottom<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.859> ventilation<00:03:05.489> link

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
bottom and if you have ventilation link

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.960 
bottom and if you have ventilation link
here<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.889> can<00:03:07.920> have<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.400> way<00:03:08.609> I<00:03:08.639> just

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
here or you can have it this way I just

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.550 
here or you can have it this way I just
put<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.420> always<00:03:09.600> put<00:03:09.810> it<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.049> way<00:03:10.260> just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
put it all I always put it this way just

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.309 
put it all I always put it this way just
just<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.459> thing<00:03:11.639> I<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.139> way<00:03:13.260> it

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
just a thing I up and I like the way it

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.160 
just a thing I up and I like the way it
looks<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.790> only<00:03:17.970> disadvantage<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.930> put

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
looks and the only disadvantage of put

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.809 
looks and the only disadvantage of put
it<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.410> way<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.370> your<00:03:20.489> key<00:03:20.670> of

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
it this way is that you have your key of

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.000 
it this way is that you have your key of
sticking<00:03:21.090> up<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.420> side<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.870> have<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.109> get

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
sticking up this side so you have to get

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.550 
sticking up this side so you have to get
them<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.340> go<00:03:23.489> across<00:03:23.670> all<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.380> up<00:03:25.380> through

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
them to go across all the way up through

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.550 
them to go across all the way up through
the<00:03:25.709> width<00:03:25.889> of<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.130> case<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.930> after<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.410> do

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the width of the case so after you do

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.500 
the width of the case so after you do
this<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:31.069> kind<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.190> want<00:03:32.639> to<00:03:32.760> route<00:03:33.269> all

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
this and you kind of want to route all

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.550 
this and you kind of want to route all
the<00:03:33.660> cables<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.319> have<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.829> look<00:03:35.040> around<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
the cables and have a look around and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.470 
the cables and have a look around and
get<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> fair<00:03:37.889> idea<00:03:38.099> of<00:03:38.579> how<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.849> want<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.180> get

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
get a fair idea of how you want to get

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.770 
get a fair idea of how you want to get
your<00:03:39.630> cables<00:03:40.079> managed<00:03:40.970> if<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.150> have<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.299> fan<00:03:42.540> on

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
your cables managed if you have a fan on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.770 
your cables managed if you have a fan on
the<00:03:42.810> back<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.380> usually<00:03:43.859> twist<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.599> cables<00:03:45.599> or

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the back I usually twist the cables or

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.880 
the back I usually twist the cables or
an<00:03:46.169> heat<00:03:47.099> shrink<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.669> wrap<00:03:48.180> them<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.650> find

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
an heat shrink and wrap them and I find

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.590 
an heat shrink and wrap them and I find
a<00:03:49.980> good<00:03:50.159> way<00:03:50.670> to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
a good way to

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.390 
a good way to
somehow<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.660> didn't<00:03:52.930> pack<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.170> case<00:03:53.500> this

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
somehow you didn't pack the case this

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.090 
somehow you didn't pack the case this
case<00:03:54.700> has<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.120> little<00:03:55.750> notch<00:03:56.410> there<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.920> top

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
case has a little notch there on the top

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.460 
case has a little notch there on the top
so<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.580> grab<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.180> way<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.350> do

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
so you can grab it this way and you do

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.410 
so you can grab it this way and you do
with<00:03:59.620> all<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.010> fans<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:00.910> haven't<00:04:01.150> k<00:04:01.360> is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
with all the fans that you haven't k is

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.200 
with all the fans that you haven't k is
pre-installed<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:03.160> right<00:04:03.670> here<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.030> the

gonna give my friend the fair that I'm
building<00:04:23.170> their<00:04:23.440> case<00:04:23.710> 1<00:04:24.070> or<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.760> computer

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
building their case 1 or the computer

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.010 
building their case 1 or the computer
for<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.690> just<00:04:26.140> wireless<00:04:26.470> access<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.400> internet

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
for and just wireless access to internet

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.020 
for and just wireless access to internet
so<00:04:29.020> next<00:04:29.740> we're<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:30.160> to<00:04:30.250> put<00:04:30.430> in<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.610> CPU

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
so next we're going to put in the CPU

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.810 
so next we're going to put in the CPU
station<00:04:31.600> for<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.100> we're<00:04:33.280> going<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.460> do<00:04:33.580> is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
station for that so we're going to do is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.630 
station for that so we're going to do is
mount<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> CPU<00:04:35.170> right<00:04:35.380> now<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:36.310> first<00:04:36.520> thing

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
mount the CPU right now so first thing

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.200 
mount the CPU right now so first thing
you<00:04:36.700> want<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.880> do<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.240> open<00:04:37.480> up<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:39.210> socket

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
you want to do is open up the socket

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.420 
you want to do is open up the socket
it's<00:04:40.720> just<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.990> little<00:04:41.110> notch<00:04:41.380> here<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:42.280> pull

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
it's just a little notch here just pull

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.220 
it's just a little notch here just pull
it<00:04:42.550> up<00:04:42.640> like<00:04:42.910> this<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:44.470> just<00:04:44.710> opens<00:04:45.160> up

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
it up like this and that just opens up

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.980 
it up like this and that just opens up
as<00:04:47.230> you<00:04:47.350> can<00:04:47.470> see<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:48.190> opens<00:04:48.550> up<00:04:48.670> on<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.690> socket

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
as you can see it opens up on the socket

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.350 
as you can see it opens up on the socket
for<00:04:50.170> us<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.950> next<00:04:51.130> thing<00:04:51.340> we<00:04:51.490> take<00:04:51.700> out<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:51.880> cpu

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
for us so next thing we take out the cpu

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.810 
for us so next thing we take out the cpu
and<00:04:52.600> mount<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.170> in<00:04:53.320> there<00:04:53.680> okay<00:04:54.280> so<00:04:54.340> here's<00:04:54.700> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
and mount it in there okay so here's the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.909 
and mount it in there okay so here's the
chip<00:04:55.060> we're<00:04:55.330> going<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.600> put<00:04:55.930> into<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.560> socket

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
chip we're going to put into the socket

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.330 
chip we're going to put into the socket
and<00:04:57.510> when<00:04:58.510> you're<00:04:58.630> doing<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.080> you'd<00:04:59.950> want<00:05:00.220> to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
and when you're doing this you'd want to

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.530 
and when you're doing this you'd want to
pick<00:05:01.180> it<00:05:01.210> up<00:05:01.390> from<00:05:02.140> the<00:05:02.320> top<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:03.419> remember<00:05:04.419> not

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
pick it up from the top and remember not

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.830 
pick it up from the top and remember not
to<00:05:04.720> touch<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.110> pins<00:05:05.380> on<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.130> bottom<00:05:06.450> with<00:05:07.450> AMD

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
the model born now see these you don't

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.480 
the model born now see these you don't
want<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.060> talk<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.270> them<00:05:16.419> at<00:05:16.510> all<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.680> to

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
want to talk to them at all so I to

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.440 
want to talk to them at all so I to
align<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:19.390> CPU<00:05:19.930> sorry<00:05:20.830> find<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.640> cpu<00:05:22.090> with

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
the motor board you have to look for a

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.250 
the motor board you have to look for a
little<00:05:24.700> triangle<00:05:25.450> on<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.570> motor<00:05:25.870> Borden's

you<00:05:26.410> can<00:05:26.530> see<00:05:26.850> this<00:05:27.850> one<00:05:28.210> is<00:05:29.220> right<00:05:30.220> there<00:05:30.550> on

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
you can see this one is right there on

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.050 
you can see this one is right there on
the<00:05:30.820> corner<00:05:31.410> hope<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.740> can<00:05:32.919> see<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.130> if<00:05:33.910> you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
the corner hope you can see it if you

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.720 
the corner hope you can see it if you
can't<00:05:34.330> trust<00:05:34.960> me<00:05:35.200> there's<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.500> little<00:05:35.950> triangle

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
can't trust me there's a little triangle

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.120 
can't trust me there's a little triangle
point<00:05:37.210> in<00:05:38.160> that<00:05:39.160> direction<00:05:39.660> that<00:05:40.660> way<00:05:40.810> and

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
point in that direction that way and

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.490 
point in that direction that way and
there's<00:05:42.130> not<00:05:42.370> one<00:05:42.580> on<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:43.000> cpu<00:05:43.480> right<00:05:44.290> there

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
there's not one on the cpu right there

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.850 
there's not one on the cpu right there
the<00:05:44.710> golden<00:05:45.040> one<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.760> you<00:05:46.180> just<00:05:46.300> want<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.860> put

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
the golden one and you just want to put

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.659 
the golden one and you just want to put
it<00:05:47.890> in<00:05:48.270> light<00:05:49.270> so<00:05:49.800> let's<00:05:50.800> drop<00:05:50.950> it<00:05:51.160> and<00:05:51.280> don't

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
it in light so let's drop it and don't

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.700 
it in light so let's drop it and don't
push<00:05:51.820> me<00:05:51.940> don't<00:05:52.390> push<00:05:52.570> it<00:05:52.600> or<00:05:52.840> apply<00:05:53.290> any<00:05:53.470> force

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
push me don't push it or apply any force

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.580 
push me don't push it or apply any force
on<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:53.980> should<00:05:54.160> slide<00:05:54.340> back<00:05:54.610> right<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.590> you

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
on it should slide back right in you

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.530 
on it should slide back right in you
just<00:05:56.800> make<00:05:56.950> sure<00:05:57.100> it's<00:05:57.340> secure<00:05:57.610> and

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
just make sure it's secure and

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.010 
just make sure it's secure and
you<00:05:59.690> press<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.500> lever<00:06:00.650> down<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:02.720> that's<00:06:02.810> it

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
you press the lever down and that's it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.190 
you press the lever down and that's it
that's<00:06:03.740> your<00:06:03.890> CPU<00:06:04.340> installed<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.810> next<00:06:05.990> thing

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
that's your CPU installed so next thing

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.290 
that's your CPU installed so next thing
you<00:06:06.350> want<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:06.560> do<00:06:06.710> is<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.580> want<00:06:07.790> to<00:06:07.970> put<00:06:08.150> some

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
you want to do is you want to put some

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.810 
you want to do is you want to put some
thermal<00:06:08.630> compound<00:06:08.780> on<00:06:09.200> it<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.500> put<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.400> cpu

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
thermal compound on it and put a cpu

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
thermal compound on it and put a cpu
cooler<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:12.400> so<00:06:13.400> we<00:06:13.700> might<00:06:13.910> use<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.180> stock

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
cooler and so we might use the stock

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.490 
cooler and so we might use the stock
cooler<00:06:15.020> that<00:06:15.530> comes<00:06:15.800> with<00:06:16.010> AMD<00:06:16.430> or<00:06:16.460> Intel

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
cooler that comes with AMD or Intel

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.440 
cooler that comes with AMD or Intel
which<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.740> this<00:06:18.980> thing<00:06:19.430> here<00:06:19.640> I<00:06:19.850> don't<00:06:20.330> use

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
which is this thing here I don't use

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.680 
which is this thing here I don't use
that<00:06:20.480> at<00:06:20.720> all<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:21.110> use<00:06:21.520> we<00:06:22.520> have<00:06:22.700> my<00:06:23.060> aftermarket

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
that at all I use we have my aftermarket

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.180 
that at all I use we have my aftermarket
one<00:06:24.110> bought<00:06:24.380> here<00:06:24.620> which<00:06:25.100> is<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:27.070> turn<00:06:28.070> will

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
one bought here which is the turn will

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.070 
one bought here which is the turn will
take<00:06:28.370> 30<00:06:28.640> and<00:06:28.970> we're<00:06:29.480> going<00:06:29.600> to<00:06:29.630> solve<00:06:29.870> it<00:06:29.960> now

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
take 30 and we're going to solve it now

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.370 
take 30 and we're going to solve it now
so<00:06:30.950> just<00:06:31.190> give<00:06:31.460> me<00:06:31.520> sec<00:06:31.900> okay<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:32.960> this<00:06:33.170> is<00:06:33.350> a

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
so just give me sec okay so this is a

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.350 
so just give me sec okay so this is a
cpu<00:06:33.860> cooler<00:06:34.130> we're<00:06:34.370> going<00:06:34.640> with<00:06:34.820> as<00:06:35.090> you<00:06:35.240> can

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
cpu cooler we're going with as you can

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.450 
cpu cooler we're going with as you can
see<00:06:35.540> it's<00:06:35.750> not<00:06:35.900> the<00:06:36.140> small<00:06:36.440> cpu<00:06:37.010> cooler<00:06:37.250> and

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
see it's not the small cpu cooler and

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.810 
see it's not the small cpu cooler and
it's<00:06:37.550> definitely<00:06:37.790> not<00:06:37.910> to<00:06:38.120> like<00:06:38.240> this<00:06:38.420> one<00:06:38.630> so

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
it's definitely not to like this one so

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.430 
it's definitely not to like this one so
usually<00:06:40.820> to<00:06:41.270> mount<00:06:41.480> these<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:42.230> have

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
usually to mount these you have

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.390 
usually to mount these you have
instructions<00:06:43.250> and<00:06:44.740> mounting<00:06:45.740> plates<00:06:46.010> that

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
instructions and mounting plates that

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.910 
instructions and mounting plates that
come<00:06:46.640> with<00:06:46.880> the<00:06:47.000> cpu<00:06:47.410> so<00:06:48.410> i'm<00:06:48.530> going<00:06:48.620> to<00:06:48.710> do<00:06:48.830> i'm

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
come with the cpu so i'm going to do i'm

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.680 
come with the cpu so i'm going to do i'm
just<00:06:48.980> going<00:06:49.220> to<00:06:49.250> mount<00:06:49.490> it<00:06:49.760> on<00:06:49.910> to<00:06:50.210> the<00:06:50.330> cpu

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 
just going to mount it on to the cpu

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.360 
just going to mount it on to the cpu
it'sit's<00:06:51.230> you<00:06:51.830> just<00:06:52.040> follow<00:06:52.220> the

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
it'sit's you just follow the

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.740 
it'sit's you just follow the
instructions<00:06:52.400> on<00:06:53.060> there<00:06:53.270> and<00:06:54.340> that<00:06:55.340> should<00:06:55.610> be

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750 
instructions on there and that should be

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.190 
instructions on there and that should be
your<00:06:56.750> cpu<00:06:57.880> cooler<00:06:58.880> on<00:06:59.090> so<00:06:59.450> stay<00:06:59.990> tuned<00:07:00.170> for

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
your cpu cooler on so stay tuned for
