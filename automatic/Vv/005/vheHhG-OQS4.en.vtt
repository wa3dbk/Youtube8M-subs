probably all three games in one just the
highlights<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.770> biggest<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
highlights but the biggest thing I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
highlights but the biggest thing I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
noticed when will be the show is that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.360 
noticed when will be the show is that
sometimes<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.800> don't<00:00:58.920> even<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.280> any

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
sometimes you don't even get any

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
sometimes you don't even get any
fielding<00:00:59.820> opportunities<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> would<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fielding opportunities like I would go

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810

two<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.500> three<00:01:01.649> games<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.219> field<00:01:02.460> once

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
two or three games and that field once

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
two or three games and that field once
and<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.480> would<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> bats<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.369> would

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
but try making Derek Jeter as best as I

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.120 
but try making Derek Jeter as best as I
could

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
could

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
could
I<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.820> couldn't<00:01:57.450> even<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.930> him<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> right

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I I couldn't even make him the right

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
I I couldn't even make him the right
weight<00:01:59.280> actually<00:01:59.610> he<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.329> believe<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.689> was

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
weight actually he was I believe it was

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
weight actually he was I believe it was
160<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.649> he<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> rookie<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.729> lowest<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
160 when he was a rookie the lowest this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
160 when he was a rookie the lowest this
would<00:02:03.450> let<00:02:03.600> me<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.439> 170<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.549> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
would let me do it was like 170 so I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.089 
would let me do it was like 170 so I
went<00:02:05.850> ahead<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.149> stuck<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.899> believe<00:02:07.320> 180

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
went ahead and stuck with I believe 180

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.290 
went ahead and stuck with I believe 180
just<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.899> 170<00:02:10.500> guys<00:02:10.649> look

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
just because the 170 guys look

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.390 
just because the 170 guys look
really<00:02:11.660> scrawny<00:02:11.990> skinny<00:02:12.440> which<00:02:12.740> probably<00:02:13.310> had

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
really scrawny skinny which probably had

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700 
really scrawny skinny which probably had
their<00:02:13.550> jitter<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.000> look<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:15.050> know<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.200> I

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
their jitter to look but you know I I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.190 
their jitter to look but you know I I
don't<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.420> would<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.780> been<00:02:17.930> nice

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
don't think that it would have been nice

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
don't think that it would have been nice
visually<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.220> gave<00:02:19.370> him<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.490> little<00:02:19.580> bit<00:02:19.730> more

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
visually so I gave him a little bit more

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.890 
visually so I gave him a little bit more
meat<00:02:20.180> he<00:02:20.900> does<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.590> his<00:02:22.010> father's<00:02:22.790> stance<00:02:23.420> so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
meat he does have his father's stance so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.350 
meat he does have his father's stance so
