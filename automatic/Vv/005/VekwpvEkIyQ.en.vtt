compared to alfalfa and forages so you

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.140

to<00:02:58.170> anyone<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.620> maybe<00:02:59.099> we<00:02:59.430> shouldn't<00:02:59.700> be

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
to anyone that maybe we shouldn't be

all that dairy and instead maybe we

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.710 
all that dairy and instead maybe we

complicated<00:03:46.950> issue<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.700> wish<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.180> were<00:03:48.299> that

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
complicated issue I wish it were that

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.960 
complicated issue I wish it were that
simple<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:49.230> it's<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.889> little-known<00:03:50.160> fact<00:03:50.340> that

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
simple and it's a little-known fact that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.150 
simple and it's a little-known fact that
about<00:03:51.209> one-third<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.440> animal<00:03:52.919> feed

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
about one-third of all the animal feed

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.839 
about one-third of all the animal feed
grown<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.579> California<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.750> shipped<00:03:55.109> overseas

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
grown in California is shipped overseas

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.729 
grown in California is shipped overseas
primarily<00:03:56.849> to<00:03:57.150> Asian<00:03:57.629> countries<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.709> that

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
primarily to Asian countries so that

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.309 
primarily to Asian countries so that
they<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.310> raise<00:03:59.579> their<00:03:59.870> livestock<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.290> meat

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
they can raise their livestock for meat

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.940 
they can raise their livestock for meat
and<00:04:01.769> dairy<00:04:02.280> products<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.500> mentioned<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.620> fact

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
and dairy products I mentioned this fact

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.550 
and dairy products I mentioned this fact
because<00:04:05.489> see<00:04:06.090> we<00:04:06.389> are<00:04:06.510> somehow<00:04:06.840> able<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.410> go

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
because see we are somehow able to go

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.610 
because see we are somehow able to go
vegan<00:04:07.859> here<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.370> California<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.389> reduce<00:04:10.319> or

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
vegan here in California and reduce or

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.530 
vegan here in California and reduce or
eliminate<00:04:10.739> our<00:04:11.220> need<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.519> all<00:04:11.790> this<00:04:11.940> animal

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
eliminate our need for all this animal

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.960 
eliminate our need for all this animal
feed<00:04:12.810> while<00:04:13.079> all<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.919> ammo<00:04:14.129> feed<00:04:14.549> would<00:04:14.699> still

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
feed while all the ammo feed would still

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.969 
feed while all the ammo feed would still
be<00:04:15.120> grown<00:04:15.419> by<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.660> feed<00:04:15.989> growers<00:04:16.410> but<00:04:16.859> they

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
be grown by the feed growers but they

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.409 
be grown by the feed growers but they
would<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.160> increase<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.030> amount<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.359> that

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
would just increase the amount of that

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.589 
would just increase the amount of that
feed<00:04:18.690> exported<00:04:19.530> overseas<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.239> guys<00:04:21.449> I

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
feed exported overseas so you guys I

feed exported overseas so you guys I
told<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.079> really<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:22.680> complicated

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
told you it's really really complicated

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.490 
told you it's really really complicated

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
who knew that so much of our water is

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.670 
who knew that so much of our water is
being<00:04:25.740> exported<00:04:26.190> overseas<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.240> four

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
being exported overseas and the four

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.280
