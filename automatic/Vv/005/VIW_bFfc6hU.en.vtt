My name is Simon Lahaye, I'm a Flight Service Specialist at Nav Canada.

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:18.152
I work at Sept-Iles airport.

00:00:18.753 --> 00:00:25.226
Our main job is ensuring safe and efficient aircraft movements, on arrivals and departures.

00:00:26.563 --> 00:00:29.563
We communicate with pilots over radio.

00:00:44.478 --> 00:00:48.149
One of our responsibilities is also controlling vehicules on the airport.

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:51.819
Communications are done in both official languages - engligh and french.

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.573
Controllers and FSS have slightly different procedures.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.312
Controllers provide separation. FSS provide trafic information.

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:23.784
Our work tools are: mainly visual observation,

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.321
radar,

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.091
flight data strips.

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:50.880
We're also in charge of airport weather observations.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:04.360
A prerequisite would be a desire to learn.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:08.660
You must also be willing to move.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.670
Most FSS positions are in regional airports:

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:17.840
Sept-Iles. (here)

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:19.970
