Freight portable huge utility pump it
says<00:00:10.550> 25<00:00:11.059> gallons<00:00:11.480> per<00:00:11.630> minute<00:00:11.719> it's<00:00:12.650> got<00:00:12.830> to

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
says 25 gallons per minute it's got to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.589 
says 25 gallons per minute it's got to
be<00:00:13.009> at<00:00:13.099> least<00:00:13.160> 10<00:00:13.759> to<00:00:13.790> 20<00:00:14.240> I<00:00:14.269> don't<00:00:14.480> know<00:00:14.540> about

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
be at least 10 to 20 I don't know about

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.400 
be at least 10 to 20 I don't know about
25<00:00:15.139> but<00:00:15.530> I<00:00:15.799> didn't<00:00:16.070> measure<00:00:16.219> it<00:00:17.110> we<00:00:18.110> just<00:00:18.230> have

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
25 but I didn't measure it we just have

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.120 
25 but I didn't measure it we just have
power<00:00:19.660> running<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.900> pump<00:00:21.110> you<00:00:21.950> have<00:00:22.040> the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
power running to the pump you have the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.480 
power running to the pump you have the
inlet<00:00:22.400> hose<00:00:23.260> sucking<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:24.410> water<00:00:24.920> off<00:00:25.220> of<00:00:25.250> my

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
inlet hose sucking the water off of my

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.190 
inlet hose sucking the water off of my
pool<00:00:25.730> cover<00:00:26.030> so<00:00:26.360> we<00:00:26.480> could<00:00:26.600> open<00:00:26.690> it<00:00:26.870> up<00:00:27.020> for

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
pool cover so we could open it up for

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.520 
pool cover so we could open it up for
the<00:00:27.260> summer<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.750> it<00:00:29.750> doesn't<00:00:30.080> look<00:00:30.200> like<00:00:30.350> much

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
the summer and it doesn't look like much

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.260 
the summer and it doesn't look like much
as<00:00:30.740> moving<00:00:31.070> there's<00:00:31.250> there's<00:00:31.490> a<00:00:31.550> little<00:00:31.850> on

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
as moving there's there's a little on

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.590 
as moving there's there's a little on
the<00:00:32.450> end<00:00:32.570> of<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.780> they<00:00:33.710> give<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.600> little

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
the end of the they give you a little

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.150 
the end of the they give you a little
kind<00:00:35.810> of<00:00:35.900> screen<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.530> put<00:00:36.680> on<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.860> end<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.040> your

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
kind of screen to put on the end of your

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.680 
kind of screen to put on the end of your
hose<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:38.660> keep<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:40.070> big<00:00:40.670> large<00:00:41.000> debris<00:00:41.360> going

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
hose to keep a big large debris going

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.770 
hose to keep a big large debris going
through<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:42.230> you<00:00:42.410> really<00:00:42.680> want<00:00:42.890> to<00:00:43.750> try<00:00:44.750> to

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
through it but you really want to try to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.390 
through it but you really want to try to
prevent<00:00:45.410> that<00:00:45.530> from<00:00:45.650> happening<00:00:45.860> in<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.250> first

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
prevent that from happening in the first

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.990 
prevent that from happening in the first
place<00:00:47.410> so<00:00:48.410> that<00:00:48.440> goes<00:00:48.860> into<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:49.760> pump

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
place so that goes into the pump

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
place so that goes into the pump
club<00:00:51.540> runs<00:00:52.200> not<00:00:52.620> too<00:00:52.800> loud<00:00:53.040> you<00:00:53.610> prime<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
club runs not too loud you prime it of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.490 
club runs not too loud you prime it of
course<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.100> then<00:00:56.600> I'm<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.840> running<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.470> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
course and then I'm just running it to a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.120 
course and then I'm just running it to a
drain<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.580> on<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.240> you<00:01:00.360> could<00:01:00.510> tell<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:00.900> it's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
drain and on of you could tell but it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.710 
drain and on of you could tell but it's
it's<00:01:02.130> moving<00:01:02.580> pretty<00:01:02.610> well<00:01:02.910> definitely

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
it's moving pretty well definitely

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's moving pretty well definitely
faster<00:01:04.380> like<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.520> least<00:01:05.610> twice<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.030> fast<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
faster like at least twice as fast and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.090 
faster like at least twice as fast and
my<00:01:06.480> garden<00:01:06.810> hose<00:01:06.930> could<00:01:07.170> fill<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.530> pool<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
my garden hose could fill this pool so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.820 
my garden hose could fill this pool so
there<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.730> say<00:01:12.030> at<00:01:12.150> least

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
there you have it I would say at least

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
there you have it I would say at least
15<00:01:13.830> gallons<00:01:14.190> per<00:01:14.310> minute<00:01:16.760> yeah<00:01:17.760> if<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
15 gallons per minute yeah if you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.270 
15 gallons per minute yeah if you
basically<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.870> hook<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.230> your<00:01:19.860> intake

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
basically you hook up your your intake

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
basically you hook up your your intake
your<00:01:20.700> exhaust<00:01:21.000> hoses<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.600> also<00:01:21.750> give<00:01:22.050> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
your exhaust hoses they also give you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.859 
your exhaust hoses they also give you
some<00:01:22.200> couplers<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:22.830> adapt<00:01:23.369> depending<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.240> what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
some couplers to adapt depending on what

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.930 
some couplers to adapt depending on what
kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.080> hose<00:01:25.229> ends<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
kind of hose ends you have this is the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.670 
kind of hose ends you have this is the
this<00:01:27.300> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> filling<00:01:28.229> cap<00:01:28.440> you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
this is the filling cap you

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.680 
this is the filling cap you
remove<00:01:31.370> this<00:01:31.550> you<00:01:31.790> basically<00:01:32.270> fill<00:01:32.510> with

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
remove this you basically fill with

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.240 
remove this you basically fill with
water<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.050> prime<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.320> pump<00:01:33.380> seal<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.100> with<00:01:34.220> a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
water to prime the pump seal it with a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.940 
water to prime the pump seal it with a
pipe<00:01:34.460> wrench<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.020> off<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.170> goes<00:01:36.200> I've<00:01:36.710> had

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
pipe wrench and off it goes I've had

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.160 
pipe wrench and off it goes I've had
this<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:37.430> maybe<00:01:38.090> six<00:01:38.390> months<00:01:38.570> there's<00:01:38.960> some

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170

rust around here but nothing that I
can't<00:01:41.540> clean<00:01:41.750> off<00:01:41.930> hey<00:01:42.350> bud<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:44.590> there<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.710> go

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
can't clean off hey bud and there you go

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.070 
can't clean off hey bud and there you go
so<00:01:45.890> in<00:01:46.250> an<00:01:46.640> hour<00:01:46.760> so<00:01:47.180> all<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:47.540> water<00:01:47.810> should

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
so in an hour so all this water should

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.030 
so in an hour so all this water should
be<00:01:48.110> off<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.790> I'll<00:01:49.790> be<00:01:49.970> able<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.830> open<00:01:51.830> up<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
be off and I'll be able to open up the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.860 
be off and I'll be able to open up the
pool<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.460> then<00:01:52.550> pump<00:01:53.030> some<00:01:53.210> water<00:01:53.240> back<00:01:53.600> in

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
pool and then pump some water back in

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.310 
pool and then pump some water back in
from<00:01:54.260> from<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.620> hose

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 

yeah<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.190> have<00:02:02.580> I<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.120> end<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
yeah so I just have I have the end of

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.120 
yeah so I just have I have the end of
the<00:02:03.420> hose<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.810> weighted<00:02:04.590> under<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.890> grate

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the hose here weighted under the grate

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.860 
the hose here weighted under the grate
so<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.550> doesn't<00:02:05.880> splash<00:02:06.120> everywhere<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
so it doesn't splash everywhere and I

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.050 
so it doesn't splash everywhere and I
have<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> water<00:02:07.410> directed<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.960> that's<00:02:09.960> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
have the water directed and that's the
