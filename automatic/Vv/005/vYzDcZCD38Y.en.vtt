00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.100
 the building at the corner led the trains 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.649
 many have a bad reputation 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.050
 questions bypass the Soviet years 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.110
 here was located the state committee 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 security and since 1991 the state 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.320
 police 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.109
 soviet state security agencies 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 appeared here in june 1940 and already 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 two months later in the courtyard 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.609
 the building was equipped with an investigative 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.590
 insulator 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.750
 no matter how you treat those today 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.429
 events undoubtedly one in years 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 Stalinist repression through the basement and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.660
 this building passed thousands of people or 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.140
 further fate evolved differently 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.420
 on most gone in the gulag today 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.920
 their memory was honored by the actor being 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.920
 theater neighborhood is given 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.699
 remand prison did not stay 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.829
 unclaimed and in modern times 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.289
 his convenience of their quotes had to 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.079
 take advantage of many eminent guests 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.129
 have work you can talk write 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.979
 Yes, but after 20 25 years when there already 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.070
 cartoon not because here in principle 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.340
 there were all people who were about 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 who wrote in the newspapers means if 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.369
 some big deal there the saudis 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.289
 former members of the existing police 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.479
 today a former state building 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.970
 police peace and quiet except 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.280
 appear quietly and cast from 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.340
 former inmates scissors told 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.000
 about crispy women's skirts 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.590
 at night when no one guy with a duty 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.600
 parts of the post below says that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.380
 the steps could be heard 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.340
 Of course the building is old it is in itself 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.009
 already 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.229
 let's say so move probably if 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.840
 did you notice that this building is actually 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.179
 Keeps almost only on wires 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.750
 maybe there are people after all 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.270
 have not left here yet and are waiting for the day when 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 they will finally find peace all this much 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.319
 aggravates the state agency 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.050
 real estate search new tenants 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.569
 moreover, the building requires very large 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.530
 investment of the order of a thousand lats on 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.470
 square meter 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.220
 besides, the aura here leaves much to be desired 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.650
 always the best 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.620
 somehow unpleasant when people go even 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.170
 past this house already look at him like that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.900
 aslant and you leave it and as if 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 would you feel some guilt up 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.240
 the moment you are in charge 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 that that human memory was happening 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.800
 selective today, few people remember 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.170
 what a gorgeous art nouveau house on 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.390
 alberta 13 before the war was located 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
 first political police department 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.290
 Latvian Republic where also not 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 stand on ceremony with the arrested 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.910
 dissenters and today among 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.780
 Numerous institutions of firms here by 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.050
 irony of fate 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.420
 is the office of the Latvian Association
