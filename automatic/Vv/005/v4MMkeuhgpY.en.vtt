now<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> first<00:03:28.519> time<00:03:28.670> it<00:03:28.820> does<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.570> does

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
now the first time it does this it does

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.110 
now the first time it does this it does
it<00:03:29.959> reasonably<00:03:30.620> quickly<00:03:30.920> but<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:32.000> do

it reasonably quickly but you have to do

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.509 
it reasonably quickly but you have to do
it<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.269> second<00:03:32.720> time<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.560> actually<00:03:33.739> complete

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
it a second time to actually complete

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.910 
it a second time to actually complete
the<00:03:34.670> process<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.810> once<00:03:36.019> this<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.350> done<00:03:36.500> once

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the process so once this is done once

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.160 
the process so once this is done once
you<00:03:37.310> go<00:03:37.790> through<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.300> do<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.570> exactly<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
you go through and you do it exactly the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.080 
you go through and you do it exactly the
same<00:03:39.380> again<00:03:39.620> just<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.070> last<00:03:40.250> step<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.030> will

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
same again just the last step and I will

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.810 
same again just the last step and I will
show<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.510> how<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.780> do<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.620> then<00:03:43.220> once

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
show you how to do that and then once

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.410 
show you how to do that and then once
that's<00:03:44.060> done<00:03:44.239> we<00:03:44.900> simply<00:03:45.109> reboot<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:46.269> we<00:03:47.269> will

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
that's done we simply reboot and we will

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.630 
that's done we simply reboot and we will

back<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:27.370> do<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.480> reboot<00:04:29.770> reboot<00:04:30.770> system<00:04:31.220> now

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
back and do a reboot reboot system now

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.210 
back and do a reboot reboot system now
and<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.960> first<00:04:33.170> time<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.500> boots<00:04:33.740> up<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.070> does

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
and the first time this boots up it does

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.250 
and the first time this boots up it does
actually<00:04:34.400> take<00:04:34.580> quite<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:35.060> long<00:04:35.330> time<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.660> boot

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260
