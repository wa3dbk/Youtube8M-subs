00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.600
 - How are you? - 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.280
 Well. 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380
 - First trip, first press trip - 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.070
 Yes, the train is driving, it is not cold. 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.630
 The light goes, 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.730
 I can not complain. 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.980
 No, it works very well! 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.680
 6 months ago it was a lot harder than it is now. 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.240
 It was a hard time, but now 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.340
 the trains are running, everything has become beautiful. 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.770
 The trains are super comfortable. 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.630
 - Are all there? - 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 Yes. Are all there! 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.000
 - That means the 11th is? - 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.780
 The 11th is. Full operation. 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.720
 - On the homepage there are a few things 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.080
 that do not work yet. - 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.390
 We will release it only at the last moment. 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.490
 There are some legal questions, 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.490
 partly implementation issues, 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.860
 but on the 11th everything will work. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.080
 - That means reservation for wheelchair users ... - 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.190
 Naturally. They do not need a reservation. 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.170
 - Okay, but on a sticky holiday you want to drive more. - 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.860
 Of course, then you want to sign up. 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.360
 But in itself they do not need it. 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 - About 5-1717, or just about your own? - 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.640
 About our own. The 5-1717 does not do anything with us. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.240
 - Since you are in the timetable of ÖBB. - 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.660
 Yes, but we have so much space. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.510
 Especially for wheelchair users is no problem at all. 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.680
 - All right, it's 2nd - 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.190
 We have for 3 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.510
 with socket here. 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.520
 We also have a lot of space everywhere else in the car. 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.420
 And through the level entry ... 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.690
 How did you get in? 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.160
 - Yes, without problems. - 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.370
 Without problems, right? That's the point. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 - That's fine. - 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 - Will we still see how the toilets work? - 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.160
 Can you look, are great. 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.590
 - Yes, I'm curious. - 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 Try it out please. 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.480
 Test service. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 - Do they really believe that they can keep that 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.640
 in each turn a person? - 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.750
 Yes of course. We do not have anyone in the stations for that. 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.860
 In Summer we need fewer people like the ÖBB. 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 - There are also platforms that are too low, 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.120
 I think Wels is one of them. - 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.870
 Attnang Puchheim and Amstetten 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.900
 - Wels not? - 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.480
 Catfish not. Attnang Puchheim and Amstetten, as far as I know. 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.180
 - There you need the ÖBB ramp (lift). - 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 Then you need the ramp (lift). 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.780
 - How does this work, you have to call there at the ÖBB 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.360
 or ... - 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.170
 We do that. 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.550
 - That means you just get in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.080
 tell the train staff and they'll take care of it. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.240
 Yes exactly. 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.860
 - In the time, usually you have to at the ÖBB 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.540
 Always book a few days in advance. - 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.880
 We have a contract with them. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.280
 We organize that. 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.990
 - Okay. Cool thing. - 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.790
 We try everything that the guest just has to get started 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.240
 and we do the rest. 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.540
 - As a guest in a wheelchair or as a disabled person, you know 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.440
 that it is always tried 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.190
 but mostly it does not work. - 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.400
 Yes, but we have at almost all stations 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
 no problem with getting in and out. 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.700
 On the train we take care of ourselves for the guests. 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.960
 Then there are the few interfaces 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.490
 which we have to take away in the next few years. 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.260
 - I would still be interested in the Westbahn buses. 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 Barrier-free or not? - 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.110
 Not. 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.860
 - Graz does not work. - 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.400
 No, Graz is not working. 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.160
 - But there are barrier-free buses. - 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.510
 But we do not have them that fast 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.610
 can order in the crowd. 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.140
 But of course that's a goal, no question. 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.670
 The first goal is to switch to the train as soon as possible. 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.320
 The second goal is to have PRM possible buses in the meantime. 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.670
 Naturally. 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.240
 - Okay, let's see ... 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.260
 - I wish you much success with it ... - 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.250
 Thank you! Thanks, you can. 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.290
 - And I'm looking forward to it. - 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.640
 Me too.
