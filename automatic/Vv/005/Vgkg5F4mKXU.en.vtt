 That the long pole 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.790
 It is a concept 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.770
 Hey 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.300
 There are two of these 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.079
 right 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.620
 Thick and thin 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.010
 These two types 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.660
 It is release in Japan 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.420
 So far undecided 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.990
 I'll let you sell for a while in the sense that some people say 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.360
 In a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
 Sau's 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.400
 It is target fish, but is this 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.659
 Ito's mark is included 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:24.579
 There is more 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.409
 Daimyo Yu It is a kite to aim at the size of this 1 meter color with big bait 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.570
 so 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.640
 reel 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.810
 It's standard I set it when I put on the 5000 reel 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.399
 It 's a setting with good kanji characters. 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.399
 Here is a thicker 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.310
 I'm getting a little attention 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 I toward what or big bait that 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.820
 It is a guy who is said variously that it is good 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:59.070
 The length of 83 is the size that fits in the long of that plane too 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.280
 If you unplug this, it will be the same size as the previous 78 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.990
 Mostly manufacturers 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.460
 I wonder if 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.380
 It is not at all, but it is supposed to fit around 17089180 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.400
 Ye 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.270
 This is a trap for european wild catfish 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 Hang on the 2 meter fish by feeding 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.290
 It seems to say 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.650
 ana 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.180
 Here 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.740
 Joined claw 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.110

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.860
 Big bait's cat 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.250
 I think the size of the fork is being thrown 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.720
 About this icicle 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.520
 The thin person who assumed it to use in Ito first 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 I 'm making this though 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.500
 It is a little bitty person size of me this 148 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.910
 Even if it's a bit light, you can throw at all 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.090
 Please think that the first size 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.720
 This is 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.150
 I feel just right 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.239
 This than Mochoi Okkii 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.060
 Well, I'm sorry I'm sorry for my own work 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.980
 It's a little heavy by this 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.980
 Any kind of minute little heavy guy this 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.630
 It is this that has become a serve that is thrown at all 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.580
 It's almost like this for Ito 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.090
 So to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.569
 If you have Welcome the person that if used in the bus 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 If you can refer to this side of the day 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.900
 I think 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900
 ana 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.050
 Next aaa 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.020
 Here 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.330
 It is one for catfish 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.600
 I'm 83 but 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.230
 From this 178 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.350
 It feels like throwing it, of course when it comes to saying in Big Bait 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.460
 It's made for the fight of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.430
 I still don't know what to say when throwing that big bait 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.359
 but 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:10.680
 Don't go above this at all in the feeling of throwing 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:12.270
 I think that you should be based on the size above 178 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.670
 83 of you 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:21.049
 The lightest of the specs that I 'm throwing is the 178's around here 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.560
 If you say more than this size 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.949
 I just do not know how long I can go 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.949
 Because 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.569
 Just ask a friend and a mother and a twitter are also great Yao 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.529
 I think I've been throwing it once 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.529
 Then please 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.830
 me 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.200
 tan
