 you are going to see touch a lot here the game 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 since I left everything so a little open 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 because I recorded it with my mobile phone and I'm not going to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.360
 be with one hand recording and with the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.609
 the other here fingering the box and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 shit pulse with both hands or be 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.290
 I read one that for what and good here as 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.530
 you see we can see from the box is a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.280
 little touched by the corners since 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 if you think about this box 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.330
 well this game came out in 1996 and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 Quietly, he may be 17 years old 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.710
 and well, this was this and the pokemon 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.430
 red were the first to leave for 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.770
 the gameboy 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.170
 they left first in japan then at 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.730
 time they took out the blue pokemon and then 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.240
 already in 1999 came the good those who 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.310
 red and blue arrived in Europe 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.000
 if you buy the pokemon that come out here 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.610
 in the green and in the red of japan with 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.790
 Those who came to Europe will see that 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.310
 to be older are worse made 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.740
 drawings of the pokemon and such and such 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.399
 As you can see here the map is also 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 in quite good condition the manual 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.280
 It was also very good and good was 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.590
 pretty colorful he was pretty handsome 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.450
 how have you done it and such not like 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.040
 manuals that do now that maybe 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.560
 to put a booklet there in white and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.170
 black or a manual and in black and white and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.689
 nobody is going to read it 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.229
 and well, this was brought to me from 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.110
 Japan I asked for it and it arrived at 9 days 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.600
 there cost me about 25 euros more or 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.399
