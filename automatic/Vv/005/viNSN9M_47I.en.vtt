00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello, I'm Marcel Schmelzer and I 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 am here today for Peter our first 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 Little Prince was the exit smaller 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.980
 jack russell terrier and the second 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.720
 hymns has been mimi the we from 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.900
 Italy then depending on Germany to us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 have brought from the breeder guest but 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.590
 By now we are just that too 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 opinion that there are many dogs 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.480
 the easy in the shelter or on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.059
 the street or otherwise wait 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 to belong to a simple family 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.899
 because there are no bad dogs and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.010
 as we have just considered how can 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.440
 we just go there a bit more 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.969
 bring more and have the stop 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 ears held open and then came this 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.840
 info known by us to the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.370
 Animal welfare project in Italy knows yes there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 We have the mini now for the first time 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 seen and that made us so cute and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.590
 in love looked and there we could 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.390
 just do not resist and have them 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.109
 then four weeks later then with 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 Germany brought 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 In the beginning we were very careful 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 we hope we do not do anything 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
 wrong as i am even more scared i have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.479
 think that the oscar was very important 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.030
 also with regard to other dogs almost two 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.950
 So here at home is the faces 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.439
 They really only like to relax 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.360
 but would like to sleep and eat soon 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.240

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.000

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.890
