00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.130

 it was also David's idea yes but it would have 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.860
 that overcoming it a little is no longer 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.230
 that creates a drastic change of 180 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.820
 degrees and that's why it will not because 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 wants is that they are always laughing and 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.210

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.560

 gypsy community I suppose 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.090
