we're<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.200> gonna<00:00:46.500> burn<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> onion<00:00:47.370> butter

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
we're not gonna burn the onion butter
we<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.750> couldn't<00:00:48.989> ensure<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
we just couldn't ensure that it kind of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
we just couldn't ensure that it kind of
cooks<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.210> becomes<00:00:51.510> nice<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.780> soft<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
cooks that becomes nice and soft and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.790 
cooks that becomes nice and soft and
it's<00:00:52.860> good<00:00:53.210> okay<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.930> reason<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.530> burn

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
it's good okay the reason we don't burn

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's good okay the reason we don't burn
this<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.789> burn<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.390> for

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this is because if you burn this for

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
this is because if you burn this for
even<00:00:57.960> by<00:00:58.109> mistake<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.640> could<00:00:59.850> mask<00:01:00.120> your

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
even by mistake in it it could mask your

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470 
even by mistake in it it could mask your
burns<00:01:00.750> flavor<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.670> burnt<00:01:02.910> onions

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
burns flavor and be the burnt onions

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
burns flavor and be the burnt onions
will<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> float<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.159> top<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
will then kind of float on top of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.690 
will then kind of float on top of the
dark<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.590> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> doesn't<00:01:08.130> even<00:01:08.400> get<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
dark and it kind of doesn't even get a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
dark and it kind of doesn't even get a
good<00:01:08.880> appearance<00:01:09.270> more<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> changed<00:01:10.350> okay

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
good appearance more of the changed okay

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
good appearance more of the changed okay
so<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.180> let<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.630> become<00:01:12.840> nice

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so I'm just gonna let this become nice

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
so I'm just gonna let this become nice
and<00:01:13.200> soft<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.820> may<00:01:15.000> take<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.110> know

and soft this may take about you know

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
and soft this may take about you know
five<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> six<00:01:16.830> minutes<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.250> low<00:01:17.310> flame<00:01:17.700> my

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
five to six minutes on low flame my

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570 
five to six minutes on low flame my
onions<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.780> nicely<00:01:18.990> cooked<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.040> going<00:01:20.400> to

onions are nicely cooked I'm going to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840 
onions are nicely cooked I'm going to
add<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.570> ginger-garlic<00:01:21.990> paste<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.950> diluted

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
add some ginger-garlic paste a diluted

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.050 
add some ginger-garlic paste a diluted
in<00:01:24.000> water<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.100> important<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> dilute

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
in water so it's important to dilute

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
in water so it's important to dilute
this<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.479> water<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.579> otherwise<00:01:30.020> since<00:01:31.020> we

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
this in water because otherwise since we

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
this in water because otherwise since we
do<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> two-step<00:01:31.770> Turki<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.880> keep<00:01:33.119> your

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
do a two-step Turki it will keep your

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
do a two-step Turki it will keep your
raw<00:01:33.570> flavor<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.740> ginger<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> garlic

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
raw flavor of the ginger and the garlic

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.749 
raw flavor of the ginger and the garlic

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
which is not very desirable for this gun

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
which is not very desirable for this gun
so<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.869> take<00:01:40.020> some<00:01:40.229> ginger<00:01:40.380> garlic<00:01:40.650> paste

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.350 
so just take some ginger garlic paste
dilute<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.750> 3-4

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360
