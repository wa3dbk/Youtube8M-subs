2<00:00:33.770> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.040> episode<00:00:35.190> we'll<00:00:35.520> probably

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
2 in the first episode we'll probably

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
2 in the first episode we'll probably
end<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.940> using<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> hbr<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.079> really

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
end up using the hbr a but it really

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
end up using the hbr a but it really
depends<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> map<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> let's<00:00:38.820> hop<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
depends on the map and let's hop into a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.660 
depends on the map and let's hop into a
game<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> we'll<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.899> how<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.550> all<00:00:41.550> right

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
game and we'll see how we do all right

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.740 
game and we'll see how we do all right
guys<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.090> looks<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.600> got

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.569 
guys here we go looks like we got
instinct<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> should<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.280> should<00:00:44.550> be

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
instinct this should this one should be

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.950 
instinct this should this one should be
pretty<00:00:44.789> interesting<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.420> i<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> use

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
pretty interesting i think i want to use

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.139 
pretty interesting i think i want to use
the<00:00:46.079> hbr<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the hbr a for this one just because I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
the hbr a for this one just because I
don't<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> very<00:00:48.809> many<00:00:49.050> classes<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.680> up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
don't have a very many classes set up

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
don't have a very many classes set up
with<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:49.980> adjustable<00:00:50.820> stock<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
with the adjustable stock which is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.959 
with the adjustable stock which is
needed<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.140> challenge<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.969> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
needed for this challenge really and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
needed for this challenge really and
this<00:00:54.210> one's<00:00:54.449> probably<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.230> best<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.620> have

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
this one's probably the best one I have

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
this one's probably the best one I have
from<00:00:56.129> longer<00:00:56.460> ranges<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
from longer ranges and this is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.529 
from longer ranges and this is
definitely<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> longer<00:00:58.800> ranged<00:00:59.539> game

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
definitely gonna be a longer ranged game

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.560 
definitely gonna be a longer ranged game
I<00:01:01.219> want<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.370> away<00:01:02.460> from<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.850> temple<00:01:03.270> area

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
I want to get away from that temple area

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
I want to get away from that temple area
that's<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> key<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.610> have

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that's the key right now and I do have

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.399 
that's the key right now and I do have
my<00:01:05.880> sensitivity<00:01:06.420> turned<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.320> bit

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
my sensitivity turned up a little bit

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
my sensitivity turned up a little bit
just<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:08.189> want<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.670> ability<00:01:09.150> to

track targets if they jump or something

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.700 
track targets if they jump or something
because<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.060> i<00:01:12.510> guess<00:01:12.930> i<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.170> i<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> double

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because I i guess i can i can double

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
because I i guess i can i can double
jump<00:01:13.860> without<00:01:14.130> coming<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.970> me<00:01:15.030> down

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
jump without coming out of a me down

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.140 
jump without coming out of a me down
site<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.540> i<00:01:15.570> can't<00:01:15.810> dash<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.259> all<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:17.490> makes

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
come out of aiming down site that's just

this guy is I gotta back off back off I

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.230 
this guy is I gotta back off back off I
had<00:06:46.990> teammates<00:06:47.350> over<00:06:47.560> there<00:06:47.710> I<00:06:48.030> was<00:06:49.030> sure<00:06:49.210> I

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
had teammates over there I was sure I

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.879 
had teammates over there I was sure I
had<00:06:49.419> teammates<00:06:49.780> over<00:06:49.960> there
