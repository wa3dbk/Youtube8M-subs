all right here is the checkerboard
pattern<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.260> seven<00:02:37.530> by<00:02:37.650> seven<00:02:40.280> yeah<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
pattern of seven by seven yeah this

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.979 
pattern of seven by seven yeah this
looks<00:02:41.700> pretty<00:02:41.879> good<00:02:42.120> obviously<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:45.780> done

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
looks pretty good obviously if done

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.330 
looks pretty good obviously if done
check<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> bodes<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> fee<00:02:46.860> by<00:02:46.980> three<00:02:47.129> from

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
check it bodes on the fee by three from

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.970 
check it bodes on the fee by three from
more<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:48.780> guess<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.379> all<00:02:49.500> are<00:02:49.530> waiting

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
and as you can see the size comparison

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.080 
and as you can see the size comparison
as<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.440> see<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.829> pillowed<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.970> this

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
as you can see this is pillowed and this

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.809 
as you can see this is pillowed and this
is<00:03:09.239> cubic<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.069> sanction<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.459> 6<00:03:11.670> by<00:03:11.790> 6

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
is cubic this is the sanction of 6 by 6

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.089 
is cubic this is the sanction of 6 by 6
i'm<00:03:12.629> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> be<00:03:13.019> floating<00:03:13.379> modding<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
i'm going to be floating modding it

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.539 
i'm going to be floating modding it
right<00:03:14.250> now<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.670> mean<00:03:15.359> some<00:03:15.659> while<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.870> guess<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
right now I mean some while I guess the

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.490 
right now I mean some while I guess the
stickers<00:03:17.849> are<00:03:18.060> cubicle<00:03:18.810> half<00:03:18.959> price<00:03:19.230> for

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
stickers are cubicle half price for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.490 
stickers are cubicle half price for
those<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.950> were<00:03:20.549> just<00:03:20.730> curious<00:03:21.170> so<00:03:22.170> as<00:03:22.409> you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
those of you were just curious so as you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.149 
those of you were just curious so as you
can<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.889> this<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.940> pretty<00:03:24.269> much<00:03:24.359> what<00:03:25.159> the

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
can see this is pretty much what the

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.369 
can see this is pretty much what the
size<00:03:26.340> comparison<00:03:26.879> is<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.180> mean<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.659> can't<00:03:27.870> bc<00:03:28.079> i

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
size comparison is I mean you can't bc i

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.990 
size comparison is I mean you can't bc i
guess<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.920> same<00:03:29.190> only<00:03:29.609> thing<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
guess it's the same only thing is that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.849 
guess it's the same only thing is that
this<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.510> pillowed<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.139> looks<00:03:31.379> a<00:03:31.440> bit<00:03:31.560> pal

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
this is pillowed so it looks a bit pal

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.030 
this is pillowed so it looks a bit pal
geo<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.359> yeah<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:33.540> tiny<00:03:34.319> little<00:03:34.530> more<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
geo and yeah this tiny little more you

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.860 
geo and yeah this tiny little more you
logo<00:03:35.370> here<00:03:35.760> which<00:03:36.000> I'm<00:03:36.150> gonna<00:03:36.299> probably

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
logo here which I'm gonna probably

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.520 
logo here which I'm gonna probably
change<00:03:37.319> later<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.930> was<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.260> unboxing

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
change later so this was the unboxing
