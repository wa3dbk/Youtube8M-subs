 Hi everyone, have you noticed how 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040
 quickly ran the first half of the years and 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.349
 I hope you had a good time today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.080
 I would like to shoot a godfrey video for you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 people or gather with me but what 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 let's start more than a year for 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.000
 washing I use not ordinary water from 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 under the crane about the micellar it helps not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.070
 break my skin's imbalance such 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 I use lotion from clinics and here such 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.260
 vitamin cream from gabe brown 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.930
 after moisturizing the skin do not give 10-15 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.300
 minutes to soak up the cream 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.510
 completely and only then proceed to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.030
 make up 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.430
 my summer makeup is light enough and 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.309
 confident so that every girl can him 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.649
 repeat for a start I cut down the centuries and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 inner corner of the eye in order to 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 make the view more open and fresh 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.369

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.840
 also lighten the space above the lip and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.090
 slightly choose the chin area 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.940
 I will put the shadows on the bottom object and on 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.190
 crease of the upper eyelid to 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.860
