00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.429
 it's a bit like the law of series 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 spiral does not turn in the right direction 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.620
 for the runners of fdj.fr today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.230
 still in the Pyrenees they lived 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.600
 a terrible day in the image of their 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.300
 leader thibaut pinot thibaut pinot 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 cracked in the head and on the ground 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 obviously since he is losing today 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.840
 any illusion regarding the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 overall ranking thibaut pinot a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
 flunked but he did not give up 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.940
 reaction of teammates and his 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.239
 framing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 what about thibault 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 you finally feared what 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.829
 happened today it was all 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.770
 other batches either thibault it goes to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 something else or be there is still in 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 as a whole who malaise and ben 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.399
 wallace and he succeeds in his little 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.840
 unease and I understand it I think that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 his page would have been in the same state 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.170
 now they have to hang them 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.180
 individuals everything depends on the people we have 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 want a moment to want to pass 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.869
 to something else but hey we can not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 right now but what is certain this 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 what must be remembered from 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 thibaut know he's a great champion 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.030
 you must not forget it is a big 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.830
 champion never dies so and in addition 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 he is very young so I'm waiting for 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 see a little bit how it's going 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.310
 pass in the alps because 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.350
 physically he is at the top after the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.400
 worry is everything in his head it takes 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 leave a little bit of time 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.330
 what concerns him 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
 but I think he's going to make alps 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.799
 the height of my expectations all of the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.290
 less 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.750
 and also his own you know that a 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.509
 great champion who is taken like that of 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.520
 full whip by a counter-foot I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.540
 want to say it's true that especially 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.310
 that he does not have a big 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.409
 experience of the Tour de France and it's 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 the first big strokes of slats that 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.740
 who's going to take it full 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.810
 others it's part of the game that makes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 part of the sport and that we can not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.170
 not long quiet river the bike 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 especially when you're leader and so ben 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 here he is eating a little his 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.130
 black bread and we're here too for for 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.960
 to make him digest this black point and she 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.759
 wants him to appreciate the days that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 will come behind and it's true that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.000
 that's where we have to be strong 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
 the entire team for wearing 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 why who completely darkens and who 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.530
 go home because he's out of 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.030
 question versus full full of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.950
 things because he's here to learn 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020
 people 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.489
 it's not an old riders who 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.410
 allows up to being the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.230
 house he's especially not tired so 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.010
 that's also on the physical plane 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.430
 is intact 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.890
 it's moral and knows nothing we unfortunately go to 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.060
 put their skin and we're going to bounce 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.190
 on something else we will work 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.750
 differently but we will take care of him 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.970
 that's for sure we implemented together 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.560
 strategies of plans and that's it did not 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.420
 not work but if it had to 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.620
 always worked it would know that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.819
 it's the first thing and the second 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.140
 thing in the race we will work a 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.549
 little bit differently now and to 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.349
 depths of the ranking 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.630
 well, we'll burn your flingers 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.160
 maybe we're going but we're going to exist on 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.260
 the turn but we still try a 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
 nice test say we must be proud 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.230
 to be there and we're going to work 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.030
 the incense is to win a stage 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.260
 well it's true that for the team there 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.590
 it's hard to cash we were 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.209
 come with big ambitions 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.680
 that's it with two leaders means one for 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.569
 the sprints to for the mountain we already have 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.180
 lost 1 who gave up for sprints 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.000
 and the thibault who lives in the Pyrenees 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 very difficult he knows he took a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.860
 little slap yesterday he was really fucking 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.440
 disappointed and today I think he 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.760
 was expecting a lot of this day I 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.090
 think he has more crack in the head 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.190
 but the legs are there must if he 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.959
 remains focused I think it will make a 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.370
 good third week it's in these 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.109
 moments there have finally and not 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.090
 only in the race as the teammates 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.560
 are important yeah anyway 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.510
 that's what we told him here we are 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.829
 would aim in general so we're here to 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.709
 we want him we do not want him I want 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.230
 to say he's 23 years old to miss on a ride 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.850
 de France and it does not matter it's there 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.970
 will have others so here we support him 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.470
 we do not throw the stone and here we go 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.060
 now to struggle to refocus 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.620
 forget it a little bit there he'll go 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.560
 three four days it's going to be more 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.000
 quiet for him maybe goes 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.549
 there will be less media pressure 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 I hope for him that he will do one of 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.530
 fine arts between sir tonight and this morning 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.260
 you felt that could crack 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.319
 in the head last night they were twenty 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.560
 very morally afflicted 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.500
 that's a lot of trying to talk to him etc 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 but it's not easy he had 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.479
 really a lot of pressure and that's it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.039
 he 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.370
 he was very envied it's always 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.250
 difficult to fail the fact that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.990
 thibault could not bounce like 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.930
 as you all wished is what 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.419
 it forced you to change your 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.000
 plans during this stage or not 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.200
 after before I thought I did not think that 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.180
 thibault had planned today to 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.650
 make a big number taken to live more 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.150
 bounce back over the next few days after 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.919
 the general he made a cross on 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.570
 now it's going to be a step there 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.010
 had way to do it he knows he's going 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.530
 coach steps but good today 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.090
 way it was almost impossible for 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.090
 he was waiting for you it's a step 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.800
 also so difficult and where especially 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.840
 as important for leaders 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 today I know the corner well 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.750
 I knew it was going to be one of 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.590
 hardest of 2.2 this turn especially in 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.979
 end of first week 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.240
 so the school rehearsal did some 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.349
 big mergers but hey it's true 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.490
 I did not think the leaders at all 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.960
 were going to attack from so far 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.700
 when we saw the mess that had at 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.219
 after an hour and a half of running 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.810
 he did not even understand everything that was 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.969
 was going on because he would mark himself and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.620
 tackle we do not really know 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.990
 the interest of each team but good 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.280
 finally there was some big damage ben 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.719
 if it makes the race like that every 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.830
 days 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.830
 it was a tour of France very very hard
