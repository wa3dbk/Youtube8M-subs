00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 yes, today we have two again 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.269
 nice models from the company electronic 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.509
 and that are two or im 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.750
 scale one to ten from hpi and indeed 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.779
 this is the new ios 4 sport three 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.859
 chassis in two different variants 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.590
 model is now for a few days 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 only available we have so to speak 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.859
 get the first copies 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.630
 up here is a bmw m3 normal 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 Road vehicle and this one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.489
 below , subaru brz measure like something 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 it must be drifter that is a vip 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 8 cards and now we want our times 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 look like the new chassis like that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:59.449
 looks 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:01:04.010
 In any case, that clearly 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.189
 Packed remote control I believe 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:25.110
 well known standard 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:28.530
 sender chance rather times than clearly 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:35.299
 bmw to recognize gaelic typical bmw 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.579
 m3 e30 optics this 15 50 to design 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.299
 color is a matter of taste but so we 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.080
 want to vote in kokang but so 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.500
 much as i said a new development 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.750
 from hp have also seen 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 clear from completely encapsulated 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.729
 powertrain 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.560
 that means here is a wave 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.049
 Here is a gear in there where the scri 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.939
 Power is transmitted by the stock exchanges 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.909
 and then it's about such 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.349
 simple cv bone blind in front and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.670
 back to the wheels 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.459
 the special thing is really about it 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.019
 that from below in front of the pages of a 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 completely tight there is no dirt 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:23.010
 then he can not do anything 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:25.650
 perfect low-maintenance right thing too 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.709
 you always like to have one 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.209
 A bit dusty road or something worth it 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.850
 otherwise it is also very 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.980
 beginner friendly so my husband 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.220
 It also looks to the aspirations here 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.889
 then ultimately only catch with bullet 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.109
 otherwise they are on the ball heads 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:44.639
 Sometimes the crash comes or breaks 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.769
 nothing bends the jump easily 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.470
 Then you put them back on 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.170
 of course that is to the burden of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 Adjustments but completely honest 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.799
 the models are aimed at hobby 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.720
 beginner as is set with the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.400
 next want to have fun on board 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 Then I would say that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.389
 drive comfort except then solved 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.470
 motor just then a waterproof 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.630
 regulator 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.900
 Somewhere on it is a branch 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.140
 Of course, availability is not yes 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.760
 known no here in the small switch there 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.060
 can you still program something with 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.040
 a led house is on one another and here 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.690
 in the box his receiver in it too 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.250
 quite where waterproof here forward the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.250
 cable go in is still such a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.850
 shit I say that there too 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:44.250
 really no condensation dream comes 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:47.440
 and here comes the battery 6 cells 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.670
 battery also target group oriented for 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.390
 beginner second too 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.959
 millipairs exactly then fixed 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.360
 later with skeleton and typical 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.790
 Entry-level model provided with tabea 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.320
 connection is sufficient for the beginning 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.750
 completely out of exactly the same here 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.400
 the staff gets involved 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.650
 different connections depending on whether 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.270
 one wants to load Germany now or in the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.220
 Holiday los angeles systems 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.580
 because once again, to be completed we look 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.609
 yet again, have some of the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.970
 stink a bit of a tool a few 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.900
 replacement caro cling to additional stop 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.750
 still the transmitter batteries together with instructions 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.270
 So hp will not do it all around 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.370
 Carefree package 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.780
 which one in any case at the bmw yet 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.900
 Of course, the rims have to be mentioned 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.440
 a nice one in the fifty fifty two 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.640
 climb again for scale me with 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.520
 tire for the road so that he 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.160
 has a good grip and yes sees 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.240
 pretty faithfully fits out too 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.560
 I look good to the body 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.940
 perhaps again the other plane 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:20.390
 accepted 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:22.490
 among basically one too 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:42.050
 one must have interesting color design 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:44.980
 say again with an example then 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:49.970
 even more from the Asian region the 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:54.500
 The design of body cinema go in 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:58.100
 In this case schÃ¶nling here with this 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.350
 with this chrome deep bed optic with the 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.550
 Spoke rims also fits very good ones 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.310
 that's here now as I said this 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.560
 Postman with his plastic wheel 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.780
 on it so I have pretty little grip 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.580
 and also because relatively little 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.000
 engine power down now has in the 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.230
 get compared to the final drive 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.230
 can control you well 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.190
 otherwise not big 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.960
 but there are differences next to the decker 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.280
 you still have it apart now 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.730
 from what happens just like me brad 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.830
 Pitt with luck to bump, however 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.550
 no friction stampa like it too 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:45.520
 Sometimes I would still be installed 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.520
 say my little battle hits against it 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.560
 that's why 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:03.979
 German cars pass by and then look 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.749
 we will and of course report 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.749
 we make it like his
