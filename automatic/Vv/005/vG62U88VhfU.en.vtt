00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 which is to navigate anonymously or 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.850
 navigate as if you were inside 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.850
 us now I explain to you how 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.020
 my name is gabriel de gavà 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.779
 technologies in this video we will see 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.970
 how to use the top system is a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.860
 system that allows you to navigate through 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.000
 from several servers this helps you 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.430
 have a certain anonymity and apart 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.950
 to be able to navigate as if you were inside 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.960
 from the USA the only thing you have to do is 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.420
 enter this site if you want to focus 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.100
 in google and put store here you enter the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.710
 first the first web page that you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 appears and once you get in there you go to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 the section where it says download by a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 Once you download the program in the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.510
 installed will appear here 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 example a small onion and with that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 you execute him 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.039
 once you click here on the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.809
 Onion is what you're going to look like 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.089
 a little sign on the screen telling you that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 is going to start connecting to the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.989
 different servers and once 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 the process that can reach 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.090
 take about 15 seconds 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 there you are just going to open a browser that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.400
 it's called x browser for example here on 2 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.840
 browser is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.670
 a little program called firefox 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.370
 firefox has been modified by people 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 it's good now I 'm going to show you what 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.610
 you can do and the comparisons once 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 that the program that says here was loaded 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.060
 vitalia control panel and here it is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.740
 connected to the hector network 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.700
 directly you can put height and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.650
 go out and hide it good I'm going to 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.369
 show when you're browsing 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.860
 example and you put youtube pay videos are you going to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 enter here to this section and how can you 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
 see obviously it's completely empty 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.550
 you do not see anything but if that is exactly 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.540
 the same with thor you will see that here 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.940
 you have a pretty big list of 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.100
 paid channels and what's good 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.820
 obviously you can access material 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.160
 which is exclusive for usa 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.430
 obviously if we are interested in 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.750
 example the first channel that we see here 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.810
 which is called 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.960
 you are going to see that it costs something of five 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.900
 dollars per month and you can access everything 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.880
 the material that they give you 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.760
 obviously you get 14 days to try it 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200
 and if you like it you continue and if there is no 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.120
 problems what has obviously good 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 that when they put any kind of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.950
 advertising and you can access content 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.670
 exclusive then something else for example 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.709
 if we put surveillance systems here 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.130
 surveillance system let's see three 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.810
 propaganda usually from the USA and that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.330
 it would be all for what this serves you 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.580
 obviously this helps if you are a 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.250
 person who advertises on google 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.500
 for example google adwords and vos querés 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.650
 see what is advertised in the USA 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.989
 as one is not in the usa obviously that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.420
 advertising that one put together is not going to see 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.700
 then with this system you will be able to 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.730
 solve that for example here I put 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.489
 exactly the same be by lnd system and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.430
 here we can see three warnings and apart 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.519
 let's see ads as we can see here 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.290
 with photos obviously this system is 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.230
 implement state again 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.150
 usa nothing more bull and then custom 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.430
 let time go by at least 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.019
 today in 2013 they will be 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.180
 implementing for the rest of the world 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.400
 but good here you give an idea how it is 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.950
 google back in the usa that is totally 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.159
 different in some aspects 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.379
 this helps you to be able to even see the 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.599
 rest of the competition and the things that 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.569
 you can get to do after 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.620
 we will quickly enter in July is 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.629
 the last site we're going to see for today 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.030
 which is obviously dedicated to 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.970
 North America as we can see here says 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 in English that he is sorry or not 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.829
 we can not see any of the videos 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.530
 because it's only for us, but if 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.980
 we do exactly the same inside the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.629
 tor 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.419
 obviously another thing that I want to clarify 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.940
 how this system goes through several 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.639
 servers will not be as fast as 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.940
 that if you navigate is directly with 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.250
 your system and sometimes you will ask for this 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.770
 type of checkup but the only thing you have 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.449
 what to do is complete it and continue without 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 any kind of problem ready 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.039
 we entered in July and now you will see that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.900
 he is not going to tell us the same poster that you 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.999
 we showed previously good as 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.129
 we can see obviously we already enter 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:44.129
 July did not throw any kind of message 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.199
 of error or anything now other thing that you 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.830
 I'm going to show if we go into what is my 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:52.680
 Haitian we can see that the ip that gave us 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.909
 here in this case was from toronto bone 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.490
 Canada does not matter because Canada and the USA 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.379
 normally they do not have problems for 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.080
 be able to access this type of services 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.300
 if they do not put any kind of obstacles but 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.599
 good depends on the server that you 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.949
 conectes depends on the country where you are 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.749
 obviously it will give you every time you 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.539
 you connect with this type of system 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.729
 to connect to a different server 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.409
 then obviously the ip is always going to 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.060
 be different but good can you get 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.120
 to serve for this kind of thing if you 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.979
 you have to do tests or you want to see 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.279
 content obviously that in your country there 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.319
 it's possible it's a good way to power 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.749
 accessing this program is totally 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.399
 free and you will not have any kind of 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.990
 inconvenient to install it in 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.730
 any computer 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.080
 have any questions or have you 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.150
 Comment you have, you can do it 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.340

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.740
