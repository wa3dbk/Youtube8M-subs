mod<00:00:42.739> previews<00:00:43.550> I'm<00:00:44.200> going<00:00:45.200> to<00:00:45.320> do<00:00:45.530> like<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
mod previews I'm going to do like the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.369 
mod previews I'm going to do like the
normal<00:00:46.070> vanilla<00:00:46.969> through<00:00:47.690> version<00:00:48.020> 1<00:00:48.200> and

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
normal vanilla through version 1 and

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.470 
normal vanilla through version 1 and
then<00:00:48.559> version<00:00:48.920> 2<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.520> mod<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:50.180> you<00:00:50.270> can<00:00:50.360> see

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
then version 2 of the mod so you can see

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.240 
then version 2 of the mod so you can see
the<00:00:50.570> difference<00:00:50.840> between<00:00:50.899> all<00:00:51.230> them<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.160> it's

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
the difference between all them so it's

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.740 
the difference between all them so it's
not<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.399> case<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.790> sitting<00:00:53.390> back<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
not the case of sitting back and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:10.110 
not the case of sitting back and
enjoying<00:00:53.930> basically

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:20.220

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560
