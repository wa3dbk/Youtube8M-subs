00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
general comment on how it runs so climb

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.970 
general comment on how it runs so climb
on<00:00:14.519> started<00:00:15.210> up<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:16.170> seems<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.470> start<00:00:16.740> each

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
on started up it seems to start each

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.470 
on started up it seems to start each
time<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.310> think<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> battery<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.029> probably

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
time I think the battery is probably

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.710 
time I think the battery is probably
okay<00:00:18.900> over<00:00:19.789> my<00:00:20.789> left<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.119> Sean<00:00:21.300> who's<00:00:21.539> not

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
okay over my left for Sean who's not

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.890 
okay over my left for Sean who's not
using<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> oil<00:00:24.300> light<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
using it so I got on the oil light and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.390 
using it so I got on the oil light and
the<00:00:24.990> new<00:00:25.109> try<00:00:25.320> comes<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.010> turn<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the new try comes on there you turn the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.350 
the new try comes on there you turn the
ignition<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:29.119> all<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:32.360> moving

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
ignition on all right let's just moving

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.930 
ignition on all right let's just moving
us<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.750> feels

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.180 

it's<00:00:40.360> been<00:00:41.350> sitting<00:00:41.560> around<00:00:41.710> for<00:00:41.980> quite<00:00:42.130> a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
it's been sitting around for quite a

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.930 
it's been sitting around for quite a
long<00:00:42.370> time

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
long time

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.380 
long time
I<00:00:44.190> suspect<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.280> fuel<00:00:45.550> in<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.910> bike<00:00:46.180> is

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
I suspect the fuel in this bike is

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.030 
I suspect the fuel in this bike is
probably<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.930> couple<00:00:47.290> of<00:00:47.440> three<00:00:47.650> years<00:00:47.890> old

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
probably a couple of three years old

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.549 
probably a couple of three years old
maybe<00:00:48.280> something<00:00:48.730> like<00:00:48.880> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
maybe something like that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.290 
maybe something like that
it's<00:00:50.559> misfiring<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.309> little<00:00:51.700> but<00:00:51.970> generally

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
it's misfiring a little but generally

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.960 
it's misfiring a little but generally
speaking<00:00:52.330> it's<00:00:52.840> on<00:00:52.930> four<00:00:53.200> cylinders<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.730> bike

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
speaking it's on four cylinders the bike

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.430 
speaking it's on four cylinders the bike
feels<00:00:55.210> nice<00:00:55.450> and<00:00:55.690> straight<00:00:56.110> if<00:00:56.290> I<00:00:56.350> think

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
feels nice and straight if I think

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.710 
feels nice and straight if I think
myself<00:00:56.680> handlebars<00:00:57.400> there<00:00:58.890> I<00:01:00.480> could<00:01:01.480> feel<00:01:01.510> all

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
myself handlebars there I could feel all

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.240 
myself handlebars there I could feel all
the<00:01:01.780> gears<00:01:02.199> are<00:01:02.350> there<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.739> no<00:01:02.890> transmission

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the gears are there is no transmission

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.650 
the gears are there is no transmission
noises<00:01:03.850> or<00:01:03.940> anything<00:01:04.119> out<00:01:04.300> there<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.570> be

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
noises or anything out there to be

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.920 
noises or anything out there to be
concerned<00:01:05.110> about<00:01:06.300> have<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> bit<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.630> a<00:01:07.720> feel<00:01:07.900> of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
concerned about have a bit of a feel of

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
concerned about have a bit of a feel of
the<00:01:08.110> brakes<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.740> just<00:01:09.220> labeled<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.640> front<00:01:09.910> brake

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the brakes I just labeled a front brake

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.340 
the brakes I just labeled a front brake
the<00:01:13.030> front<00:01:13.060> discs<00:01:13.600> were<00:01:13.690> nice<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:13.899> flat<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the front discs were nice and flat and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.820 
the front discs were nice and flat and
the<00:01:14.440> brake<00:01:14.619> feels<00:01:14.860> reasonably<00:01:15.280> powerful

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the brake feels reasonably powerful

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.300 
the brake feels reasonably powerful
saying<00:01:17.830> for<00:01:18.039> the<00:01:18.100> back<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.950> same<00:01:21.130> goes

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
saying for the back and the same goes

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.700 
saying for the back and the same goes
for<00:01:21.369> about<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.820> rear<00:01:22.000> disc<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.500> was<00:01:23.619> as

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
for about the rear disc it was as

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.710 
for about the rear disc it was as
powerful<00:01:23.920> as<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.250> you<00:01:24.430> do<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.330> dis<00:01:25.509> was

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
powerful as this you do and the dis was

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:35.179 
powerful as this you do and the dis was
nice<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.050> flat<00:01:26.229> as<00:01:26.440> well

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.100 

generally<00:01:36.060> speaking<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.570> bike<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
generally speaking the bike kind of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
generally speaking the bike kind of
feels<00:01:37.399> pretty<00:01:38.399> good<00:01:38.640> apart<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> fighters

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
feels pretty good apart the fighters

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.010 
feels pretty good apart the fighters
coming<00:01:39.509> firmer<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.880> heads<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
coming firmer and heads of them but I

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
coming firmer and heads of them but I
just<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.380> that's<00:01:44.240> sitting<00:01:45.240> around<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
just think that's sitting around and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.120 
just think that's sitting around and
he's<00:01:45.720> probably<00:01:45.869> fine<00:01:46.170> putting<00:01:46.500> new<00:01:46.649> fuel<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
he's probably fine putting new fuel in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:57.749 
he's probably fine putting new fuel in
it<00:01:49.009> I'd<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> first<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> do

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.219 

yeah<00:01:58.759> generally<00:01:59.359> speaking<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.869> think<00:01:59.899> it's<00:02:00.140> not

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
yeah generally speaking I think it's not

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.210 
yeah generally speaking I think it's not
a<00:02:00.289> bad<00:02:00.469> box<00:02:00.770> anyway<00:02:01.189> that's<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.819> test<00:02:01.999> them
