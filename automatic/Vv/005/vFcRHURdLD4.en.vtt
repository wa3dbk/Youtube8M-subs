 use related but here as you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.510
 broke down a tree or climbed otherwise 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.740
 nothing will turn out to dry 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.910
 immediately before use 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.910
 flow it dried up and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.430
 I will come already consumption that is do not wash

 do not wet the fruit 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.240
 apricot only dry it as ripped off

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.840
 wood without visible traces of decay and 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.060
 damage as they instead 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.940
 dry just spoil spoil 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.120
 the fruits lying next to begin must 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.670
 in the morning and sunny day 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.110
 hot weather if it is overcast 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.130
 don't even start nothing at you 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.890
 it will work out because the fruits we will 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.140
 dry in the sun means 1 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:18.100
 separate the apricots and here are the bones and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.780
 lay out on a tray or surface 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.570
 That way it is better if it will 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 metal or plastic wood does not fit 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.530
 because it gives off bad heat to us 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.450
 it is necessary that go heated this 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.119
 this contributed to the fastest 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.119
 drying up the fruits of the costa as you laid out 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.539
 apricot on a tray expose them 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.259
 sunny place where you have the whole sun 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.259
 a day is desirable this roof 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.909
 home garage shed if not then on 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.909
 balcony here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 panzer fruits dry out completely 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.789
 dehydrated then maybe more 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 days you yourself must look and appreciate 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.709
 they must be dry resilient and not not 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 they should have no moisture on 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.730
 night the fruits must be brought more precisely no longer 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.950
 under the carcass otherwise the race will ruin you all 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.120
 I mean you do things in the morning 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 put in the room 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.129
 and after drying, drying must be placed 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.260
 jar 1 2 3 ready 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.810
 cover with gapon cover put on two 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.590
 day freezer this is done in order 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:49.390
 that all microorganisms that were on 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.519
 the fruits died and did not spoil the product 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.439
 for after you finish it 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.379
 preparations after two days how much 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.189
 in the freezer you can also blame them 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.650
 same banks but no longer afraid for what with 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.260
 something happens to them drying can 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.950
 stored up to two to five years nothing 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.950
 will happen
