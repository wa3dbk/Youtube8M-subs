of<00:01:27.689> scoring<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.939> every<00:01:29.939> day<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> feels

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
of scoring I think so every day it feels

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
of scoring I think so every day it feels
better<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.840> better<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.140> hopefully<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.430> have

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
better and better so hopefully we have

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
better and better so hopefully we have
two<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.880> practices<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> think<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.110> our<00:01:34.920> first

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159

two more practices I think for our first
game<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.610> hopefully<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.689> ready<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> go
