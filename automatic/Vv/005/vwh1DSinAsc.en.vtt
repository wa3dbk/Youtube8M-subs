press really hard on this pump because
you<00:02:10.940> only<00:02:11.120> need<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.570> little<00:02:11.630> amount<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.470> does<00:02:13.070> a

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
you only need a little amount it does a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.140 
you only need a little amount it does a
lot<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.460> coverage<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.900> then<00:02:15.590> when<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.150> open

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
lot of coverage and then when you open

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.110 
lot of coverage and then when you open
up<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.510> cap<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.140> foundation<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.880> get<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
up the cap of this foundation you get a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.480 
up the cap of this foundation you get a
little<00:02:20.540> tiny<00:02:20.750> mirror<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.830> guess<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.310> would

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
little tiny mirror so I guess this would

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.150 
little tiny mirror so I guess this would
be<00:02:22.610> portable<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.240> guess<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.010> would

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
be portable I guess and then you would

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.190 
be portable I guess and then you would
get<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.460> matching<00:02:25.910> concealer<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.930> don't

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
get the matching concealer so you don't

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.830 
get the matching concealer so you don't
