00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:27.600
 YOU ARE FOR ME WHAT POETRY WANTS TO SAY 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:01:14.790
 WORDS AND THE SONG THAT ALWAYS HEARS MY HEART 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.380
 I CAN NOT ESCAPE UNTIL THE AIR I BREATHE TALKS TO ME 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:41.960
 AND I DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO FEEL THIS ... IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:02:34.099
 I PROMISE MY LOVE TO GIVE YOU WHAT I HAVE AND WHAT I AM 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:47.140
 AND I WANT TO CONFESS BEFORE THIS ALTAR THAT I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
