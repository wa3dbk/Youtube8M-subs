00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.339 
know I put in one more video bit bit
cramped<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.449> I'd<00:00:27.660> rather<00:00:27.840> discuss<00:00:28.019> them

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
cramped so I'd rather discuss them

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.540 
cramped so I'd rather discuss them
separately<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.830> put<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.279> video

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
location i can think of and giving my

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.959 
location i can think of and giving my
opinion<00:00:36.180> /<00:00:37.050> force<00:00:37.469> on<00:00:37.680> them<00:00:37.829> again<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
opinion / force on them again so the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
opinion / force on them again so the
first<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.750> dancy<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> reflection<00:00:40.890> cave

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
first one for dancy is reflection cave

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
first one for dancy is reflection cave
the<00:00:41.370> ad<00:00:41.610> cos<00:00:41.910> I'd<00:00:42.030> spot<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.230> reflection

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
the ad cos I'd spot now in reflection

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
the ad cos I'd spot now in reflection

times in the evening etc um and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
times in the evening etc um and
basically<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.730> air<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.090> get<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.329> from

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
basically what the air you get it from

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.850 
basically what the air you get it from
is<00:00:51.600> basically<00:00:51.960> there's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> shaft<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> light

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
is basically there's a shaft of light

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.400 
is basically there's a shaft of light
coming<00:00:53.280> down<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.960> that's<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> there's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
coming down and that's it there's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.290 
coming down and that's it there's
nothing<00:00:55.800> else<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> shaft<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
nothing else there's just a shaft of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
nothing else there's just a shaft of
light<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.719> obviously<00:00:58.410> their<00:00:58.559> acolytes<00:00:58.890> then

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
light and obviously their acolytes then

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
light and obviously their acolytes then
behind<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.850> that's<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.239> isn't<00:01:00.480> nothing

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
behind it but that's it isn't nothing

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
behind it but that's it isn't nothing
else<00:01:01.140> through<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.350> area<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
else through the area at all and it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.650 
else through the area at all and it's
actually<00:01:02.460> quite<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> way<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually quite out of the way so I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
actually quite out of the way so I
thought<00:01:03.840> towards<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> side<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
thought towards the side you know not in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.640 
thought towards the side you know not in
the<00:01:05.909> middle<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> cave<00:01:06.390> whatever<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.500> my

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the middle of the cave whatever so my

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.260 
the middle of the cave whatever so my
thinking<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.580> reflection<00:01:09.090> here

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
thinking is if it was reflection here

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.000 
thinking is if it was reflection here
for<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> allagas<00:01:09.900> aight<00:01:10.049> spot<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.710> might<00:01:10.860> get

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
for the allagas aight spot you might get

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190 
for the allagas aight spot you might get
an<00:01:11.100> event<00:01:11.340> item<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.909> example<00:01:12.360> since<00:01:13.020> it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
an event item for example since it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
an event item for example since it's
Diane<00:01:13.439> teen<00:01:13.650> dance<00:01:13.920> he's<00:01:14.070> based<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.430> diamond

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
Diane teen dance he's based on a diamond

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.789 
Diane teen dance he's based on a diamond
it<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.390> diamonds<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> might<00:01:16.259> get<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it could be a diamonds you might get you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.280 
it could be a diamonds you might get you
in<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> diamond<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.390> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
in a diamond and then that you know so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.830 
in a diamond and then that you know so
launches<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> event<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.189> guess<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.580> say

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
launches the event I guess you could say

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.570 
launches the event I guess you could say
when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.470> alco<00:01:22.830> site<00:01:22.979> spot<00:01:23.310> my

something like that there's so many

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.100 
something like that there's so many

different possibilities to that sort of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.450 
different possibilities to that sort of
you<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.799> happen<00:01:40.979> whether<00:01:41.250> could

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so and I and see where the carvings

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
so and I and see where the carvings
could<00:01:43.229> come<00:01:43.350> together<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> form<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.490> or

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
could come together to form them or

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
could come together to form them or
something<00:01:45.479> along<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.930> lines<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.829> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
anywhere on refraction cave so it could

every person that would be interesting

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.420 
every person that would be interesting
like<00:02:42.570> what<00:02:42.810> doesn't<00:02:43.380> always<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> be<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
like what doesn't always have to be the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.210 
like what doesn't always have to be the
same<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.170> know<00:02:46.170> same<00:02:46.500> location<00:02:46.920> every<00:02:47.070> time

same you know same location every time

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.380 
same you know same location every time
for<00:02:47.310> every<00:02:47.400> single<00:02:47.700> person<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.180> comes<00:02:48.300> like

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
for every single person so it comes like

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.390 
for every single person so it comes like
a<00:02:48.450> randomly<00:02:48.840> generated<00:02:48.870> location<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:50.160> gets<00:02:50.340> to

a randomly generated location it gets to

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.640 
a randomly generated location it gets to
the<00:02:50.490> run<00:02:50.670> around<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.290> reflection<00:02:52.290> cave<00:02:52.470> to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
jewels and diamonds and start such diet

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220 
jewels and diamonds and start such diet
is<00:03:47.460> based<00:03:47.490> on<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.910> diamond<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.450> stuff<00:03:49.080> like

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
is based on a diamond and stuff like

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.850 
is based on a diamond and stuff like
that<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> very<00:03:50.280> big<00:03:50.760> possibility<00:03:51.000> that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
that so it's a very big possibility that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.170 
that so it's a very big possibility that
well<00:03:52.860> not<00:03:53.100> very<00:03:53.130> pretty<00:03:53.430> as<00:03:53.640> possible<00:03:53.670> spit

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
well not very pretty as possible spit

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.610 
well not very pretty as possible spit
possibility<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.110> a<00:03:55.440> possibility

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
possibility but it's a possibility

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.440 
possibility but it's a possibility

nonetheless that you know they could

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.120 
nonetheless that you know they could
link<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.750> there<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.590> could<00:03:58.770> again<00:03:58.980> how<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
link it there so you could again how a

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.860 
link it there so you could again how a

bit<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.880> cave<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.300> think<00:04:28.510> if<00:04:28.660> they'll

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
bit of the cave but I think if they'll

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.180 
bit of the cave but I think if they'll
if<00:04:29.020> don<00:04:29.290> t<00:04:29.440> do<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.800> end<00:04:29.949> up<00:04:30.070> in

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
if don t do that for end up in

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.409 
if don t do that for end up in
glittering<00:04:30.490> cave<00:04:30.699> it<00:04:30.820> would<00:04:30.910> be<00:04:31.000> in<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.180> first

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
glittering cave it would be in the first

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.600 
glittering cave it would be in the first
section<00:04:31.720> like<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.710> dark<00:04:32.979> tunnels<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.460> such

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
section like the dark tunnels and such

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.939

not<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.090> second<00:04:34.389> section<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.380> that's<00:04:35.620> sort<00:04:35.860> of

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
not the second section so that's sort of

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.580 
not the second section so that's sort of
another<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.610> those<00:04:36.699> options<00:04:37.060> then<00:04:38.050> as<00:04:38.350> I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
another of those options then as I

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.260 
another of those options then as I
mentioned<00:04:38.919> sort<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.280> before<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.850> improves

you speak to him and the train comes and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.589 
you speak to him and the train comes and
takes<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:36.910> deep<00:05:37.060> into<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.419> mountains

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
takes you deep into the mountains

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.300 
takes you deep into the mountains
because<00:05:38.410> house<00:05:38.560> obviously<00:05:38.710> where<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.010> sort<00:05:39.280> of

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
because house obviously where I sort of

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.460 
because house obviously where I sort of
positioned<00:05:40.090> it<00:05:40.780> takes<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.080> deep<00:05:41.229> into<00:05:41.380> the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
positioned it takes you deep into the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.500 
positioned it takes you deep into the
mountains<00:05:41.590> where<00:05:42.400> mu<00:05:42.700> diancie<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.240> hidden

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
mountains where mu diancie is hidden

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.480 
mountains where mu diancie is hidden
away<00:05:43.570> in<00:05:43.870> very<00:05:44.710> deep<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.130> mountains

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
away in very deep in the mountains

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.120 
away in very deep in the mountains
because<00:05:46.180> obviously<00:05:46.650> diamonds<00:05:47.650> are<00:05:47.770> created<00:05:48.070> I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
because obviously diamonds are created I

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.909 
because obviously diamonds are created I
pressure<00:05:48.430> over<00:05:49.419> millions<00:05:49.810> of<00:05:49.840> years<00:05:49.930> so

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
pressure over millions of years so

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.490 
pressure over millions of years so
obviously<00:05:51.419> that<00:05:52.419> would<00:05:52.570> link<00:05:52.810> in<00:05:53.020> being<00:05:53.289> deep

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
obviously that would link in being deep

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.830 
obviously that would link in being deep
in<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.710> mountains<00:05:54.039> for<00:05:54.070> example<00:05:54.840> then

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
in the mountains for example then

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.930 
in the mountains for example then
there's<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.080> lumiose<00:05:56.410> or<00:05:56.740> collude<00:05:57.130> t/a<00:05:57.580> TM

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
there's the lumiose or collude t/a TM

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.850 
there's the lumiose or collude t/a TM
via<00:05:58.389> not<00:05:58.570> not<00:05:59.080> even<00:05:59.110> ashore<00:05:59.440> last<00:05:59.590> night<00:05:59.770> as

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
via not not even ashore last night as

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.469 
via not not even ashore last night as
well<00:05:59.979> but<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.669> could<00:06:00.820> also<00:06:00.970> lead<00:06:01.210> you<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:01.389> the

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
well but that could also lead you to the

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.029 
well but that could also lead you to the
mountains<00:06:01.870> it's<00:06:02.320> another<00:06:02.530> option<00:06:02.919> but<00:06:03.010> i

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
mountains it's another option but i

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:04.260 
mountains it's another option but i
think<00:06:03.220> the<00:06:03.280> crew<00:06:03.460> away<00:06:03.610> town<00:06:03.820> train<00:06:04.120> will<00:06:04.240> be

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
think the crew away town train will be

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.240 
think the crew away town train will be

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
more likely if they were to go that

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.939 
more likely if they were to go that
route<00:06:06.430> and<00:06:06.699> if<00:06:07.570> they<00:06:07.780> did<00:06:08.530> take<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.860> the

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
route and if they did take you to the

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.710 
route and if they did take you to the
mountains<00:06:09.310> indeed<00:06:09.610> then<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.240> would<00:06:10.270> link<00:06:10.510> in

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
mountains indeed then that would link in

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.960 
mountains indeed then that would link in
with<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:11.080> lumiose<00:06:11.530> press<00:06:11.979> editor<00:06:12.550> theory

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.960 
who knows then the final generic one
I've<00:06:23.080> got<00:06:23.260> here<00:06:23.380> is<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.889> power<00:06:24.099> plant<00:06:24.310> there

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
I've got here is the power plant there

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.990 
I've got here is the power plant there
are<00:06:25.180> four<00:06:25.660> extra<00:06:26.080> power<00:06:26.260> plants<00:06:26.620> as<00:06:26.740> well<00:06:26.800> as

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
are four extra power plants as well as

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.060 
are four extra power plants as well as
the<00:06:28.720> power<00:06:28.930> plant<00:06:29.110> you<00:06:29.320> do<00:06:29.410> in<00:06:29.530> the<00:06:29.620> storyline

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
the power plant you do in the storyline

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.500 
the power plant you do in the storyline
there<00:06:30.460> are<00:06:30.580> four<00:06:30.790> I've<00:06:30.940> ones<00:06:31.180> and<00:06:31.420> with

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
there are four I've ones and with

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.420 
there are four I've ones and with
mentioning<00:06:32.020> these<00:06:32.110> in<00:06:32.350> loadable<00:06:32.890> videos<00:06:33.250> in

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
mentioning these in loadable videos in

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.310 
mentioning these in loadable videos in
the<00:06:33.520> future<00:06:33.550> there<00:06:34.540> are<00:06:34.570> four<00:06:34.810> free<00:06:35.110> ones

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
the future there are four free ones

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.770 
the future there are four free ones
maybe<00:06:35.920> it's<00:06:36.400> in<00:06:36.610> one<00:06:36.730> of<00:06:36.760> them<00:06:36.970> maybe<00:06:37.480> you<00:06:37.660> know

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
maybe it's in one of them maybe you know

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.090 
maybe it's in one of them maybe you know
there's<00:06:37.990> an<00:06:38.050> event<00:06:38.230> for<00:06:38.440> each<00:06:38.530> power<00:06:38.830> plant

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
there's an event for each power plant

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.400 
there's an event for each power plant
that<00:06:39.310> could<00:06:39.850> be<00:06:39.970> as<00:06:40.090> a<00:06:40.180> possibility<00:06:40.480> it<00:06:41.140> could

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
that could be as a possibility it could

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.520 
that could be as a possibility it could
be<00:06:41.770> indeed<00:06:42.190> so<00:06:43.110> which<00:06:44.110> one<00:06:44.290> would<00:06:44.380> it<00:06:44.440> be

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
be indeed so which one would it be

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.110 
be indeed so which one would it be
there's<00:06:44.830> four<00:06:45.250> different<00:06:45.280> ones<00:06:45.730> that<00:06:45.910> solve<00:06:46.060> a

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
there's four different ones that solve a

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.210 
there's four different ones that solve a
futuristic-looking<00:06:46.720> one<00:06:47.200> there's<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.860> wind

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
futuristic-looking one there's a wind

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.370 
futuristic-looking one there's a wind
warm<00:06:48.520> with<00:06:48.670> turbines<00:06:49.120> there's<00:06:49.450> a<00:06:49.600> woman<00:06:50.020> lava

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
warm with turbines there's a woman lava

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.690 
warm with turbines there's a woman lava
and<00:06:50.800> then<00:06:50.920> there's<00:06:51.100> one<00:06:51.250> we<00:06:51.340> just<00:06:51.520> sort<00:06:51.670> of

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
and then there's one we just sort of

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.360 
and then there's one we just sort of
steam<00:06:52.230> it<00:06:53.230> could<00:06:53.470> really<00:06:53.680> be<00:06:53.800> an<00:06:53.950> it<00:06:54.130> could<00:06:54.280> be

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
steam it could really be an it could be

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.760 
steam it could really be an it could be
in<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.520> magma<00:06:54.760> one<00:06:54.910> the<00:06:55.030> larvae<00:06:55.330> warm<00:06:55.450> because

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
in the magma one the larvae warm because

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.620 
in the magma one the larvae warm because
again<00:06:56.770> pressure<00:06:57.130> heat<00:06:57.490> etc<00:06:57.760> could<00:06:58.330> link<00:06:58.510> to

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
again pressure heat etc could link to

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.310 
again pressure heat etc could link to
that<00:06:58.660> it<00:06:59.380> could<00:06:59.620> also<00:06:59.770> be<00:06:59.920> in<00:07:00.400> the<00:07:01.320> precious

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
that it could also be in the precious

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.680 
that it could also be in the precious
the<00:07:02.650> sea<00:07:02.950> Wonka<00:07:03.340> steam<00:07:03.669> might<00:07:03.970> signify<00:07:04.450> their

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
the sea Wonka steam might signify their

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.840 
the sea Wonka steam might signify their
being<00:07:04.870> pressure<00:07:05.169> in<00:07:05.410> the<00:07:05.500> rocks<00:07:05.710> and<00:07:06.580> stuff

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
being pressure in the rocks and stuff

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.490 
being pressure in the rocks and stuff
like<00:07:06.940> that<00:07:07.000> the<00:07:07.360> wind<00:07:07.540> was<00:07:07.720> less<00:07:08.020> likely<00:07:08.380> and

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
like that the wind was less likely and

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.960 
like that the wind was less likely and
the<00:07:08.560> futuristic<00:07:09.010> once<00:07:09.160> again<00:07:09.460> it<00:07:09.820> is<00:07:09.940> a

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
the futuristic once again it is a

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.909 
the futuristic once again it is a
possibility<00:07:10.180> there<00:07:10.720> because<00:07:10.960> of<00:07:11.080> the<00:07:11.169> shiny

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
possibility there because of the shiny

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.680 
possibility there because of the shiny
futuristic<00:07:12.700> stuff<00:07:12.910> a<00:07:13.120> sort<00:07:13.300> of<00:07:13.330> might<00:07:13.510> link

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
futuristic stuff a sort of might link

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.300 
futuristic stuff a sort of might link
with<00:07:13.840> a<00:07:13.870> crystal<00:07:14.110> maybe<00:07:14.740> the<00:07:14.919> crystal<00:07:15.220> could

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
with a crystal maybe the crystal could

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.070 
with a crystal maybe the crystal could
be<00:07:15.430> used<00:07:15.610> to<00:07:15.730> do<00:07:16.120> something<00:07:16.450> you<00:07:16.600> know<00:07:16.690> create

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
be used to do something you know create

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.570 
be used to do something you know create
power<00:07:17.290> or<00:07:17.590> something<00:07:17.890> i<00:07:17.950> and<00:07:18.160> the<00:07:18.220> team<00:07:18.250> flare

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
power or something i and the team flare

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.970 
power or something i and the team flare
wants<00:07:19.240> to<00:07:19.390> come<00:07:19.990> back<00:07:20.020> and<00:07:20.380> use<00:07:20.530> that<00:07:20.560> power<00:07:20.830> to

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
wants to come back and use that power to

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.440 
wants to come back and use that power to
destroy<00:07:21.220> the<00:07:21.400> region<00:07:21.669> again<00:07:21.880> it's<00:07:22.360> a

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
destroy the region again it's a

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.200 
destroy the region again it's a
possibility<00:07:22.750> there<00:07:23.140> again<00:07:23.880> okay<00:07:24.880> guys<00:07:25.000> so<00:07:25.180> I

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
possibility there again okay guys so I

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.580 
possibility there again okay guys so I
think<00:07:25.270> that's<00:07:25.510> all<00:07:25.750> different<00:07:26.169> theories<00:07:26.470> and

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
think that's all different theories and

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.670 
think that's all different theories and
locations<00:07:27.130> I<00:07:27.310> have<00:07:27.910> for<00:07:28.600> Diane<00:07:29.200> see<00:07:29.470> there's

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680
