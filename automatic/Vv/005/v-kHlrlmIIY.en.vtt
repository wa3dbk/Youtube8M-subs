hello today I'm going to show you how to
draw<00:00:04.049> three<00:00:04.589> different<00:00:05.190> triangles<00:00:05.910> let's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
draw three different triangles let's

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.480 
draw three different triangles let's
make<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> new<00:00:07.470> document<00:00:07.680> go<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.490> file<00:00:09.120> new<00:00:09.469> and
