00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
24 you're going to need to do a lot of

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.700 
24 you're going to need to do a lot of
hardening<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:56.750> get<00:01:56.870> your<00:01:56.990> wire<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.470> be<00:01:57.560> nice

here and the end of my wire is kind of

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.850 
here and the end of my wire is kind of
mangled<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.140> I'm<00:02:06.200> just<00:02:06.380> going<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.590> cut<00:02:06.740> that

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860

insert<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> end<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.580> our<00:02:20.670> wire<00:02:20.910> through<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
insert the end of our wire through the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.850 
insert the end of our wire through the
little<00:02:22.650> hole<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.640> there's<00:02:23.820> only<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.210> hole<00:02:24.860> on

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
little hole and there's only one hole on

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.010 
little hole and there's only one hole on
this<00:02:26.100> one<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:26.610> pretty<00:02:26.730> easy<00:02:26.880> I'm<00:02:27.870> going

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
this one so it's pretty easy I'm going

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.980 
this one so it's pretty easy I'm going
to<00:02:28.110> bend<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> down<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.360> hold<00:02:30.360> on<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.660> on<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
to bend it down and hold on to it on the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.040 
to bend it down and hold on to it on the
back<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:32.640> all<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.150> do<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.450> follow<00:02:33.720> along

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
back and now all you do is follow along

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.600 
back and now all you do is follow along
the<00:02:34.230> instructions<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.950> going<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.280> tell<00:02:35.460> you

the instructions it's going to tell you
what<00:02:36.210> path<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.870> wrap<00:02:37.350> your<00:02:37.620> wire<00:02:37.830> around

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
what path to what wrap your wire around

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.750 
what path to what wrap your wire around
and<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.750> exactly<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.490> order

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
and you just do it exactly in the order

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.850 
and you just do it exactly in the order
that<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.970> says<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.140> particular<00:02:43.710> one

edges of the tip of the wire and be

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.700 
edges of the tip of the wire and be
careful<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.880> don't<00:05:15.260> scratch<00:05:16.260> the<00:05:16.500> rest

because it will scratch off the finish

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.780 
because it will scratch off the finish
just<00:05:21.030> right<00:05:21.180> at<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.390> tip<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.870> can<00:05:22.790> just

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
kind of go all the way around the edges

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.810

way around a few times it shouldn't take

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.830
