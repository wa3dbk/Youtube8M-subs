00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 That's the way it is, people, I'm Rodrigo. 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 after some time 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.320
 I'm here my second video with the games 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.059
 cool for the same and if android in which i 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 Indicate apps are good 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.670
 although they are less well known than the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.400
 I'm going to speak today about the bonexo 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.820
 retro anders and boson next 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.820
 here we go 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.559
 in dolls is a title in the shura style 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.660
 map or in the popular ship game that 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.489
 brings as a great differential the fact only 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.559
 have an enemy 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.680
 that same the main character is a 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.900
 girl inside a small robot wick and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.320
 she spends all her time fighting a 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.110
 giant joker and second story suggests 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.629
 is putting planet earth in danger 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.780
 so all the stages are a struggle 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.880
 against this same enemy that is huge and 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.310
 each time he is defeated back in a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.390
 even more sophisticated it is difficult 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.850
 to hit 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.770
 You can make one of three weapons one 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.680
 that shoots in three directions 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.770
 one of laws is that it can concentrate a 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.270
 very powerful shot and a body attack to 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.970
 body not found kinda useless phases 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.060
 they are in the best buffet style ie in 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.280
 shot of all parties and so you 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.920
 spend more time concentrating on diverting 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.720
 while stripping you of what to give 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.909
 attention to the characteristics of the enemy 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.189
 in itself two aggravating factors for the difficulty 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.740
 of the games are the controls in the 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.720
 no more accurate touchscreen 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.729
 of the world and the size of the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.729
 character you control has already put 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.860
 practically a third of the left screen and 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.740
 this obviously makes the target more 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.840
 easy to build nagao use with this 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.970
 although the next one seems to me a better 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.040
 indication if it is aimed at people who 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.140
 They really like rain and max 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.140
 especially those more challenging 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.440
 although it seems like a half-mouth game and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.750
 without salt at first glance retro in them 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.310
 an Islamic link is very nice and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.550
 own qualities 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.490
 the graphics are well base matches follow 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.170
 a half minecraft style already gameplay 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.220
 has its own characteristics in the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.800
 commands 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.620
 here you use a left side of the screen 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.930
 to move sideways with soares and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.370
 one right side to jump a lot 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.290
 quick ringtones 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.330
 Moreover, these commands can cause 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.820
 certain estrangement in the beginning since 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.820
 flee from the usual but nothing that the ten 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.590
 minutes of resolute training during 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.230
 matches you run on a track 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.110
 athletics with the classic goal of 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.330
 reach as far as possible and for this 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.880
 you need to avoid obstacles and 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.310
 other corridors besides picking up 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.890
 items that appear scattered in the middle of the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.440
 scenario and do for example with which you 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 stay small and avoid breaking the barriers 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.480
 an interesting differential here is that 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.700
 there is a seat bar that will 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.040
 lowering as you run and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.050
 fill in required to pick up some pots 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.030
 water that are distributed during the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.800
 racing 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.530
 there are some types of corridor for 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.459
 train there that will them women 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.890
 going through zombies coming to skulls 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.620
 difference is not only aesthetic since 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.470
 they have skills like not staying with 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.110
 seat or flying of opponents 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.600
 just like any free retro game 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.209
 years offers some cash shopping 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.550
 within the epp but is far from 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.430
 to fill the bag this in general to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.840
 modest experience and enjoyable one 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.840
 Grace does not cost trying 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:21.600
 was one of the main highlights of the pocket 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.580
 or next is undoubtedly its simplicity and 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.669
 as poetic as it may seem 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.490
 it is precisely the simplicity that gives this 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.160
 play a certain sophistication that the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.560
 differs from most of the 200 vacancies 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.780
 currently available 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.720
 you control a scientist who was 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.910
 trapped in the experiment itself and 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.789
 walk on the platform plane after 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.139
 platform an ambiance that made up 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:52.199
 there are no coins or rap 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.490
 to get caught or upgrade to do 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.900
 You can jump forward or sideways. 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.930
 holding the key in those directions to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.389
 more time in the air when they reach 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.120
 some types of platform a meter 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.669
 percentage and and when it reaches 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.360
 100% and it's as if you unlock a 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.849
 new phase that has rhythm music and 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.680
 dynamics of different pure what it requires 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.190
 learning a new standard for 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.409
 even for those who are tired of 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.050
 two weeks because the next one is an indication 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.449
 It would fearlessly he brings 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.180
 simplicity of other famous games in the 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.280
 genre as a baute guy joined there 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.440
 changes in scenario patterns creates 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.409
 a new gaming experience the most 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.469
 unlikely that this may seem 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.469
 O 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.890
