00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
there I think part of the problem with

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.170 
there I think part of the problem with
our<00:04:28.250> running<00:04:28.760> game<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:29.210> we<00:04:29.810> don't<00:04:29.960> have<00:04:30.260> an<00:04:31.180> SEC

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
our running game is we don't have an SEC

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.200 
our running game is we don't have an SEC
running<00:04:32.540> back<00:04:32.720> yet<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:34.340> got<00:04:34.520> some<00:04:34.700> young<00:04:34.940> guys

that<00:04:35.830> could<00:04:36.830> get<00:04:37.040> there<00:04:37.480> but<00:04:38.480> we<00:04:38.600> obviously

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
that could get there but we obviously

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.640 
that could get there but we obviously
don't<00:04:39.380> have<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> freshman<00:04:40.400> freshman<00:04:41.060> phenom
