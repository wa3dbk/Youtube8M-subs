today what did an early ancestor of

today what did an early ancestor of

humans look like they would probably say

humans look like they would probably say
well<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.580> would<00:01:29.820> look<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.060> Lucy<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.310> before

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
well it would look like Lucy and before

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.080 
well it would look like Lucy and before
that<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.789> would<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.390> chimpanzee

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
that it would look like a chimpanzee

what the fossils that are being

is<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.710> both<00:01:44.039> of<00:01:44.429> those<00:01:44.880> conclusions<00:01:45.240> are

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
is that both of those conclusions are

00:01:45.960 --> 00:02:07.130 
is that both of those conclusions are
very<00:01:46.409> incorrect

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.010 

we<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.190> see<00:02:08.460> that<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.940> primitive<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.840> this
