00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
but it's not always easy you get to see

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.750 
but it's not always easy you get to see
that<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> show<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.349> have

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
that on the show as we have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.330 
that on the show as we have
those<00:02:14.000> challenges<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.840> think<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.860> men<00:02:16.099> want

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
those challenges I think all men want

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.309 
those challenges I think all men want
that<00:02:16.610> traditional<00:02:17.269> woman<00:02:17.569> sometimes<00:02:18.079> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
that traditional woman sometimes and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.410 
that traditional woman sometimes and
that<00:02:18.379> woman<00:02:18.769> on<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.069> go<00:02:19.220> sometimes<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.329> know

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
that woman on the go sometimes you know

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.910 
that woman on the go sometimes you know
but<00:02:20.510> they<00:02:20.569> can't<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.110> both<00:02:21.260> ways<00:02:21.319> you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
but they can't have it both ways you

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.559 
but they can't have it both ways you
know<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.430> see<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.909> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.239> show<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.540> well

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
phone numbers on it and I thought this

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.849 
phone numbers on it and I thought this

players and it was like anybody called

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.140 
players and it was like anybody called
me<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.590> realized<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.609> know<00:02:43.640> groupies

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
me and I realized that you know groupies

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.149 
me and I realized that you know groupies
were<00:02:44.359> real<00:02:44.629> but<00:02:45.019> my<00:02:45.349> husband<00:02:45.680> has<00:02:45.799> never<00:02:45.950> given

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
were real but my husband has never given

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.039 
were real but my husband has never given
me<00:02:46.370> anything<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.730> worry<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:47.629> know

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
me anything to worry about and you know

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.050 
me anything to worry about and you know
the<00:02:48.890> few<00:02:49.099> times<00:02:49.340> we've<00:02:49.549> been<00:02:49.579> in<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.849> situation

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
the few times we've been in a situation

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.699 
the few times we've been in a situation
where<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.629> chick<00:02:50.900> was<00:02:51.049> close<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.409> think<00:02:51.620> they

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
where a chick was close I think they

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.190 
where a chick was close I think they
could<00:02:51.920> tell<00:02:52.159> I<00:02:52.430> don't<00:02:52.730> play<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.840> it's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
could tell I don't play that so it's

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.129 
could tell I don't play that so it's
been<00:02:54.440> good<00:02:54.650> all<00:02:54.980> good<00:02:55.010> oh<00:02:55.579> man<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.139> got

was a great experience for me growing up

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.449 
was a great experience for me growing up
I<00:03:32.419> felt<00:03:32.449> like<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.079> had<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.440> be<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> tomboy<00:03:34.010> in

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
I felt like I had to be a tomboy in

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.460 
I felt like I had to be a tomboy in
order<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.819> be<00:03:34.970> taken<00:03:35.299> seriously<00:03:35.690> as<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:36.199> female

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

order to be taken seriously as a female
athlete<00:03:36.949> and<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.549> think<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.120> notion<00:03:38.299> has

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
athlete and I think that that notion has

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.180 
athlete and I think that that notion has
changed<00:03:39.019> over<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.230> years<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.739> if<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:39.889> love

changed over the years and if you love

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.129 
changed over the years and if you love
fashion<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.730> love<00:03:41.000> beauty<00:03:41.389> you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.810> go<00:03:42.019> out

there and be respected as an athlete and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.009 
there and be respected as an athlete and
I<00:03:43.849> want<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.150> continue<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.660> be<00:03:44.750> an<00:03:44.810> ambassador

I want to continue to be an ambassador
for<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.129> that<00:03:46.310> young<00:03:46.669> girls<00:03:46.940> won't<00:03:47.180> want

for that so that young girls won't want

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.030 
for that so that young girls won't want

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
it and hopefully I'm empowered other

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.069 
it and hopefully I'm empowered other
women<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.910> go<00:03:53.000> out<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.209> do<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.419> same<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:53.840> I

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
women to go out and do the same I I

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.349 
women to go out and do the same I I
definitely<00:03:54.980> understand<00:03:55.639> the<00:03:55.879> black<00:03:56.090> girls

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
definitely understand the black girls

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.270 
definitely understand the black girls
worries<00:03:56.930> with<00:03:57.109> our<00:03:57.290> hair<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.739> working<00:03:58.099> out

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
worries with our hair and working out

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.059 
worries with our hair and working out
and<00:03:58.609> so<00:03:58.909> for<00:03:59.510> me<00:03:59.659> I<00:03:59.690> find<00:04:00.349> what<00:04:00.530> works<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.949> I

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
and so for me I find what works is I

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.009 
and so for me I find what works is I
wear<00:04:01.280> extensions<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:02.000> lot<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.389> that<00:04:02.599> helps<00:04:02.959> to

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
wear extensions a lot and that helps to

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.830 
wear extensions a lot and that helps to
keep<00:04:03.139> my<00:04:03.440> natural<00:04:03.919> hair<00:04:04.209> from<00:04:05.209> breaking<00:04:05.389> and

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
keep my natural hair from breaking and

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.539 
keep my natural hair from breaking and
damaging<00:04:06.379> I<00:04:06.500> don't<00:04:06.650> have<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> relaxer<00:04:07.340> on<00:04:07.370> my

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
damaging I don't have a relaxer on my

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.740 
damaging I don't have a relaxer on my
natural<00:04:07.849> hair<00:04:07.970> right<00:04:08.180> now<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.599> also

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
natural hair right now so that also

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.349 
natural hair right now so that also
helps<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:09.829> by<00:04:10.010> having<00:04:10.250> my<00:04:10.519> extensions<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
helps but by having my extensions I

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.430 
helps but by having my extensions I
don't<00:04:11.569> have<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.780> worry<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:11.989> putting<00:04:12.139> heat

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
don't have to worry about putting heat

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.050 
don't have to worry about putting heat
