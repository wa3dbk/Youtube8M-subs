00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.120
 sure the technician does with a new video 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 this video is always a video for 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 regarding the reconstruction of the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 nails in this case how to apply the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.770
 4 c colored gel is colored so 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 correct 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.779
 I will be the example with this gel of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 also makes him a time gel that in fact 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 changes color with heat and with 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.080
 cold and we are immediately the procedure 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.330
 I have already done the reconstruction with the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.619
 cattini I leave you the video link here 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.809
 precisely where I show you how 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 create it now he has done all too 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 procedures and put us the base gel or 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 catalyzed I made the camber or 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.460
 catalysed milled crowning for 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 make it more perfect and it will point 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.079
 we have reached this point where 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.199
 we have the matted nail with both the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.489
 spending or with the file than with the buffer 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.390
 now let's take the color that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.539
 favorite 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 I use issues of the aia e 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.649
 all colors is very important first 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 to use them to mix them used a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.250
 simple thin 20 but if you have 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.619
 spatula just used place 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.780
 those are very important to mix 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.430
 all of them colors because the pigments are 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.510
 they separate and therefore it is not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.830
 full 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
 then I take my little brush 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 use only for colors because 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.040
 in fact, otherwise the risk of dirtying the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.830
 viral colored also clear gels such as ad 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.680
 example the builder buzzer and start 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
 to take the product e 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.439
 apply it on long and very important 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.909
 apply as first for me first base 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.400
 a very very fine color wait 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.130
 because it depends on some colors 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.170
 example given some who retired 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600
 during 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.580
 catalyst if I put too much 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 in fact I have to do a lot of states 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.170
 very transparent and will do everything fine 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.899
 precisely more passages and put them to 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.369
 otherwise catalyze the missile color 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.020
 stains were drawn and created 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.280
 really very bad 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.899
 this gel you're using for 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.720
 luck does not have this problem then 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.210
 I can only do if you go through with a little 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.930
 more abundant we say the first pasta 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.390
 what I do are 80 to outline well around 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.069
 cuticles without ever touching them and precisely 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.709
 of the ego as much as my edge e 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.989
 also the tip of the nail I put the a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.180
 catalyze three minutes and then without 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.980
 photographing I 'll give you another past 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.260
 always paying attention to the cuticle kilo 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.360
 closing sides well and the tip because 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.310
 then you will see if not if the tip is of a 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.330
 other color 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.830
 I also put the second pass a 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.440
 catalyze if one was needed 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.959
 third you also make the third once 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.299
 take it off they call it from the oven 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.630
 you must not downgrade but pass 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.970
 directly to the gloss and to everything 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 this is the area even while a lot 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.200
 attentive and around cuticles although the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.780
 tip to the sides and then put the lamp 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 catalyze for 4 minutes or in any case if 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.700
 your cell of different times 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.250
 respect the time elapsed time 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.299
 precisely of breaking down everything 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.670
 how much 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.350
 and this is precisely his end these 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.780
 rules let's say they are worth a bit for everyone 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.940
 particle also to make French 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.160
 do some very fine passes and if the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.870
 yours was the point he retires o 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.690
 however be careful to close well 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.820
 the tip on the sides and in case 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.769
 Please apply rhinestones or gods 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.840
 glitter on your tribute to 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.060
 apply it immediately after the color first 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.890
 of transparent gel 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.500
 now I'll show you the particularity 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.959
 of this gel that remains with the cold 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.440
 dark border while with the heat it becomes 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.819
 red and it's really very beautiful 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.069
 I very much hope that this sex video 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.540
 sutil and if you have any questions 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.579
 written below in the comments 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.579
 a big kiss and the next hello
