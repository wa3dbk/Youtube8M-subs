00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.869 
beginning into anthropology into systems
of<00:02:33.030> ideas<00:02:33.620> pathologies<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.650> systems<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> ideas

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
of ideas pathologies of systems of ideas

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.430 
of ideas pathologies of systems of ideas
and<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.680> systems<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.250> ideas<00:02:38.670> which<00:02:38.910> are

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and then to systems of ideas which are

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.280 
and then to systems of ideas which are
how<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.860> all<00:02:41.040> try<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.819> live<00:02:42.030> together<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.720> we

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
how we all try to live together and we

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.500 
how we all try to live together and we
all<00:02:43.500> includes<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.250> animals<00:02:44.879> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> plants

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
all includes the animals in the plants

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.289 
all includes the animals in the plants
as<00:02:45.690> well<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.170> me<00:02:46.410> looking<00:02:47.310> at<00:02:47.879> just

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
as well as you and me looking at just

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.259 
as well as you and me looking at just
how<00:02:48.450> reality<00:02:49.370> unfolds<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.519> how<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.790> all<00:02:50.940> how

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
how reality unfolds and how it all how

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.420 
how reality unfolds and how it all how
it<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.510> works<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.170> when<00:02:52.859> you<00:02:52.980> take<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> little

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
it all works and when you take a little

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.460 
it all works and when you take a little
piece<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.030> then<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.019> look<00:02:55.140> at<00:02:55.319> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
piece of it then you just look at that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.259 
piece of it then you just look at that
little<00:02:55.650> piece<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.609> come<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:56.940> with<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> lot

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
little piece and you come up with a lot

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.720 
little piece and you come up with a lot
of<00:02:57.299> erroneous<00:02:58.370> interpretations<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.519> what's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
of erroneous interpretations of what's

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.099 
of erroneous interpretations of what's
going<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.450> always<00:03:01.109> thought<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.410> way<00:03:03.109> that

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
going on I always thought that way that

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.259 
going on I always thought that way that
the<00:03:04.260> relation<00:03:04.739> between<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.519> me<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the relation between what me and that

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.140 
the relation between what me and that
book<00:03:06.540> or<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> book<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.319> table<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:08.150> still

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
book or the book and the table is still

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.910 
book or the book and the table is still
a<00:03:10.160> microcosm<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.549> relation<00:03:12.150> between<00:03:12.920> man

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
