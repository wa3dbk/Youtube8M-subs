00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello everyone and as you asked me, I 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.030
 I review the program 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 but rather psp emulator well let's 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.630
 let's start here as well as for the emulator 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.330
 sege 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.460
 we will need two programs the first is 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 exactly the same as family games for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.750
 emulator about which I am now not particularly 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 I will tell you more 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.880
 in detail they look just 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 video emulator for sega or as 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.270
 Thunderstorm gu on android Well, in short, I'm 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.660
 I will say that we can find in it 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.329
 toys watch pictures of these games and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.710
 of course download these games 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.820
 but I advise you to download games for pes and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 emulator psp through various torrents and 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 it is very important that the image of these games was and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.149
 face with about 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 or with or and baby something of these three 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.469
 but as they go I will show you a little bit 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.170
 simpler 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.020
 well, the most important thing is the emulator itself 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 called he pi pi es es pi pi 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.400
 let's run 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 sorry for the glare but I will show how 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.340
 can 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.410
 This program looks like this inside 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.840
 It shows games that recently 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.090
 started and I'll show them a little 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.810
 later and now let's talk about 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.050
 settings 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.820
 I really liked the settings here 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.580
 graphics settings are so great for them 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.090
 a lot and you can customize settings 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.000
 customize to your tablet and somehow 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 optimize it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.190
 I liked it very much and very much 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.160
 it helped but not in everything so if 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.400
 someone understands then I think this is for you 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.670
 help a lot if you see me hi 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.580
 you probably see hi 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.290
 there are also audio settings here there 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.300
 there is the volume of sound in the volume of music 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.410
 Well, you see it all yourself 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.840
 I really liked the management here 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.360
 the fact that you can adjust the position 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.550
 buttons and transparency of the buttons that is, we 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 we can put where we are most comfortable 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.380
 and it is also very cool not to be there 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.620
 stretch if that's really me 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.200
 it was pleasant cool but also system here 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.959
 everything is clear and there are two very cool 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 tabs it disable shields and 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.200
 peace and model ie we can choose 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.850
 and this 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.890
 either psp 1000 or psp 2000 3000 well 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.950
 let's put 2000 3000 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.200
 try so back games games you we 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.510
 we choose exactly the same as for sego 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.420
 We have to pump money into the folder I have it 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.720
 download folder we create your own folder 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.049
 which you are more comfortable or like and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.850
 Throw to there all the games here they are 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.299
 we are displayed but I have here in 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.209
 mainly 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.440
 games for seguim but shown above and 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.470
 immediately with pictures 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.370
 games for ps and well 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.769
 Games a little as you see 6 pieces I tell you 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.900
 probably show not all about those that I 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.489
 I will not tell you just 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.049
 well let's start with the game that is me 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.730
 Liked it so cool and 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.420
 quite interesting 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:31.170
 little big planet if you have a pier and 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.170
 I think you heard about it choose the language 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.160
 sometimes the sound is not very good 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.560
 because of the tablet itself by the way the tablet on 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.190
 This tablet I have not done a review so 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.190
 I hope he will be soon 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.410
 So 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.860
 no, don't repeat 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.849
 what does he not want such 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.780
 apparently he does not want me to show you 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.780
 this game ok 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.440
 So 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.750
 here is a reklamka sometimes so this game I 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.630
 I guess Iâ€™ll not show you now 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.780
 Unfortunately it is a pity but anything can happen 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.840
 although it used to run the game in general 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.120
 that we ask in his thoughts 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.980
 other measures and what they are well in 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.840
 general yes cool if you're interested 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.850
 read them and download 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.870
 let's try again maybe all the same 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.910
 it will turn out very strange why by the way 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.520
 I loaded on before everything was loaded 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.520
 ok so 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:08.030
 asks to restart no okay now i'm 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:13.250
 it will not do so okay then 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.670
 show you the mortal kombat I have here 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:20.450
 even sort of preserve 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.520
 yes here I played a little bit let's 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.200
 will show 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.460
 I play as you remember not so much so 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.460
 you don't judge me strictly 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.390
 I'm playing for this show in my opinion or 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:43.060
 what kind 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.060
 shorter man with a hammer 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.830
 carriage hack strongly 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.540
 both stick can be controlled and just 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.540
 button is 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:05.490
 Now w and wait a little left 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.490
 we direct at the end 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.510
 this is powerful 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.870
 okay then I will not show you 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.490
 so more games in flatout pound of course 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.060
 cool toy but on this tablet 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.640
 on 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.980
 it slows me down if you have a tablet 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.500
 more powerful, I think you will have everything 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.890
 ok so and probably they will do it like this 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.770
 so that you can see even better 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:41.750
 picture so tekken tekken on at 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:45.920
 everything is fine when you start the game 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:49.010
 it slows down though with tutorial it does not 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.490
 brakes and everything goes fine assassin's 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.560
 creed 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.570
 well let's run me in my opinion too 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.570
 there is a preserve well let's see 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.110
 can also slow down so 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.730
 oh oo oo oo oo 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:17.699
 defiantly yes i rushed 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:33.310
 so I should be a little uncomfortable 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:36.730
 really fine tune everything under 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.410
 In general, something like this is next 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.030
 I will show very sorry that I can not 

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.940
 show little big planet 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.190
 I really wanted to show you a toy 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.890
 really cool so if you 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:51.610
 interesting download play in general 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:55.030
 I think this is quite voluminous. 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.060
 there was a review and if you liked it 

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:03.820
 Like I tried to download these 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:06.730
 games in general, that's all, but that's all 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:10.620
 Once again, put Like
