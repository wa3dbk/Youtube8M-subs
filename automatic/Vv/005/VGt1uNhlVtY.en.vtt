00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.109
 welcome friends with you romance in this 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.910
 video we 'll figure out how to play 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.450
 song va a star named sunshine 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 guitar 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.129
 Viktor Tsoi white snow will roll as they are 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.100
 called 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.360
 so let me just get you started 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 a little bit and then you separately 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.590
 We will explain how this is done so in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.890
 the principle of the song is played so simple 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890
 by fight 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 and so on it 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.080
 I recommend this song really 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.270
 learns that playing all because 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.100
 For some reason she became one of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.540
 most popular in general in general 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 a guitarist that is, they know her but 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.220
 almost everything is real, that is, I think 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.620
 that every guitarist in Russia owes her 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 know or at least be able to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 play and so let's first chords 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.960
 song chords are very simple begin 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.960
 they sai ie AM 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.970
 then her c 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 then jdm 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.320
 about the same 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.890
 and all the new only davyd played up 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.890
 the end that is you have the same 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.770
 and you do not not start again but here 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:42.040
 clamp dm too there lived under the light 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 the stars and there by the name of the sun 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.810
 then you can play the same thing just 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.360
 in the shortened version, that is, I think with 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.320
 chords, in principle, everything is clear 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.799
 mean only ketboy 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.780
 let me show you how I fight 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.119
 I actually almost all songs 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.399
 Viktor Tsoi from which is suitable for this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.990
 rhythm play my i like it a lot 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.020
 first it just plays and second it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.940
 as if in their own pace and level 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.130
 the volume is very suitable for mom on 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.410
 my personal amount in personal opinion and so 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.810
 how he plays see first we spend 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.330
 thumb down we do the movements 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 thumb 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.580
 and note not here it is not for me 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.230
 nails where we remove up 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.660
 namely, the thumb is obtained 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.930
 much softer means thumb 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.030
 held down muffled tass just 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.160
 put your hand on top of the strings then two 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.760
 times up 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.250
 muffled down muffled 2 size 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.920
 muffled down muffled two times up 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.290
 drowned out drowned out two cuts married 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.490
 or actually, that's basically all 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:52.350
 and when you play akorda you each 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.350
 City play twice ie AM 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 and so on, to say exactly in principle 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.830
 that is why the matter of sound 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.300
 cute woven how would i do 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.850
 small such a mix of these debts 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.030
 that is, look and you can play it 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.030
 So 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.790
 and can play like that 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.670
 that is, I'm just at the end after 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.680
 made 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.030
 drowned out a second time before starting 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.459
 it turns out the next fight that is 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.840
 hold your finger from top to bottom i'm still 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.580
 I add well, as if Iâ€™m still threading a little 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.300
 fingers with these two bottom up 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.300
 it turns out such a thing 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.870
 then where are they sitting 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.800
 and it turns out such a connection of these 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.870
 connection of two different fights but 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.870
 it's not necessary and so better good 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.000
 That's basically all my friends I want to say 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.740
 if you have any problems 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 play well then great but if u 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.590
 you have trouble switching 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.050
 chords for example that is you cannot 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.050
 immediately quickly switch from chords to 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.239
 court or you fail this fight 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.370
 play or you can't 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.230
 simultaneously switch chords and play 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.220
 this fight, that is, if you have something from 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.130
 that's what the problem is 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.990
 especially for you I recorded the course 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.180
 short trash out of three classes but he's like 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.280
 once again solves all these questions, that is 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.290
 passing it fulfill you have you 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.310
 synchronization will collapse 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.770
 simultaneous operation 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.770
 you will learn and will easily rearrange 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.810
 all the basic chords and make out just 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.510
 the battle you need is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.300
 you will be very easy 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.420
 that it is free for you you can 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.430
 download it by following the link you 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.410

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.530
 youtube is just go get 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.360
 course and practice after you 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.140
 him pass your guitar level 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.690
 mastery will greatly increase here in 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.700
 principle, probably all friends if it is 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.050
