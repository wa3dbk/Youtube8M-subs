 unique and it's wonderful we want to take back 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.170
 the dubbing that made us famous plan 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.629
 solutions 70 we think that when a 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.670
 company doubles its products with 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.469
 we can sell the best in 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.980
 Latin America because it is well folded and 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.980
 with quality 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.580
 of extreme 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.140
 what we are giving is fair 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 quality that people do not go for the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.190
 price but for the quality of its 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.580
 product because if I go for all the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.480
 market then I embrace all that not 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.100
 serves dubbing is a specialty 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.080
 then we decide 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.900
 specialize in dubbing but we are 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.610
 actors that we have covered many areas 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.610
