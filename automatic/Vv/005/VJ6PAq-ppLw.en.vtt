meat<00:02:58.450> which<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.690> think<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.470> one<00:03:00.830> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.300> best

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300

business<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.850> these<00:03:04.850> goats<00:03:05.680> as<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.920> know<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
business and these goats as you know the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.880 
business and these goats as you know the
gestation<00:03:11.120> period<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.510> five<00:03:11.780> months<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
gestation period is five months so the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.900
