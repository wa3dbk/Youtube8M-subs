00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello thinkers friends in today's program let's talk about screen sink 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 the tilapia found in most of the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.919
 Brazil can generate up to four spawnings in the year 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:22.210
 the female lays eggs in a minute on a clean sand in August races the game 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.249
 The following are more plentiful that are fertilized by March in a 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 number of a dozen to two thousand orphans 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160
 our fishing today 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.140
 the tilapia is sober 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.250
 tilapia is a fish found in almost all fisheries 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.240
 it's a fish 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.720
 very tasty 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.980
 and that fishermen love to fish 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.060
 We are going to try two pecs. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 I'll try with telescopic now 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.460
 yes the Swiss 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.490
 and my father's competition will take work 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.100
 the bologna 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.530
 with the title 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.520
 also on the telescopic pole 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.100
 with a float but also made a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.950
 we'll bring these two techniques there 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.330
 to see which is the best 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 from year to year we are not competing 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.859
 just to show you guys sing at home there 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.660
 which is the best 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.759
 better lose 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.690
 with borges although consumption without rain 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.880
 I'm not talking about this program either. 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.980
 on the tilapia with various curiosities on thematic 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
 the best way to capture go fishing father 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 the new 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.439
 the first fish 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.629
 He left and we're still fishing in the 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.869
 have to auto clÃ©bio 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 with two socks soon after my father helps me here 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.239
 in the same year the mother 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.709
 team people 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.749
 withdrawal it is not a fish that provides for the purchase of popular vote 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.309
 half a kilo 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.239
 she does not deliver easily 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.589
 to investigate 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:46.899
 many politicians 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.529
 will be cool 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:49.809
 the first document 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.809
 I'll take 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.279
 by the tv screen 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.609
 this fish here 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:15.680
 he spawns it can be spawned up to four times a year you can believe 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.909
 in that 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.979
 and every time we have a game today 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.989
 he puts more or less 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.090
 two thousand dead 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.279
 so many do much work and I did it here 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.969
 if he has in the tan 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.090
 lp dominates 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.300
 takes care of his club 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.639
 there are many requests 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.159
 and every time 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.069
 of 2011 gold 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.069
 The show is here to take my father's eye. 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:56.939
 my father 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.939
 Give a tip, you guys are cool. 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.159
 put on 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.159
 on the outside 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.620
 Seville comes 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.089
 half a kilo but at the same time 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.169
 months after they were discovered we took several stretches 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.529
 - perhaps because of the fishing charter life 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.689
 here is a fleet plan 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.960
 just continue like this 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.600
 for its part
