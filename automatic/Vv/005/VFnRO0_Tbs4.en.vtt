00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 and well hello it's cupertino us 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.790
 are sunday 9h 44 28 april 2013 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello here so I make this video 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.340
 for actually just had I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.820
 did not have coffee anymore and that's not 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.470
 possible 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.590
 and so I buy coffee at lidl 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.349
 since lidl does not sell 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.640
 jackdaws what do they have gallou 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.390
 Jacques Vabre something like that I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.520
 wanted a coffee a little more full-bodied and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 then it does not work well in this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.540
 kind of machine take a coffee jacques 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 vabre it does not work he horrifies 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.320
 for so I have so I'm a crazy I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.140
 am a kamikaze who am I 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 the ironman so here I bought this coffee 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.420
 which is a 100% arabica espresso so that 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.180
 should be good the brand of lidl cp 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 the aroma beautiful aromas by which is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.140
 funny is that according to a recipe 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 Italian then I think the bishop 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 who without they have they had to copy a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 recipe 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.470
 they were in the machined they copied 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 to finally receive it in short from a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.939
 recipe that they would have found some 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.470
 share so imagine the thing that is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.200
 important to know and what's fun 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.570
 but to amy you I do not advance before 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 to have doubted 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 of course distributed by lidl france but 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.759
 he abhorred in Germany ah good ones 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.350
 Germans are not cons we will say 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.300
 if the Italians arrive there the Germans 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.500
 should get there except that one 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.660
 they have very bad taste 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.080
 dress for cars that's fine 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.310
 but then for clothes not the same 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.790
 time the haircuts i would say 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.430
 finally me I'm going to have these people and 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.570
 I lived a little bit in germany 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.910
 so what are we going to do we will do a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.070
 test I will prepare that then we see each other 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.290
 in the following video mallet has everything 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.030
 now I'm back 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.270
 so regarding so frozen put in a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.680
 box finally that's how it's a 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.660
 box then very important to protect 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.350
 coffee light or salt moisture 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.160
 etc. 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.489
 I'm not actually gringo I do not I do not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.989
 do not tell me coffee expert but then 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:22.970
 for the smell I would say it looks like 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.440
 assembles a coffee just jacques 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.140
 vabre but hey he's scared it's not 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.640
 so we will prepare it and then we will 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.320
 go well I think we are we are 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.470
 ready we fix it we're ready we're 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:42.410
 to the third we are gogo 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.390
 I turn on there I looked to Jacques 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.390
 rannou 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.519
 so yes it's a gas stove 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.560
 cookers as you want them to gas 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.430
 and I like 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.010
 I like the guy I do not like life 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.540
 too much have celebrated his purpose what I cook 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.100
 I have many holes and then I like 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 not life too much we'll put a little 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.390
 that's how pretty it is beautiful 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.750
 we believe the crystal fountains 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.720
 of altaïr 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.600
 that's good going immediately I 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.820
 get started we will count when the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.920
 first gurgles will appear 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.020
 we will even see the color of the coffee go 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.940
 immediately go first quarters 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.180
 blow it should not delay now we 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.180
 will wait 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.390
 so some say it does not take 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.380
 clean inside the receptacle 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.350
 magical it is still necessary the rat is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.260
 still I would not be here thanks to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.910
 fund that's what's important too 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.220
 so if for me that I do not do it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.750
 too often it's once the coffee 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.630
 exit touil with the cook in the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.370
 coffee maker even to mix a little the look 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.200
 did so always I'm not a 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.900
 expert 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.820
 I do not claim expert coffee makers 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.970
 Italian or Italian coffees 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.510
 simply I appreciate so that's the first 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.510
 snowy if I can say 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.650
 the color you are not bad six coffees 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.650
 lidoli keeps its promises 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.290
 so I do not know if it's just 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.500
 packaged in germany finally 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.330
 visibly elaborated for me it's islands 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.820
 and mussels in germany in all 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.980
 case it sure he does not push in 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.690
 Germany 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.020
 yeah it's clearer than my coffee 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.020
 usual 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.260
 so right now we'll go to the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.260
 tasting right away 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:01.640
 the smell already it's not that I was going to say 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.300
 he does not tear off a foot a nakiele budget 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.300
 in the sea of ​​its vats 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.870
 I already have sweet meadow after if I have my 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:19.910
 sugar friends I should see him without sugar 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:20.830
 but I find my opinion there is no 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.190
 mystery 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:30.590
 note the saucer assorted to montreal or 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:32.479
 that of table and well as I said 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.530
 before my group video 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.530
 Well, it's cat piss
