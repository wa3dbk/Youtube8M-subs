good day all its Revere hope you are
well

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
well

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.480 
well
I<00:00:08.570> use<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> same<00:00:09.900> intro<00:00:10.349> every<00:00:10.620> time<00:00:11.040> on<00:00:11.370> my

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I use the same intro every time on my

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.470 
I use the same intro every time on my
videos<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:13.019> anyway<00:00:13.920> we're<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:14.490> exactly

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
videos but it anyway we're now exactly

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.870 
videos but it anyway we're now exactly
halfway<00:00:15.750> through<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.650> stronger<00:00:17.520> Big<00:00:17.670> Sky

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
halfway through the stronger Big Sky

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.370 
halfway through the stronger Big Sky
demos<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:18.600> been<00:00:18.750> putting<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.140> recently

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
demos that I've been putting up recently

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.640 
demos that I've been putting up recently
I<00:00:19.859> hope<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.400> been<00:00:20.580> enjoying<00:00:20.760> them<00:00:21.590> trying<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
I hope you been enjoying them trying to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.410 
I hope you been enjoying them trying to
keep<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:22.980> short<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> concise<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
keep them short and concise and just a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
keep them short and concise and just a
little<00:00:24.539> bit<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.960> each<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.380> better<00:00:25.580> now

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
little bit about each one better now

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.269 
little bit about each one better now
we've<00:00:26.789> moved<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.869> cloud<00:00:28.199> reverb<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
we've moved on to the cloud reverb this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
we've moved on to the cloud reverb this
one<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:30.510> very<00:00:31.199> much<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.560> signature

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
one is I think very much a signature

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.450 
one is I think very much a signature
sound<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.850> Stram<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.480> been<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.460> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
sound that Stram have been going for the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.660 
sound that Stram have been going for the
idea<00:00:35.820> behind<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:37.309> massive<00:00:38.309> big

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
idea behind it is just massive big

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.990 
idea behind it is just massive big
ambien<00:00:39.210> reverb<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.620> suppose<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> fantasy

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
ambien reverb I suppose like a fantasy

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
ambien reverb I suppose like a fantasy
style<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.930> thing<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.500> just

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
style kind of thing like you can just

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.250 
style kind of thing like you can just
create<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.730> cool<00:00:44.760> ambien<00:00:45.329> atmospheres

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
create really cool ambien atmospheres

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.250 
create really cool ambien atmospheres
and<00:00:46.320> textures<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> yeah<00:00:48.870> let's<00:00:49.140> have

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and textures with it so yeah let's have

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.470 
and textures with it so yeah let's have
a<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> closer<00:00:50.370> camp<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.300> what

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a look on the closer camp and see what

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
a look on the closer camp and see what
the<00:00:51.539> parameters<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.590> low<00:00:53.219> end<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.730> normal

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the parameters do so low end as normal

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.290 
the parameters do so low end as normal
with<00:00:54.329> parameter<00:00:54.750> 1<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.770> diffusion<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> on

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
with parameter 1 and the diffusion is on

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.290 
with parameter 1 and the diffusion is on
a<00:00:57.329> minus<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.199> plus<00:00:58.230> scale<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> permit<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.609> now

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
a minus and plus scale and permit to now

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
a minus and plus scale and permit to now
if<00:01:00.420> we're<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> parameter<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.070> got

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
if we're going to parameter what we got

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.179 
if we're going to parameter what we got
so<00:01:02.489> we've<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> low<00:01:02.940> end<00:01:03.409> diffusion<00:01:04.409> boost

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so we've got a low end diffusion boost

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.850 
so we've got a low end diffusion boost
so<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.450> very<00:01:06.659> quite<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.500> simpler

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so this is very quite a lot of simpler

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.810 
so this is very quite a lot of simpler
this<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:09.020> with<00:01:10.020> regards<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this one with regards to you know the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.910 
this one with regards to you know the
actual<00:01:12.180> there's<00:01:12.900> always<00:01:13.080> normally<00:01:13.770> extra

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
actual there's always normally extra

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.240 
actual there's always normally extra
parameters<00:01:16.920> inside<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.780> main<00:01:18.780> edit<00:01:19.250> button

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
parameters inside the main edit button

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
parameters inside the main edit button
here<00:01:20.299> whereas<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.810> everything's<00:01:22.770> here

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
here whereas really everything's here

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
here whereas really everything's here
that<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.460> need<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.939> particular<00:01:24.180> reverb

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that you need for this particular reverb

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
that you need for this particular reverb
so<00:01:25.229> we've<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.560> tone<00:01:25.890> yeah<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.610> let<00:01:26.790> me<00:01:26.880> just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so we've got tone yeah so let me just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.039 
so we've got tone yeah so let me just
dial<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.990> something<00:01:29.240> give<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
dial in something give it a bit of this

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.450 
dial in something give it a bit of this
bit<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.900> wanna<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.590> diffusion<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
bit of that I wanna on a lot diffusion I

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:48.780 
bit of that I wanna on a lot diffusion I
like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.150> be<00:01:36.299> diffused<00:01:37.400> okay

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:04:46.210 

you

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.749 

so<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:48.229> mean<00:04:49.229> enough<00:04:49.710> said<00:04:50.009> about<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.460> one<00:04:50.639> I

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
so I mean enough said about that one I

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.370 
so I mean enough said about that one I
really<00:04:51.060> don't<00:04:51.300> need<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:51.449> go<00:04:51.720> into<00:04:51.900> detail

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
really don't need to go into detail

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.370 
really don't need to go into detail
about<00:04:52.410> how<00:04:52.800> amazing<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.319> a

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
about how amazing that is but it's a

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.309 
about how amazing that is but it's a
really<00:04:55.650> simple<00:04:56.490> design<00:04:57.060> around<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.930> reverb

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
really simple design around the reverb

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.559 
really simple design around the reverb
machine<00:04:58.680> in<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.430> sense<00:04:59.699> that<00:05:00.030> there<00:05:00.419> isn't

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
machine in the sense that there isn't

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.749 
machine in the sense that there isn't
much<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:01.410> can<00:05:01.590> adjust<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:02.460> then<00:05:02.639> again

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
much that you can adjust but then again

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.580 
much that you can adjust but then again
the<00:05:03.120> reverb<00:05:03.509> is<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.870> good<00:05:04.169> that<00:05:04.199> you

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
the reverb is that good that you

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.379 
the reverb is that good that you
shouldn't<00:05:04.889> really<00:05:05.039> need<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.580> do<00:05:05.759> much<00:05:06.030> to

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
shouldn't really need to do much to

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.629 
shouldn't really need to do much to
adjust<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.139> mean<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.800> tone<00:05:08.069> knob<00:05:08.370> allows

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
adjust it I mean the tone knob allows

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.480 
adjust it I mean the tone knob allows
you<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:09.169> mess<00:05:10.169> around<00:05:10.349> making<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.919> darker<00:05:11.340> or

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
you to mess around making a darker or

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.010 
you to mess around making a darker or
lighter<00:05:11.520> depending<00:05:12.120> on<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.539> kind<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.840> thing

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
lighter depending on the kind of thing

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.960 
lighter depending on the kind of thing
you<00:05:13.440> want<00:05:13.590> to<00:05:13.680> play<00:05:13.889> but<00:05:14.490> other<00:05:14.669> than<00:05:14.849> that

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
you want to play but other than that
