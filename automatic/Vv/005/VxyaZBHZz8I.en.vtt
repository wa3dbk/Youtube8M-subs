00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.130 

image<00:00:02.219> planes<00:00:02.489> are<00:00:02.610> used<00:00:02.759> often<00:00:02.999> in<00:00:03.509> Maya<00:00:03.810> to

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
image planes are used often in Maya to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.170 
image planes are used often in Maya to
make<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.410> modeling<00:00:04.920> process<00:00:05.100> easier<00:00:06.000> and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
make the modeling process easier and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.179 
make the modeling process easier and
what<00:00:06.630> I've<00:00:06.720> done<00:00:06.840> here<00:00:07.110> is<00:00:07.320> I've<00:00:07.650> captured<00:00:07.890> a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
what I've done here is I've captured a

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.310 
what I've done here is I've captured a
model<00:00:08.550> with<00:00:08.730> photography<00:00:09.390> under<00:00:10.019> two

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
model with photography under two

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.770 
model with photography under two
different<00:00:10.500> lighting<00:00:11.309> schemes<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.269> we<00:00:12.390> can<00:00:12.570> see

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
different lighting schemes so we can see

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.750 
different lighting schemes so we can see
multiple<00:00:13.380> types<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.800> reference<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.610> we're

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
multiple types of reference that we're

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.970 
multiple types of reference that we're
going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.940> model<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.389> top<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.830> my

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
going to model on top of so I have my

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.519 
going to model on top of so I have my
front<00:00:17.310> view<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.580> my<00:00:18.060> side<00:00:18.449> view<00:00:18.780> but<00:00:19.230> these

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
front view and my side view but these

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.439 
front view and my side view but these
aren't<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.220> photos<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> I've<00:00:21.180> taken

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
aren't the only photos that I've taken

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.439 
aren't the only photos that I've taken
I've<00:00:22.170> also<00:00:22.529> taken<00:00:22.890> photos<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.609> more<00:00:23.850> extreme

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I've also taken photos with more extreme

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.500 
I've also taken photos with more extreme
side<00:00:25.320> lighting<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.520> makes<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:27.090> models

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
side lighting and this makes the models

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.840 
side lighting and this makes the models
figure<00:00:27.990> pop<00:00:28.350> I<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.859> see<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> lot<00:00:29.279> more<00:00:29.310> muscle

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
figure pop I can see a lot more muscle

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.060 
figure pop I can see a lot more muscle
detail<00:00:30.570> showing<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.769> will<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.039> very

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
detail showing up and that will be very

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.400 
detail showing up and that will be very
useful<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.210> comes<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.660> texturing<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
useful when it comes to texturing and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
useful when it comes to texturing and
sculpting<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.489> image<00:00:35.730> planes<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.210> going

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
sculpting for my image planes I'm going

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
sculpting for my image planes I'm going
to<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> more<00:00:36.899> evenly<00:00:37.350> lit<00:00:37.590> version<00:00:38.070> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
to use the more evenly lit version so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.979 
to use the more evenly lit version so
that<00:00:38.280> there's<00:00:38.610> less<00:00:38.670> distractions<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.780> what

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that there's less distractions and what

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
that there's less distractions and what
I'll<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.290> I'll<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.280> image<00:00:41.820> canvas

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I'll do is I'll go to my image canvas

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'll do is I'll go to my image canvas
size<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.170> I'll<00:00:43.710> double<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> width<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.850> my

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
size and I'll double the width of my

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
size and I'll double the width of my
front<00:00:46.050> view<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.860> doing<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> can

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
front view and I'm doing this so I can

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.250 
front view and I'm doing this so I can
compare<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> front<00:00:48.510> view<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.780> side<00:00:48.989> view

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
compare the front view and side view

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.069 
compare the front view and side view
directly<00:00:50.000> side-by-side<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.809> I'll<00:00:51.930> do

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
directly side-by-side and what I'll do

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.020 
directly side-by-side and what I'll do
is<00:00:52.200> I'll<00:00:52.320> drag<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.920> side<00:00:53.190> view<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
is I'll drag the side view into the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
is I'll drag the side view into the
front<00:00:54.300> views<00:00:54.539> canvas<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> I'll<00:00:55.559> trim<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
front views canvas and I'll trim the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.740 
front views canvas and I'll trim the
side<00:00:56.309> you're<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.579> using<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.120> marquee<00:00:57.539> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
side you're just using my marquee and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
side you're just using my marquee and
hitting<00:00:57.989> delete<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.920> rid<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> I'll

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
hitting delete to get rid of it and I'll

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090 
hitting delete to get rid of it and I'll
crop<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> image<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> width<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
crop the image just to the width of the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
crop the image just to the width of the
two<00:01:02.309> reference<00:01:03.059> photos<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.870> want<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.109> make

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
two reference photos and I want to make

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
two reference photos and I want to make
sure<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.469> my<00:01:04.589> rulers<00:01:05.039> are<00:01:05.219> on<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.759> view<00:01:06.090> menu

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sure that my rulers are on so view menu

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.230 
sure that my rulers are on so view menu
rulers<00:01:06.959> and<00:01:07.249> once<00:01:08.249> I<00:01:08.399> have<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.579> rulers<00:01:08.969> turned

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
rulers and once I have the rulers turned

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.139 
rulers and once I have the rulers turned
on<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.959> drag<00:01:10.380> down<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.279> rulers<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
on I can drag down from the rulers and

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.039 
on I can drag down from the rulers and
I'm<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.389> to<00:01:12.420> create<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.719> bunch<00:01:12.899> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
I'm going to create a bunch of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.529 
I'm going to create a bunch of
guidelines<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.069> match<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.999> front<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.450> my

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
guidelines to match up my front and my

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.599 
guidelines to match up my front and my
side<00:01:15.929> view<00:01:15.959> so<00:01:16.469> what<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.859> looking<00:01:17.189> for<00:01:17.429> are

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
side view so what I'm looking for are

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.789 
side view so what I'm looking for are
distinctive<00:01:18.599> points<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.319> front<00:01:19.590> view

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
distinctive points on the front view

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
distinctive points on the front view
such<00:01:20.069> as<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> edge<00:01:20.459> of<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> clavicle<00:01:21.359> or<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
such as the edge of the clavicle or the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.959 
such as the edge of the clavicle or the
nipple<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.529> also<00:01:23.219> show<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
nipple that also show up in the

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.929 
nipple that also show up in the
corresponding<00:01:24.869> view<00:01:25.159> under<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> a

corresponding view under where here is a
good<00:01:27.149> point<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.679> compare<00:01:29.069> the<00:01:29.189> two

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
good point that I can compare the two

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.099 
good point that I can compare the two
references<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> make<00:01:30.329> sure<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.899> they're

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:31.109 
references to make sure that they're

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:34.849 
references to make sure that they're
lined<00:01:31.469> up<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.789> lower<00:01:33.029> leg<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.499> line

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
lined up now the lower leg will not line

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.109 
lined up now the lower leg will not line
up<00:01:34.889> we're<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> be<00:01:35.819> able<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.029> do

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
up we're not going to be able to do

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.239 
up we're not going to be able to do
anything<00:01:36.749> below<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.169> knee<00:01:37.349> don't<00:01:37.979> worry

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
anything below the knee don't worry

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.760 
anything below the knee don't worry
about<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.259> generally<00:01:40.259> we'll<00:01:40.409> see<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
about it and generally we'll see that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.409 
about it and generally we'll see that
there<00:01:40.919> are<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.159> mismatches<00:01:41.909> between<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:42.419 
there are some mismatches between the

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.169 
there are some mismatches between the
two<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.169> I'll<00:01:43.259> use<00:01:43.499> my<00:01:43.529> edit<00:01:44.159> transform<00:01:44.579> tools

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
two so I'll use my edit transform tools

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.749 
two so I'll use my edit transform tools
like<00:01:45.419> scale<00:01:45.779> and<00:01:46.049> rotate<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.159> changes<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like scale and rotate to make changes to

like scale and rotate to make changes to
the<00:01:48.090> side<00:01:48.479> view<00:01:48.929> our<00:01:49.169> front<00:01:50.130> view<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.520> our

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the side view our front view is our

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.269 
the side view our front view is our
dominant<00:01:51.299> reference<00:01:51.749> we<00:01:52.200> want<00:01:52.409> our<00:01:52.499> side<00:01:52.889> view

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
dominant reference we want our side view

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.789 
dominant reference we want our side view
to<00:01:53.310> match<00:01:53.639> our<00:01:53.880> front<00:01:54.239> view<00:01:54.319> not<00:01:55.319> vice<00:01:55.590> versa

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to match our front view not vice versa

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.370 
to match our front view not vice versa
now<00:01:56.700> once<00:01:57.029> I'm<00:01:57.239> done<00:01:57.389> adjusting<00:01:57.539> I'll<00:01:58.049> save<00:01:58.349> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now once I'm done adjusting I'll save it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.669 
now once I'm done adjusting I'll save it
and<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:58.979> I'll<00:01:59.189> crop<00:01:59.819> my<00:02:00.179> image<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:01.289> highlight

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
and then I'll crop my image to highlight

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.080 
and then I'll crop my image to highlight
either<00:02:01.859> the<00:02:02.039> front<00:02:02.279> or<00:02:02.489> the<00:02:02.609> side<00:02:02.639> view<00:02:03.059> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
either the front or the side view so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.879 
either the front or the side view so
right<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.719> I'll<00:02:03.809> just<00:02:03.840> crop<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> front<00:02:04.709> view

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
right here I'll just crop the front view

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.429 
right here I'll just crop the front view
and<00:02:05.159> I'll<00:02:05.459> save<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:05.909> out<00:02:06.239> as<00:02:06.689> its<00:02:06.959> own<00:02:07.109> image

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and I'll save that out as its own image

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.709 
and I'll save that out as its own image
and<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.189> can<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.549> history<00:02:09.179> menu<00:02:09.539> on

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:09.719 
and then I can use my history menu on

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.720 
and then I can use my history menu on
the<00:02:09.840> right<00:02:10.019> here<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.409> step<00:02:10.769> back<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.610> the

to save these it as higher resolution as

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.120 
to save these it as higher resolution as
possible<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.630> I'll<00:02:18.720> use<00:02:18.900> JPEG<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.830> reduce

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
possible and I'll use JPEG to reduce

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.370 
possible and I'll use JPEG to reduce
file<00:02:20.430> size<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.990> jump<00:02:22.230> into

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
now my image planes are ready to go so I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.920 
now my image planes are ready to go so I
can<00:03:52.799> begin<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.519> character<00:03:53.970> modeling<00:03:54.390> process

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
can begin the character modeling process

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.810 
can begin the character modeling process
and<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.709> watch<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.160> video<00:03:56.430> where<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.730> use

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
and you can watch the video where I use

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.030 
and you can watch the video where I use
these<00:03:57.480> image<00:03:57.930> planes<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.410> create<00:03:58.739> this

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
these image planes to create this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.120 
these image planes to create this
character<00:03:59.400> here
