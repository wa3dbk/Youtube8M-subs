00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
watch and missouri you usually have an

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180 
watch and missouri you usually have an
uphill<00:00:32.969> battle<00:00:33.200> seems<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.500> forums<00:00:34.890> people

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
uphill battle seems on the forums people

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.520 
uphill battle seems on the forums people
think<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:36.390> Terran<00:00:37.020> met<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.410> be

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
think that because Terran met can be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.220 
think that because Terran met can be
just<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:37.890> powerful<00:00:38.550> against<00:00:39.120> zerg<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.170> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
just so powerful against zerg and so it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
just so powerful against zerg and so it
really<00:00:40.320> has<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> stick<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> strong

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
really has to stick to a strong

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
really has to stick to a strong
harassment<00:00:42.540> game<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> some<00:00:43.050> tricks<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.980> keep

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
harassment game in some tricks to keep

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.979 
harassment game in some tricks to keep
up<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> Terran<00:00:44.879> players<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.360> what

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
up with the Terran players is what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.709 
up with the Terran players is what
people<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.500> yeah<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> think<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.510> he'll

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
people think yeah I think it up he'll

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
people think yeah I think it up he'll
have<00:00:48.920> uphill<00:00:49.920> battle<00:00:50.309> happens<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.030> know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
have uphill battle happens when you know

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
have uphill battle happens when you know
desert<00:00:51.420> spawns<00:00:51.840> next<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> Terran<00:00:53.250> player

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
desert spawns next to the Terran player

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
desert spawns next to the Terran player
because<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:53.910> such<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> close<00:00:54.660> bond<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
because it's such a close bond the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
because it's such a close bond the
distance<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:56.070> close<00:00:56.309> yeah<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.059> see

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
distance is very close yeah you can see

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
distance is very close yeah you can see
this<00:00:57.390> distance<00:00:57.840> between<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.530> third<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
this distance between the third and the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.310 
this distance between the third and the
Terran<00:00:59.430> base<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.820> relatively<00:01:00.420> close<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.170> looks

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
Terran base is relatively close it looks

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260 
Terran base is relatively close it looks
like<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> Zerg<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.120> an

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
build because there's four spawn
positions<00:01:35.340> chances<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.299> going

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
positions chances are they're not going

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810

to<00:01:36.540> scout<00:01:37.229> each<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:37.950> case<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
to scout each other but in this case it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.520 
to scout each other but in this case it
was<00:01:38.939> different<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.320> just

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
was different because you know we just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.819 
was different because you know we just
happened<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.040> spawning<00:01:41.729> chiller<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.829> SCV

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
happened to be spawning chiller so SCV
when<00:01:43.979> she's<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.579> annoying

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
when she's going with that annoying

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.109 
when she's going with that annoying
attacking<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:47.130> spawning<00:01:47.520> pool<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
attacking of the spawning pool and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.580 
attacking of the spawning pool and
that's<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.780> he's<00:01:48.930> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> pick<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's like he's going to pick on a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 
that's like he's going to pick on a
drone<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.630> pretty<00:01:51.630> standard<00:01:51.899> her<00:01:52.229> ass

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
drone right now pretty standard her ass

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170 
drone right now pretty standard her ass
from<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> 10<00:01:52.890> pairs<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.430> looks<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
from the 10 pairs but looks like the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
from the 10 pairs but looks like the
Zerg<00:01:54.509> player<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:54.960> paying<00:01:55.560> attention<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Zerg player is not paying attention to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.959 
Zerg player is not paying attention to
it<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.290> he's<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.469> take<00:01:58.890> out<00:01:59.250> Jake's<00:01:59.729> down

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it and he's gonna take out Jake's down

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.959 
it and he's gonna take out Jake's down
the<00:02:00.149> drone<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.890> juice<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the drone actually and then juice is

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.300 
the drone actually and then juice is
actually<00:02:03.390> doing<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> extractor<00:02:04.619> trick<00:02:05.009> it's

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually doing the extractor trick it's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.130 
actually doing the extractor trick it's
not<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.729> much<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.030> trick<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.390> building<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
not so much of a trick but building it

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.510 
not so much of a trick but building it
in<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.320> opponent's<00:02:07.710> base<00:02:07.829> getting<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> little

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
in your opponent's base getting a little

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.749 
in your opponent's base getting a little
extra<00:02:09.000> vision

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
extra vision

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.130 
extra vision
and<00:02:09.879> seeing<00:02:10.330> what<00:02:10.509> they're<00:02:10.629> doing<00:02:10.899> and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and seeing what they're doing and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.809 
and seeing what they're doing and
denying<00:02:11.769> them<00:02:12.010> some<00:02:12.220> gas<00:02:12.400> if<00:02:12.640> they're<00:02:12.730> going

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
denying them some gas if they're going

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.610 
denying them some gas if they're going
to<00:02:12.909> go<00:02:13.000> with<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> tech<00:02:13.360> build<00:02:13.569> yeah<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.470> really

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to go with the tech build yeah it really

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.850 
to go with the tech build yeah it really
puts<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> parent<00:02:15.700> behind<00:02:16.329> in<00:02:16.689> in<00:02:17.140> tech<00:02:17.409> when

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
puts the parent behind in in tech when

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.140 
puts the parent behind in in tech when
you<00:02:18.069> you<00:02:18.519> know<00:02:18.549> limit<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.390> gas<00:02:19.930> intake<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
you you know limit the gas intake if you

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.240 
you you know limit the gas intake if you
block<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.689> it<00:02:23.140> only<00:02:23.230> costs<00:02:23.530> 75<00:02:23.920> minerals

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
block it and it only costs 75 minerals

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.309 
block it and it only costs 75 minerals
for<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.489> service<00:02:24.760> yeah<00:02:25.569> it's<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.959> big

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
for the service yeah it's not a big

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.309 
for the service yeah it's not a big
economic<00:02:27.209> deal<00:02:28.209> for<00:02:28.420> deserting<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.780> do<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
economic deal for deserting to do that a

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.750 
economic deal for deserting to do that a
lot<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.709> times<00:02:29.890> you'll<00:02:30.040> see<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> dirty<00:02:30.579> player

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
lot of times you'll see a dirty player

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.069 
lot of times you'll see a dirty player
build<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> extractor<00:02:31.659> than<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:31.959> it's

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
build the extractor than when it's

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.750 
build the extractor than when it's
supposed<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.349> finish<00:02:32.530> cancel<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.190> scout

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
supposed to finish cancel it scout

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.009 
supposed to finish cancel it scout
around<00:02:33.879> with<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> drone<00:02:34.360> some<00:02:34.569> more<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.959> then

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
around with the drone some more and then

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.559 
around with the drone some more and then
go<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:35.859> build<00:02:36.040> another<00:02:36.280> extractor<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.420> what

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
go and build another extractor so what

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.809 
go and build another extractor so what
i'm<00:02:37.659> doing<00:02:37.900> here<00:02:38.109> is<00:02:38.170> building<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:39.400> barracks

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
i'm doing here is building a to barracks

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.610 
i'm doing here is building a to barracks
before<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.239> refinery<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.959> very<00:02:41.140> early

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
before do refinery it's the very early

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.149 
before do refinery it's the very early
aggressive<00:02:41.980> push<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.579> like<00:02:42.760> aggression<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:44.159> by

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
aggressive push I like aggression and by

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.500 
aggressive push I like aggression and by
building<00:02:45.310> two<00:02:45.609> beds<00:02:45.819> before<00:02:46.000> they'll<00:02:46.269> be<00:02:46.329> fine

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
building two beds before they'll be fine

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.699 
building two beds before they'll be fine
I<00:02:46.540> could<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.170> lot<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.500> Marines

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
I could really get a lot of Marines

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.830 
I could really get a lot of Marines
actually<00:02:48.370> push<00:02:48.579> out<00:02:48.819> really<00:02:49.239> with<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> really

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
actually push out really with a really

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.270 
actually push out really with a really
strong<00:02:50.019> push<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.440> possibly<00:02:50.799> win<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.099> game

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
strong push and possibly win the game

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.059 
strong push and possibly win the game
and<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:52.180> looks<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.510> juice<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.920> with<00:02:54.010> a

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
and it looks like juice is going with a

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.550 
and it looks like juice is going with a
single<00:02:54.459> basis<00:02:55.060> earned<00:02:55.209> build<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.750> little<00:02:56.319> bit

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
single basis earned build a little bit

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800 
single basis earned build a little bit
defensive<00:02:57.190> um<00:02:57.489> don't<00:02:58.120> know<00:02:58.239> if<00:02:58.329> he's<00:02:58.450> gonna<00:02:58.599> go

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
defensive um don't know if he's gonna go

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.170 
defensive um don't know if he's gonna go
looks<00:02:59.290> like<00:02:59.470> he<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.099> getting<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.700> link<00:03:00.909> speed

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
looks like he is getting the link speed

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.479 
looks like he is getting the link speed
upgrade<00:03:01.629> but<00:03:02.230> he<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.650> still<00:03:02.889> continuing<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
upgrade but he is still continuing to

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.280 
upgrade but he is still continuing to
get<00:03:03.579> a<00:03:03.609> lot<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.790> gas<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.450> might<00:03:04.659> go<00:03:04.989> for

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
get a lot of gas so that might go for

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.220 
get a lot of gas so that might go for
roaches<00:03:05.920> or<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> baneling<00:03:06.670> build<00:03:07.150> not<00:03:07.750> exactly

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
roaches or a baneling build not exactly

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.119 
roaches or a baneling build not exactly
sure<00:03:08.319> yet<00:03:09.090> yeah<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.599> because<00:03:11.049> my<00:03:11.319> gas<00:03:11.889> was

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
sure yet yeah like because my gas was

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.199 
sure yet yeah like because my gas was
blocked<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.549> couldn't<00:03:12.790> do<00:03:12.940> anything

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
blocked so I couldn't do anything

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.900 
blocked so I couldn't do anything
fantasy<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:14.079> terms<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.709> pecking<00:03:15.430> that's

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
fantasy in terms of like pecking that's

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.819 
fantasy in terms of like pecking that's
why<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.060> decided<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:16.660> go<00:03:16.840> for<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.079> push<00:03:17.349> instead

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
why I decided to go for a push instead

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.289 
why I decided to go for a push instead
all<00:03:18.519> right<00:03:18.669> I'm<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.940> clearing<00:03:19.150> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
all right I'm just clearing the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.180 
all right I'm just clearing the
extractor<00:03:20.079> finally<00:03:20.410> goes<00:03:20.620> down<00:03:20.650> takes

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
extractor finally goes down takes

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.640

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
small numbers and suv wretched is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.610 
small numbers and suv wretched is
talking<00:03:28.269> about<00:03:28.419> going<00:03:28.989> with<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:29.319> marines

talking about going with the marines
early<00:03:30.040> because<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.459> couldn't<00:03:30.669> get<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.819> double

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
early because you couldn't get a double

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.369 
early because you couldn't get a double
refinery<00:03:31.540> that's<00:03:31.930> something<00:03:32.109> that's<00:03:32.260> really

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
refinery that's something that's really

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.020 
refinery that's something that's really
important<00:03:32.949> in<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.099> lot<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.280> builds<00:03:33.699> if<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.879> want

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
important in a lot of builds if you want

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.360 
important in a lot of builds if you want
that<00:03:34.090> flexibility<00:03:34.930> those<00:03:35.230> options<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.919> you

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
that flexibility those options of you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.770 
that flexibility those options of you
know<00:03:36.459> if<00:03:36.669> this<00:03:36.910> happens<00:03:37.329> then<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:37.629> going<00:03:37.750> to

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
know if this happens then I'm going to

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.599 
know if this happens then I'm going to
do<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.139> but<00:03:38.590> if<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.949> happens<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.519> I'm

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
do this but if that happens that I'm

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.189 
do this but if that happens that I'm
going<00:03:39.699> to<00:03:39.760> do<00:03:39.879> something<00:03:40.090> else<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.049> in

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
going to do something else and so in

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.020 
going to do something else and so in
this<00:03:41.290> case<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.680> know<00:03:41.709> denied<00:03:42.099> gas<00:03:42.430> I'm<00:03:42.730> going

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
this case you know denied gas I'm going

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.250 
this case you know denied gas I'm going
to<00:03:43.090> go<00:03:43.180> some<00:03:43.389> strong<00:03:43.629> marines<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.139> can

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
to go some strong marines and you can

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.900 
to go some strong marines and you can
see<00:03:44.379> he<00:03:44.590> was<00:03:44.769> supply<00:03:45.099> blocked<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.639> early

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
see he was supply blocked a little early

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.050 
see he was supply blocked a little early
so<00:03:46.120> he<00:03:46.299> use<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.129> orbital<00:03:48.129> command<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.639> drop

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
so he use that orbital command to drop

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.360 
so he use that orbital command to drop
an<00:03:49.239> extra<00:03:49.599> supply<00:03:49.780> boost<00:03:50.169> on<00:03:50.620> his<00:03:51.040> supply

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
an extra supply boost on his supply

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.460 
an extra supply boost on his supply
depot<00:03:51.669> it's<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.510> best<00:03:52.629> economic<00:03:53.290> move

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
depot it's not the best economic move

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.259 
depot it's not the best economic move
because<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.829> mule<00:03:54.159> over<00:03:54.579> time<00:03:54.790> we'll<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.120> more

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
because a mule over time we'll get more

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.300 
because a mule over time we'll get more
minerals<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.199> the<00:03:56.590> short<00:03:56.769> term<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.040> can

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
minerals but in the short term it can

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.099 
minerals but in the short term it can
help<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:57.579> boost<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.120> get<00:03:58.599> out<00:03:58.750> for<00:03:58.930> an<00:03:58.989> early

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
help you boost and get out for an early

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.569 
help you boost and get out for an early

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
there they are a good meat shield for

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.949 
there they are a good meat shield for
those<00:04:09.579> Marines<00:04:09.970> helping<00:04:10.359> those<00:04:10.510> Marines<00:04:10.780> stay

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
those Marines helping those Marines stay

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.899 
those Marines helping those Marines stay
in<00:04:11.049> that<00:04:11.199> ball<00:04:11.379> and<00:04:11.560> stay<00:04:11.709> protected<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.400> you

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
in that ball and stay protected and you

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.180 
in that ball and stay protected and you
can<00:04:13.030> see<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.419> that<00:04:13.599> SCB<00:04:14.319> rush<00:04:14.500> actually<00:04:14.979> has<00:04:15.159> a

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
can see to that SCB rush actually has a

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.550 
can see to that SCB rush actually has a
harvester<00:04:15.819> advantage<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.570> he<00:04:17.139> doesn't<00:04:17.289> know

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
harvester advantage so he doesn't know

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.649 
harvester advantage so he doesn't know
it<00:04:17.769> her<00:04:18.099> study<00:04:18.340> but<00:04:18.519> actually<00:04:19.209> bringing<00:04:19.450> these

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
it her study but actually bringing these

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.420 
it her study but actually bringing these
SUVs<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> fight<00:04:20.680> isn't<00:04:20.950> ham

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
SUVs to the fight isn't ham

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.180 
SUVs to the fight isn't ham

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
economy and you can see with mules turns

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.129 
economy and you can see with mules turns
are<00:04:24.400> able<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.789> keep<00:04:25.000> an<00:04:25.240> economic<00:04:25.750> advantage

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
are able to keep an economic advantage

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.629 
are able to keep an economic advantage
yeah<00:04:26.259> building<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.650> bunker<00:04:27.009> I<00:04:27.190> love<00:04:27.430> building

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
yeah building a bunker I love building

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.400 
yeah building a bunker I love building
bunkers<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.120> observe<00:04:28.570> basis<00:04:28.990> or<00:04:29.139> next<00:04:29.350> to

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
bunkers and observe basis or next to

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.930 
bunkers and observe basis or next to
third<00:04:29.560> base<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.949> have<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.190> position<00:04:30.639> because

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
third base is to have a position because

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.909 
third base is to have a position because
if<00:04:31.030> I'm<00:04:31.150> not<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.330> position<00:04:31.750> then<00:04:32.440> I'm<00:04:32.710> really

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
if I'm not a position then I'm really

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.340 
if I'm not a position then I'm really
screwed<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.669> can<00:04:33.820> see<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.270> brooch<00:04:35.110> and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
screwed and you can see the brooch and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.480 
screwed and you can see the brooch and
the<00:04:35.530> links<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.070> have<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.280> get<00:04:36.340> that

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the links really have to get that

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.129 
the links really have to get that
surround<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.030> SUV<00:04:37.360> misspeaks<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.750> nice<00:04:37.900> form

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
surround but SUV misspeaks a nice form

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.140 
surround but SUV misspeaks a nice form
but<00:04:38.560> they<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:38.710> take<00:04:39.100> out<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.400> SUV<00:04:39.759> building<00:04:40.090> a

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
but they do take out the SUV building a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.730 
but they do take out the SUV building a
bunker<00:04:40.449> and<00:04:40.600> that's<00:04:40.870> probably<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
bunker and that's probably going to

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.040 
bunker and that's probably going to
secure<00:04:42.130> this<00:04:42.310> very<00:04:42.610> victory<00:04:43.389> in<00:04:43.539> this<00:04:43.660> battle

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
secure this very victory in this battle

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.600 
secure this very victory in this battle
especially<00:04:44.500> with<00:04:44.889> these<00:04:45.009> three<00:04:45.250> roaches<00:04:45.580> in

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
especially with these three roaches in

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.219 
especially with these three roaches in
the<00:04:45.729> back<00:04:45.880> roaches<00:04:46.300> just<00:04:46.479> eat<00:04:46.690> up<00:04:46.900> Marines

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
the back roaches just eat up Marines

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.770 
the back roaches just eat up Marines

right now oh you see a blood transfusion

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.659 
right now oh you see a blood transfusion
on<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:55.930> drones<00:04:56.229> what<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> good<00:04:56.830> microbe<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.340> do

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
on the drones what a good microbe I do

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.550 
on the drones what a good microbe I do
so<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.210> do<00:04:58.389> not<00:04:58.419> often<00:04:58.960> see<00:04:59.259> a<00:04:59.289> blood

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
so that you do not often see a blood

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.770 
so that you do not often see a blood
transfusion<00:04:59.710> on<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.220> drone<00:05:00.910> because<00:05:01.630> it's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
transfusion on a drone because it's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.450 
transfusion on a drone because it's
about<00:05:01.990> three<00:05:02.289> times<00:05:02.470> like<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.979> drone<00:05:03.160> but

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
about three times like the drone but

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.150 
about three times like the drone but
that<00:05:04.060> is<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.210> good<00:05:04.419> me<00:05:04.509> if<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.840> need<00:05:04.960> that

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that is a good me if you need that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.980 
that is a good me if you need that
economy<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.729> can<00:05:06.849> see<00:05:07.030> bringing<00:05:07.539> in<00:05:07.660> for

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
economy and you can see bringing in for

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.290 
economy and you can see bringing in for
SUVs<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.310> attack<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.820> having<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> solid

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
SUVs on that attack and having a solid

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.080 
SUVs on that attack and having a solid
attack<00:05:10.660> kept<00:05:11.410> a<00:05:11.620> harvester<00:05:12.520> advantage<00:05:12.910> for

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
attack kept a harvester advantage for

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.189 
attack kept a harvester advantage for
the<00:05:13.150> champ<00:05:13.360> later<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.750> that's<00:05:13.900> something<00:05:14.080> for

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
the champ later so that's something for

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.140 
the champ later so that's something for
Chan<00:05:14.800> players<00:05:15.099> to<00:05:15.220> think<00:05:15.430> about<00:05:15.639> when<00:05:16.060> you

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
Chan players to think about when you

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.450 
Chan players to think about when you
bring<00:05:16.419> in<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.810> STDs<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> attack<00:05:17.889> you're

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
bring in the STDs to the attack you're

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.820 
bring in the STDs to the attack you're
not<00:05:18.639> necessarily<00:05:19.240> losing<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.349> harvester

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
not necessarily losing a harvester

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.050 
not necessarily losing a harvester
advantage<00:05:21.130> you<00:05:21.220> could<00:05:21.400> be<00:05:21.520> actually

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
advantage you could be actually

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.060 
advantage you could be actually
benefiting<00:05:22.599> yourself<00:05:22.930> by<00:05:23.110> allowing<00:05:23.680> yourself

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
benefiting yourself by allowing yourself

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.680 
benefiting yourself by allowing yourself
to<00:05:24.099> stay<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.759> base<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.150> do<00:05:25.240> more<00:05:25.479> damage

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
to stay in that base and do more damage

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.950 
to stay in that base and do more damage
than<00:05:25.960> you<00:05:26.050> kill<00:05:26.500> a<00:05:26.530> baby<00:05:26.710> like<00:05:27.190> 34<00:05:27.880> drones<00:05:28.180> to

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
than you kill a baby like 34 drones to

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.140 
than you kill a baby like 34 drones to
for<00:05:29.199> drones<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.590> think<00:05:29.830> yeah<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:31.000> pretty

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
for drones I think yeah and pretty

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.089 
for drones I think yeah and pretty
powerful<00:05:31.510> having<00:05:32.050> those<00:05:32.139> SUVs<00:05:32.380> take<00:05:32.919> those

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
powerful having those SUVs take those

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.830 
powerful having those SUVs take those
early<00:05:33.400> hits<00:05:33.580> keeps<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:34.000> Marines<00:05:34.240> alive<00:05:34.510> we<00:05:34.720> do

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
early hits keeps the Marines alive we do

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.320 
early hits keeps the Marines alive we do
more<00:05:35.050> damage<00:05:35.289> and<00:05:35.789> can<00:05:36.789> stand<00:05:37.000> there<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.180> just

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
more damage and can stand there and just

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.550 
more damage and can stand there and just
punish<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.780> dirty<00:05:37.990> player<00:05:38.169> for<00:05:38.409> a<00:05:38.440> little

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
punish that dirty player for a little

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.370 
punish that dirty player for a little
longer<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:39.970> reduces<00:05:40.599> looking<00:05:41.110> like<00:05:41.229> he's

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
longer so this reduces looking like he's

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.080 
longer so this reduces looking like he's
in<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.590> good<00:05:41.740> position<00:05:41.919> right<00:05:42.250> now<00:05:42.430> he's<00:05:42.820> got

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
in a good position right now he's got

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.730 
in a good position right now he's got
some<00:05:43.330> roaches<00:05:43.659> roaches<00:05:44.080> our<00:05:44.199> great<00:05:44.440> counter

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
some roaches roaches our great counter

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.950 
some roaches roaches our great counter
for<00:05:44.919> Marines<00:05:45.159> and<00:05:45.400> if<00:05:45.880> SUV<00:05:46.300> rush<00:05:46.479> can't<00:05:46.780> get

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
for Marines and if SUV rush can't get

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.830 
for Marines and if SUV rush can't get
tanks<00:05:47.320> up<00:05:47.470> too<00:05:48.220> soon<00:05:48.490> then<00:05:48.789> you<00:05:49.150> know<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.659> Zerg

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
tanks up too soon then you know the Zerg

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.300 
tanks up too soon then you know the Zerg
player<00:05:50.080> gets<00:05:50.500> himself<00:05:50.650> in<00:05:50.919> an<00:05:51.039> advantageous

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
player gets himself in an advantageous

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.089 
player gets himself in an advantageous
position<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.300> is<00:05:52.509> expanding<00:05:53.050> right<00:05:53.560> now<00:05:53.710> but

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
position and is expanding right now but

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.560 
position and is expanding right now but
it<00:05:54.220> looks<00:05:54.400> like<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.699> chance<00:05:54.940> trying<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.389> match

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
it looks like the chance trying to match

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.050 
it looks like the chance trying to match
that<00:05:55.599> with<00:05:56.500> those<00:05:56.680> nice<00:05:56.949> command<00:05:57.669> centers<00:05:57.940> I

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
that with those nice command centers I

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.480 
that with those nice command centers I
can<00:05:58.210> lift<00:05:58.419> off<00:05:58.630> and<00:05:58.960> then<00:05:59.139> it's<00:05:59.440> been<00:05:59.710> without

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
can lift off and then it's been without

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.399 
can lift off and then it's been without
having<00:06:00.849> to<00:06:00.940> build<00:06:01.120> out<00:06:01.449> there<00:06:01.780> in<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.050> risky
