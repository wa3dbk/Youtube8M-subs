answer yes and I'm gonna explain what

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.460 
answer yes and I'm gonna explain what
now<00:03:51.569> when<00:03:51.720> you're<00:03:51.840> playing<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.230> crucible

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
now when you're playing in the crucible

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.680 
now when you're playing in the crucible
there<00:03:52.859> are<00:03:53.010> various<00:03:53.609> ways<00:03:53.639> to<00:03:54.209> play<00:03:54.419> however

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
there are various ways to play however

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.259 
there are various ways to play however
when<00:03:55.200> using<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.620> scout<00:03:55.980> rifle<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.879> should<00:03:57.090> play

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
when using a scout rifle you should play

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.720 
when using a scout rifle you should play
passively<00:03:57.780> lock<00:03:58.440> down<00:03:58.650> an<00:03:58.829> area<00:03:59.220> with<00:03:59.459> long

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
passively lock down an area with long

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.759 
passively lock down an area with long
lines<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.239> sight<00:04:00.419> because<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.260> long-range

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
lines of sight because it's a long-range

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.699 
lines of sight because it's a long-range
weapon<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.489> it's<00:04:02.609> not<00:04:02.940> great<00:04:03.359> up<00:04:03.599> close<00:04:04.079> now<00:04:04.680> I

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
weapon and it's not great up close now I

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.470 
weapon and it's not great up close now I
had<00:04:04.950> equip<00:04:05.220> any<00:04:05.459> scout<00:04:05.879> rifle<00:04:06.120> with<00:04:06.450> a

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
had equip any scout rifle with a

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.720 
had equip any scout rifle with a
close-range<00:04:06.989> secondary<00:04:07.739> personally<00:04:08.280> I'd<00:04:08.459> use

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
close-range secondary personally I'd use

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.629 
close-range secondary personally I'd use
a<00:04:08.760> shotgun<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.840> let's<00:04:10.500> talk<00:04:10.739> about<00:04:10.799> outlaw<00:04:11.489> and

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
a shotgun so let's talk about outlaw and

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.610 
a shotgun so let's talk about outlaw and
fireflight<00:04:12.389> when<00:04:12.599> playing<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.079> crucial<00:04:13.379> game

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
fireflight when playing a crucial game

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.729 
fireflight when playing a crucial game
both<00:04:14.459> these<00:04:14.699> require<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.480> precision<00:04:16.049> kill<00:04:16.229> so

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
both these require a precision kill so

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.589 
both these require a precision kill so
they<00:04:16.889> fall<00:04:17.160> hand<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.729> hand<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.389> get<00:04:18.570> a

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
they fall hand in hand and you get a

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:20.420 
they fall hand in hand and you get a
precision<00:04:19.049> kill<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.440> one<00:04:19.709> player<00:04:20.010> they

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
precision kill on one player they

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.969 
precision kill on one player they
explode<00:04:20.909> and<00:04:21.120> deal<00:04:21.510> damage<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.200> people<00:04:22.590> around

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
explode and deal damage to people around

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.590 
explode and deal damage to people around
them<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.240> get<00:04:24.450> a<00:04:24.479> fast<00:04:24.900> reload<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
them and you get a fast reload and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.240 
them and you get a fast reload and
obviously<00:04:25.990> when<00:04:26.110> playing<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.380> crucible<00:04:26.860> you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
obviously when playing the crucible you

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.480 
obviously when playing the crucible you
always<00:04:27.700> go<00:04:28.000> for<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> head<00:04:28.660> shot<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.200> hope<00:04:29.710> now

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
always go for a head shot I hope now

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.760 
always go for a head shot I hope now
let's<00:04:31.090> talk<00:04:31.300> about<00:04:31.360> higher<00:04:31.900> caliber<00:04:32.440> rounds

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
let's talk about higher caliber rounds

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
let's talk about higher caliber rounds
again<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.700> no-brainer<00:04:34.150> for<00:04:34.690> me

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
again this is a no-brainer for me

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.660 
again this is a no-brainer for me
personally<00:04:35.290> they<00:04:35.680> cause<00:04:35.920> your<00:04:36.160> enemy<00:04:36.520> to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
personally they cause your enemy to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.370 
personally they cause your enemy to
stagger<00:04:36.970> making<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.420> very<00:04:37.630> difficult<00:04:37.780> for

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
stagger making it very difficult for

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.620 
stagger making it very difficult for
them<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.160> accurate<00:04:39.400> against<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.180> now<00:04:40.360> you

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
them to be accurate against you now you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.620 
them to be accurate against you now you
could<00:04:41.020> opt<00:04:41.260> for<00:04:41.710> hammer<00:04:41.950> forged<00:04:42.310> or

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
could opt for hammer forged or

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.030 
could opt for hammer forged or
armor-piercing<00:04:43.630> rounds<00:04:43.900> but<00:04:44.290> I'd<00:04:44.530> say<00:04:44.860> on

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
armor-piercing rounds but I'd say on

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.340 
armor-piercing rounds but I'd say on
this<00:04:45.280> weapon<00:04:45.520> these<00:04:46.180> aren't<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.810> best<00:04:46.990> choice

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
this weapon these aren't the best choice

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.740 
this weapon these aren't the best choice
hundred<00:04:47.920> percent<00:04:48.310> go<00:04:48.670> against<00:04:49.060> hammer<00:04:49.420> forge

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
hundred percent go against hammer forge

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.690 
hundred percent go against hammer forge
the<00:04:50.170> range<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.680> already<00:04:50.860> three<00:04:51.220> quarters<00:04:51.640> of

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
the range is already three quarters of

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.700 
the range is already three quarters of
the<00:04:51.850> way<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.210> armor<00:04:52.810> piercing<00:04:53.020> rounds<00:04:53.260> well

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
the way and armor piercing rounds well

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.740 
the way and armor piercing rounds well
you<00:04:53.890> could<00:04:54.100> go<00:04:54.280> for<00:04:54.520> them<00:04:54.640> but<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.090> haven't<00:04:55.510> been

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
you could go for them but I haven't been

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.050 
you could go for them but I haven't been
able<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.500> test<00:04:56.710> these<00:04:56.920> out<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.610> have<00:04:57.820> heard

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
able to test these out and I have heard

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.720 
able to test these out and I have heard
that<00:04:58.120> these<00:04:58.510> do<00:04:58.780> not<00:04:58.810> pierce<00:04:59.530> walls<00:04:59.890> like<00:05:00.550> the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
that these do not pierce walls like the

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.080 
that these do not pierce walls like the
ldr<00:05:01.360> does<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.900> i<00:05:02.080> would<00:05:02.350> definitely<00:05:02.860> opt<00:05:03.280> for

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
ldr does so i would definitely opt for

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.810 
ldr does so i would definitely opt for
the<00:05:04.420> high<00:05:04.810> caliber<00:05:05.320> rounds<00:05:05.680> so<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.250> can<00:05:06.550> stay

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the high caliber rounds so you can stay

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.910 
the high caliber rounds so you can stay
your<00:05:07.060> targets<00:05:07.540> making<00:05:08.020> them<00:05:08.170> less<00:05:08.320> accurate

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
your targets making them less accurate

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.880 
your targets making them less accurate
against<00:05:09.460> you<00:05:09.750> again<00:05:10.750> I'm<00:05:10.990> not<00:05:11.020> too<00:05:11.440> sure<00:05:11.710> if

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
against you again I'm not too sure if

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.610 
against you again I'm not too sure if
the<00:05:12.520> armor-piercing<00:05:13.060> rounds<00:05:13.510> do<00:05:13.720> penetrate

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
the armor-piercing rounds do penetrate

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.310 
the armor-piercing rounds do penetrate
through<00:05:14.800> walls<00:05:15.130> like<00:05:15.760> they<00:05:15.970> do<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.660> LDR<00:05:17.170> I

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
through walls like they do on the LDR I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.350 
through walls like they do on the LDR I
am<00:05:17.440> aware<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.010> ldi<00:05:18.340> can<00:05:18.730> shoot<00:05:19.150> through

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
am aware that the ldi can shoot through
