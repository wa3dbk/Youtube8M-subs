played you before what would they be

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.950 
played you before what would they be
probably<00:00:46.950> reactive<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.239> adaptive<00:00:48.719> that's

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
probably reactive and adaptive that's

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.510 
probably reactive and adaptive that's
pretty<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.219> try<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pretty much what I do I just try to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
pretty much what I do I just try to
react<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.000> everyone<00:00:51.300> does<00:00:51.600> try<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> adapt

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
react to what everyone does try to adapt

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
react to what everyone does try to adapt
to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> situation<00:00:53.270> that's<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> gist<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to the situation that's the gist of it I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
to the situation that's the gist of it I
don't<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> set<00:00:55.770> style<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.340> depends

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
don't have a set style it just depends

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
don't have a set style it just depends
on<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:56.850> opponent<00:01:00.109> may<00:01:01.109> later<00:01:01.289> bro<00:01:01.559> melee<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
on my opponent may later bro melee and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.080 
on my opponent may later bro melee and
brawl

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
brawl

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.109 
brawl
Nathan<00:01:03.750> bro<00:01:03.870> uh<00:01:03.899> like<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.979> said<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.400> reactive

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
Nathan bro uh like I said it's reactive

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.580 
Nathan bro uh like I said it's reactive
and<00:01:06.240> adaptive<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> depends<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.320> who<00:01:07.470> my

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and adaptive so it depends on who my

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
and adaptive so it depends on who my
opponent<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> favorite

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
opponent is I don't have a favorite

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.120

stage<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.420> either<00:01:10.049> game<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.740> depends<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
stage on either game it just depends on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.490 
stage on either game it just depends on
who<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.310> fighting<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:12.290> what<00:01:13.290> made<00:01:13.409> you
