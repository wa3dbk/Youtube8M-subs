after playing the ps3 version so I had
the<00:01:24.020> console<00:01:24.380> version<00:01:24.710> fresh<00:01:25.010> in<00:01:25.190> my<00:01:25.310> mind

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
the console version fresh in my mind

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.640 
the console version fresh in my mind
when<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.090> went<00:01:26.390> into<00:01:26.480> this<00:01:26.660> one<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.320> can<00:01:27.500> tell

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650

when I went into this one and I can tell
you<00:01:27.890> although<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.730> quality<00:01:28.910> gap<00:01:29.300> is<00:01:29.480> still

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
you although the quality gap is still

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.480 
you although the quality gap is still
there<00:01:29.900> it's<00:01:30.440> nowhere<00:01:30.620> near<00:01:30.770> as<00:01:31.010> wide<00:01:31.280> as<00:01:31.460> it

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
there it's nowhere near as wide as it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.040 
there it's nowhere near as wide as it
used<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:31.850> be<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.390> can<00:01:32.510> tell<00:01:32.690> they've<00:01:32.840> taken

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
used to be you can tell they've taken

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.170 
used to be you can tell they've taken
some<00:01:33.350> serious<00:01:33.620> strides<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.310> close<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.760> and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
some serious strides to close it and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.820 
some serious strides to close it and
they've<00:01:35.300> done<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.540> pretty<00:01:35.600> good<00:01:35.870> job<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.620> much

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
they've done a pretty good job so much

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.440 
they've done a pretty good job so much
so<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:37.610> you're<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.180> handheld

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
so that if you're more of a handheld

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.570 
so that if you're more of a handheld
person<00:01:38.960> I'd<00:01:39.440> have<00:01:39.680> no<00:01:39.890> problem<00:01:39.920> recommending

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
person I'd have no problem recommending

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.870 
person I'd have no problem recommending
this<00:01:41.150> one<00:01:41.390> still<00:01:41.930> not<00:01:42.080> as<00:01:42.230> good<00:01:42.470> but<00:01:42.770> also<00:01:43.490> not

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
this one still not as good but also not

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.970 
this one still not as good but also not
as<00:01:44.000> bad<00:01:44.210> as<00:01:44.540> handheld<00:01:45.020> Lego<00:01:45.200> games<00:01:45.470> have<00:01:45.710> been

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
as bad as handheld Lego games have been

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.030 
as bad as handheld Lego games have been
so<00:01:46.880> obviously<00:01:47.390> Lego<00:01:47.960> The<00:01:48.170> Hobbit<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.620> based<00:01:48.860> on

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
so obviously Lego The Hobbit is based on

so obviously Lego The Hobbit is based on
the<00:01:49.130> first<00:01:49.340> two<00:01:49.460> Hobbit<00:01:49.940> movies<00:01:50.240> we've

different in terms of feel and design

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.960 
different in terms of feel and design
it's<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.739> core<00:03:11.010> gameplay<00:03:11.250> that's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
it's just the core gameplay that's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's just the core gameplay that's
pretty<00:03:12.390> much<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.780> same

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
pretty much the same

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.020 
pretty much the same
one<00:03:13.830> thing<00:03:14.040> that's<00:03:14.190> certainly<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.850> same

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
one thing that's certainly not the same

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.449 
one thing that's certainly not the same
as<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> presentation<00:03:16.230> on<00:03:16.440> consoles<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.280> is

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
as the presentation on consoles this is

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.699 
as the presentation on consoles this is
kind<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.300> gorgeous<00:03:18.600> game<00:03:18.930> it's<00:03:19.590> not

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
kind of a gorgeous game it's not

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.560 
kind of a gorgeous game it's not
technically<00:03:20.310> stunning<00:03:20.850> or<00:03:20.970> anything<00:03:21.180> but

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
technically stunning or anything but

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.960 
technically stunning or anything but
artistically<00:03:22.290> it's<00:03:22.799> very<00:03:23.130> pretty<00:03:23.489> on

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
artistically it's very pretty on

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.289 
artistically it's very pretty on
handhelds<00:03:24.830> not<00:03:25.830> so<00:03:26.010> much<00:03:26.220> colors<00:03:26.970> aren't<00:03:27.209> as

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
handhelds not so much colors aren't as

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.720 
handhelds not so much colors aren't as
rich<00:03:27.480> Lighting's<00:03:28.320> not<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.680> good<00:03:28.890> but<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:29.610> not

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
rich Lighting's not as good but it's not

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.300 
rich Lighting's not as good but it's not
a<00:03:29.760> bad<00:03:30.060> looking<00:03:30.420> 3ds<00:03:30.840> game<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.799> pales<00:03:32.070> in

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
a bad looking 3ds game but it pales in

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070 
a bad looking 3ds game but it pales in
comparison<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:32.970> console<00:03:33.420> version<00:03:33.690> the

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
comparison to the console version the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.300 
comparison to the console version the
same<00:03:34.260> goes<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.500> stuff<00:03:34.860> like<00:03:34.920> Sound<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.700> Music

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.559 

so<00:03:43.310> again<00:03:43.519> it's<00:03:43.910> really<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.269> matter<00:03:44.450> of

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
so again it's really a matter of

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.270 
so again it's really a matter of
preference<00:03:44.900> if<00:03:45.319> you're<00:03:45.500> looking<00:03:45.800> for<00:03:45.980> big

linear levels and shorter sessions the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.920 
linear levels and shorter sessions the
handheld<00:03:55.550> version<00:03:55.610> is<00:03:55.940> great<00:03:56.030> for<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.390> you

notorious for stagnating and repeating
itself<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.420> nice<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.870> see<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.140> Lego<00:04:03.349> games

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
itself it's nice to see the Lego games

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.320 
itself it's nice to see the Lego games
starting<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.370> address<00:04:04.700> one<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:04.910> their<00:04:05.090> biggest

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
starting to address one of their biggest

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.509 
starting to address one of their biggest
shortcomings<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.440> being<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.830> quality<00:04:07.280> gap

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
shortcomings that being the quality gap

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.250 
shortcomings that being the quality gap
that<00:04:07.730> made<00:04:07.879> their<00:04:08.060> handheld<00:04:08.330> versions<00:04:08.840> seem

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
that made their handheld versions seem

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.020 
that made their handheld versions seem
like<00:04:09.410> afterthoughts<00:04:10.069> it's<00:04:10.580> not<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.849> case

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
like afterthoughts it's not the case

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.910 
like afterthoughts it's not the case
with<00:04:11.209> this<00:04:11.330> one<00:04:11.390> now<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.080> games<00:04:12.470> still<00:04:12.709> better

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
with this one now the games still better

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.090 
with this one now the games still better
on<00:04:13.099> consoles<00:04:13.610> but<00:04:13.880> much<00:04:14.660> like<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.930> hobbit<00:04:15.230> small

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
on consoles but much like a hobbit small
