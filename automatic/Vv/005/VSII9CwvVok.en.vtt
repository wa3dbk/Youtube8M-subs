this is a demonstration of my homemade

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.559 
this is a demonstration of my homemade
solution<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.500> adjust<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.370> light<00:00:05.850> sensor<00:00:06.390> on

black bears down 9670 to whatever
setting<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.300> want<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.780> pretty<00:00:10.740> much<00:00:10.950> what

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
setting you want it to pretty much what

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.740 
setting you want it to pretty much what
it<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> phone<00:00:11.940> has<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.330> automatic

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it is is the phone has the automatic

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.539 
it is is the phone has the automatic
sensor<00:00:13.170> on<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.349> but<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:13.620> really<00:00:13.920> sensitive

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
sensor on it but it's really sensitive

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.090 
sensor on it but it's really sensitive
to<00:00:14.910> light<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.420> even<00:00:15.870> even<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.590> you're<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:16.949> in

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to light so even even if you're just in

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.279

a room with regular light bulbs or
outside<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> Sun<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.640> always<00:00:20.939> seems<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
outside in the Sun it always seems to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.240 
outside in the Sun it always seems to
want<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> brighten<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.109> screen<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> just

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
want to brighten the screen and it just

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
want to brighten the screen and it just
doesn't<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.880> an<00:00:24.000> adjustment<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.660> between

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
doesn't have an adjustment in between

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
doesn't have an adjustment in between
one<00:00:25.380> hundred<00:00:25.500> percent<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.699> minimum<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
one hundred percent or the minimum that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.060 
one hundred percent or the minimum that
you<00:00:27.240> said<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.199> only<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:28.769> the

found<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.180> piece<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> zagg<00:00:33.870> invisishield

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
found a piece of zagg invisishield

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
found a piece of zagg invisishield
screen<00:00:35.160> protector<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
screen protector it was actually a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
screen protector it was actually a
little<00:00:36.930> circular<00:00:37.320> piece<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.010> supposed

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
little circular piece that was supposed

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
little circular piece that was supposed
to<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.340> cut<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.969> different<00:00:39.329> phone<00:00:39.570> for

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to be cut out for different phone for

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.470 
to be cut out for different phone for
the<00:00:39.930> LED<00:00:40.469> flash<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.700> that's<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.239> little

actually worked really well for this

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
actually worked really well for this
right<00:00:50.579> now<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.390> phone<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.410> phone<00:00:52.469> right

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
right now the phone this phone right

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
here you can see doesn't have anything

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.180 
here you can see doesn't have anything
covering<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> light<00:00:55.020> sensor<00:00:55.469> they're<00:00:56.010> both

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
covering the light sensor they're both

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.950 
covering the light sensor they're both
set<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.640> thirty<00:00:56.910> percent<00:00:57.270> screen<00:00:57.660> brightness

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
set at thirty percent screen brightness

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
set at thirty percent screen brightness
and<00:00:58.440> obviously<00:00:59.190> adjust<00:00:59.309> auto<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.719> hundred

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
and obviously adjust auto to one hundred

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.750 
and obviously adjust auto to one hundred
percent<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.250> dark<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
percent so right now is dark in this

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
left's data there you go and the nice

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.669 
left's data there you go and the nice
thing<00:01:42.610> about<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.270> since<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.990> took<00:01:44.049> magic

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
thing about this is since I took magic

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.279 
thing about this is since I took magic
marker<00:01:45.130> instead<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.610> paint<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.929> actual

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
marker instead of paint to the actual

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.810 
marker instead of paint to the actual
screen<00:01:47.619> protector<00:01:48.189> it's<00:01:48.369> almost<00:01:48.549> like<00:01:48.700> it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
screen protector it's almost like it

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.450 
screen protector it's almost like it
tinted<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.539> if<00:01:49.689> I<00:01:49.840> am<00:01:49.990> outside<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.920> direct

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
tinted it so if I am outside and direct

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.820 
tinted it so if I am outside and direct
sunlight<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:52.179> still<00:01:52.659> works<00:01:52.929> so<00:01:53.200> we'll<00:01:53.470> adjust

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
sunlight it still works so we'll adjust

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.529 
sunlight it still works so we'll adjust
to<00:01:54.009> one<00:01:54.130> hundred<00:01:54.190> percent<00:01:54.399> but<00:01:55.149> only<00:01:55.450> in

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
to one hundred percent but only in

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.169 
to one hundred percent but only in
really<00:01:55.990> bright<00:01:56.259> conditions<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.459> just<00:01:58.090> for

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
really bright conditions so just for

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.240 
really bright conditions so just for
example<00:01:58.690> I'll<00:01:58.750> put<00:01:58.959> this<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.530> right<00:01:59.920> up<00:02:00.130> to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
example I'll put this like right up to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.520 
example I'll put this like right up to
the<00:02:00.369> phone<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:07.509> know<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:08.019> just<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.500> just

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
the phone you know see it just it just

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.270 
the phone you know see it just it just
adjusted<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:10.299> it<00:02:10.420> will<00:02:10.600> jump<00:02:10.810> back<00:02:10.899> down

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.410 

there<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.370> go<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.790> see<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.000> still<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
light on in the room which in itself was

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.370 
light on in the room which in itself was
enough<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.599> turn<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.230> light

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
covering the light sensor on this phone

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.599 
covering the light sensor on this phone
it<00:02:26.140> doesn't<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.799> when<00:02:27.100> shut<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> light<00:02:27.579> off
