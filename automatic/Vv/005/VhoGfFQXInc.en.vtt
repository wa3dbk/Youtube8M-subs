 [Music] 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.670
 i 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.539
 you are talking to them and sant boi and in this 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:23.110
 video I wanted to show you how to be able to 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.460
 run put the downloaded games 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.460
 from game gamestop end 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.260
 as you can see 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.109
 and any obviously when you 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.930
 download is to remain as always a 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.970
 folder with these files 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.500
 young see downloads let's go here and 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.270
 these files are left 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.760
 the only thing that you do not have to do 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.290
 is to select only the file 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.140
 weird this is not 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.249
 let's select close 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.249
 [Music] 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.550
 there's more 7 always almost always going to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.250
 be a low can be is also very 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.010
 important now we give you to extract here 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.100
 with all to achieve all the rare extract 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 act 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 I'll pass the video until it's over 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.259
 good 7 899 well once I'm going to put 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.670
 this more or less so that they see it from 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.150
 another way 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.230
 there 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.660
 once it is finished extracting all 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.890
 the peace files what I do if 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.350
 you want to leave all the files 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.290
 To rar those things, you, I, the truth, 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 eliminated because they are trash to me and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.070
 good they will be this file that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.960
 would be the typical iso file 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.300
 that we execute is to eliminate your 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.570
 BeltrÃ¡n 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.870
 the typical one that we execute with 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.670
 with what is the montull 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.350
 good if you do not let them erase some the 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.510
 true 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.580
 what to save me 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:09.550
 They delete them later we will create a 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.550
 new folder I will put pay day 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.060
 the file did 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.940
 we are going to extract it also in the folder 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.770
 that we create 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.770
 this procedure is faster 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.420
 obviously depending on your computer 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.650
 but I will also cause it if I do not know 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.760
 it makes them so long 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.590
 while it is finished extracting I wanted to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.360
 had to close the torrent then 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.290
 when you close the torrent there if 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.510
 You can eliminate all this 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.650
 before I did not let Boris small the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.650
 open wind torrent 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.800
 I finished 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.600
 is finished extracting all this too 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.460
 I delete this the iso file 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.040
 he deleted everything and only left the 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.860
 folder asks which we enter have the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.340
 setup in crack and good whatever comes in 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.970
 his game 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.129
 thieves how is that good here is already 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.040
 like any installation of any 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:19.090
 game they give to accept execute 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.090
 [Music] 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.580
 next next 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.960

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.850
 good and it will feel like any game 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.780
 When you finish installing you will win 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.690
 crack and copy and paste this into the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.790
 folder where games are installed and she 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.160
 has the full full game they do not have 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.060
 to use the monturque the truth is a 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 kings program 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.710
 s 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.870
 this is a program that spins and 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.370
 and it's much better to do it from this 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.900
 way you do not need anymore the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.870
 montull is a program less in your 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.850
 computer is faster you're not going to have 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.150
 another job another program working 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.110
