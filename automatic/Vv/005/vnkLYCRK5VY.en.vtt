00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
like this and then open up the end and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.920 
like this and then open up the end and
now<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> make<00:00:35.400> and<00:00:35.670> XL<00:00:36.980> do<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:41.129> then

now at the make and XL do this and then

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.220 
now at the make and XL do this and then
make<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.250> freeze<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.270> now<00:00:48.270> descending<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.199> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
make a freeze and now descending to the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.650 
make a freeze and now descending to the
other<00:00:49.440> side

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.780 

and<00:00:55.470> so<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.130> you<00:00:56.430> end<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.989> something<00:00:58.790> what

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
to keep this set and I it's bend over

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.870 
to keep this set and I it's bend over
like<00:01:04.760> this<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.239> make<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.320> crease<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.980> now<00:01:07.400> open

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
like this and make a crease and now open

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.420 
like this and make a crease and now open
it<00:01:08.000> back<00:01:08.180> up<00:01:08.240> flickr<00:01:09.230> sighs<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.070> now<00:01:10.130> audience

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
it back up flickr sighs and now audience

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.520 
it back up flickr sighs and now audience
is<00:01:10.700> sick<00:01:10.880> if<00:01:11.000> you're<00:01:11.240> in<00:01:11.300> fresh<00:01:11.510> middle<00:01:11.840> then

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
is sick if you're in fresh middle then

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.670 
is sick if you're in fresh middle then
these<00:01:13.130> two<00:01:13.190> sides<00:01:13.550> should<00:01:14.060> talk<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.720> then

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
these two sides should talk and then

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.810 
these two sides should talk and then
just<00:01:16.040> put<00:01:16.580> them<00:01:16.729> together<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.830> then<00:01:18.830> fold<00:01:19.670> it

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
just put them together and then fold it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.820 
just put them together and then fold it
in<00:01:19.970> more<00:01:20.210> like<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.650> then<00:01:22.660> press<00:01:23.830> that

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
in more like this and then press that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.640 
in more like this and then press that
and<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:25.940> now<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.690> have<00:01:26.720> these<00:01:26.990> suicides<00:01:27.410> run

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
and so now you have these suicides run

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.830 
and so now you have these suicides run
your<00:01:27.770> routes<00:01:27.950> are<00:01:28.100> open<00:01:28.460> like<00:01:28.790> that<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.780> you

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
your routes are open like that so you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.130 
your routes are open like that so you
take<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> side<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.180> then<00:01:32.180> now<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:32.930> have<00:01:33.020> to

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
take the side and then now you have to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.040 
take the side and then now you have to
line<00:01:33.770> out<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.190> middle<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.610> take<00:01:35.119> across

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
line out to the middle and take across

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.350 
line out to the middle and take across
it<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.130> i'll<00:01:37.250> do<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.520> same<00:01:37.550> thing<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
it and i'll do the same thing to the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.760 
it and i'll do the same thing to the
other<00:01:38.390> side<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.509> now<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.930> something<00:01:42.200> you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
other side so now you have something you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.040 
other side so now you have something you
have<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.890> diamond<00:01:43.369> up<00:01:43.460> here<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:44.180> now<00:01:44.540> erecting

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
have a diamond up here and now erecting

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.639 
have a diamond up here and now erecting
a<00:01:45.140> lot<00:01:45.350> there<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.890> then<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.399> try<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.700> one

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
a lot there and then to try this one

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.410 
a lot there and then to try this one
said<00:01:48.649> let's<00:01:48.830> hit<00:01:48.979> take<00:01:49.280> these<00:01:49.790> handle<00:01:50.210> still

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
said let's hit take these handle still

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.650 
said let's hit take these handle still
and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:51.410> cross<00:01:52.250> them<00:01:52.490> over<00:01:52.670> again<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:53.539> they

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
and then cross them over again so they

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.260 
and then cross them over again so they
line<00:01:53.869> up<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.289> line<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.850> make<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> crease

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
line up to the line and make a crease

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.200 
line up to the line and make a crease
and<00:01:56.720> now<00:01:57.470> do<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.979> same<00:01:58.190> thing<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.460> other<00:01:58.850> side

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
and now do the same thing to other side

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.870 
and now do the same thing to other side
and<00:01:59.840> make<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.110> narrow<00:02:00.320> crease<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.369> opposite

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and make a narrow crease on the opposite

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.960 
and make a narrow crease on the opposite
side<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.710> once<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.670> done<00:02:04.910> that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
side and now once you have done that

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.240 
side and now once you have done that
I'll<00:02:05.479> see<00:02:05.780> what's<00:02:05.960> happening<00:02:06.350> yeah<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.009> today

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
I'll see what's happening yeah so today

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.969 
I'll see what's happening yeah so today
I<00:02:07.280> looks<00:02:07.459> like<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:07.789> flip<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.600> over<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.080> then

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
I looks like this flip it over and then

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.520 
I looks like this flip it over and then
you<00:02:10.429> see<00:02:10.789> this<00:02:11.000> line<00:02:11.330> right<00:02:11.510> here<00:02:11.569> cross<00:02:12.500> it

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
you see this line right here cross it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.970 
you see this line right here cross it
over<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.520> make<00:02:14.020> sure<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.290> lined<00:02:15.560> up<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
over and make sure it's lined up and

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.040 
over and make sure it's lined up and
then<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.910> should<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.180> automatically<00:02:17.630> sir

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
then this should be automatically sir

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.030 
then this should be automatically sir
and<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.980> now<00:02:19.520> get<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.300> priestess<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.740> this

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and then now get the priestess to this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
and then now get the priestess to this
line<00:02:22.280> right<00:02:22.430> here<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:22.849> when<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.690> ends<00:02:23.959> its

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
line right here so when this ends its
