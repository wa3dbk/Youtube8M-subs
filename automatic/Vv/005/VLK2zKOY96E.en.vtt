00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
just on a single or maybe two reps
instead<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.450> three<00:01:57.690> but<00:01:58.170> you're<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.830> see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
instead of three but you're gonna see

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370 
instead of three but you're gonna see

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.850 
putting weight onto the bar I haven't
gone<00:02:11.009> past<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.580> 25<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.080> flat<00:02:13.260> bench<00:02:13.470> for

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
up so three that was a force rep and for

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.830 
up so three that was a force rep and for
this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> force<00:02:55.290> strip<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:55.680> here<00:02:55.739> also<00:02:56.010> so

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
this is a force strip right here also so

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
this is a force strip right here also so
after<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.930> go<00:02:58.170> force<00:02:58.500> reps<00:02:58.830> or<00:02:59.040> go<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> failure

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
after you go force reps or go to failure

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.970 
after you go force reps or go to failure
and<00:02:59.760> beyond<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.380> saw<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and beyond like you just saw there the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.550 
and beyond like you just saw there the
next<00:03:02.400> sets<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.880> gonna<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.299> harder<00:03:03.560> your

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
next sets are gonna be a lot harder your

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.320 
next sets are gonna be a lot harder your
strength<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.190> definitely<00:03:05.340> taxed<00:03:05.940> after<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
strength is definitely taxed after that

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.130 
strength is definitely taxed after that
so<00:03:07.130> here's<00:03:08.130> 225<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.390> don't<00:03:09.510> know<00:03:09.810> how<00:03:09.959> many

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
so here's 225 and I don't know how many

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.780 
so here's 225 and I don't know how many
reps<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:10.470> got<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.860> sure<00:03:11.010> by<00:03:11.220> myself<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.730> think

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
reps they got for sure by myself I think

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.270 
reps they got for sure by myself I think
like<00:03:12.060> four<00:03:12.330> or<00:03:12.510> five<00:03:12.709> but<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:13.950> pretty<00:03:14.070> good

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
like four or five but it's pretty good

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.500 
like four or five but it's pretty good
I'm<00:03:14.400> trying<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.700> really<00:03:14.880> control<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> weight

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
I'm trying to really control the weight

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.320 
I'm trying to really control the weight
as<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.810> solve<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.200> 275<00:03:17.030> control<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.150> down

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
as you solve the 275 control it down

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.820 
as you solve the 275 control it down
explode<00:03:18.900> up<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.260> even<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.470> pause<00:03:19.799> at

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
explode up you even a little pause at

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.130 
explode up you even a little pause at
the<00:03:20.130> bottom<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:21.030> real<00:03:21.180> heavy<00:03:21.360> sets<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:21.989> I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the bottom on the real heavy sets but I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.370 
the bottom on the real heavy sets but I
think<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.440> best<00:03:22.620> I've<00:03:22.830> ever<00:03:22.860> done<00:03:23.299> I've<00:03:24.299> done

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
think the best I've ever done I've done

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.259 
think the best I've ever done I've done
275<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.830> six<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.580> flat<00:03:26.790> bench<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
275 for like six on the flat bench and

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.050 
275 for like six on the flat bench and
I've<00:03:27.360> done<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.810> nine<00:03:28.230> or<00:03:28.620> ten<00:03:29.370> times<00:03:29.610> on

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
I've done it like nine or ten times on

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.000 
I've done it like nine or ten times on
the<00:03:30.239> decline<00:03:30.660> bench<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.680> was<00:03:31.830> when<00:03:31.950> I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the decline bench and that was when I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.259 
the decline bench and that was when I
was<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.160> lot<00:03:32.340> heavier<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:32.910> still<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.180> was

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
was a lot heavier but still I was

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.030 
was a lot heavier but still I was
probably<00:03:33.510> about<00:03:33.690> 20<00:03:34.019> pounds<00:03:34.260> heavier<00:03:34.530> than<00:03:34.590> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
probably about 20 pounds heavier than I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.850 
probably about 20 pounds heavier than I
am<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:36.000> uh<00:03:36.030> yeah<00:03:36.570> anyway<00:03:37.019> so<00:03:37.049> that<00:03:37.680> was

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
am now but uh yeah anyway so that was

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.590 
am now but uh yeah anyway so that was
the<00:03:38.010> last<00:03:38.220> set<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.910> was<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.060> last<00:03:39.239> rep<00:03:39.480> I

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the last set I that was the last rep I

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.110 
the last set I that was the last rep I
had<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.739> think<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:41.010> did<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.370> one<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.820> strep

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
had and I think I did like one for strep

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.569 
had and I think I did like one for strep
right<00:03:42.299> here<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.720> down<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.889> then<00:03:44.100> he<00:03:44.220> helps<00:03:44.459> you

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
right here so down and then he helps you

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.340 
right here so down and then he helps you
up<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:44.940> force<00:03:45.209> reps<00:03:45.450> are<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> great<00:03:45.870> way<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.079> kind

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
up so force reps are a great way to kind

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.970 
up so force reps are a great way to kind
of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
of

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.380 
of
oh<00:03:47.010> really<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.519> muscle<00:03:47.790> guys<00:03:47.909> didn't<00:03:48.180> want<00:03:48.300> to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
oh really the muscle guys didn't want to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.550 
oh really the muscle guys didn't want to
do<00:03:48.450> them<00:03:48.540> every<00:03:48.659> single<00:03:48.840> workout<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.379> I<00:03:49.409> like

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
do them every single workout but I like

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280 
do them every single workout but I like
to<00:03:49.650> do<00:03:49.769> them<00:03:49.860> occasionally<00:03:50.580> here<00:03:51.150> is<00:03:51.330> 185<00:03:52.049> for

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
to do them occasionally here is 185 for

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.479 
to do them occasionally here is 185 for
a<00:03:52.349> few<00:03:52.590> reps<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.099> after<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.180> 185<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.049> did<00:03:55.489> 135

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
a few reps and after this 185 I did 135

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.240 
a few reps and after this 185 I did 135
for<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.819> 15<00:03:57.180> or<00:03:57.299> 20<00:03:57.599> so<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.890> pyramid

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
for like 15 or 20 so the kind of pyramid

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.640 
for like 15 or 20 so the kind of pyramid
scheme<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.580> used<00:03:59.819> is<00:04:00.180> warm<00:04:00.659> up<00:04:00.840> warm<00:04:01.019> up<00:04:01.230> warm<00:04:01.409> up

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
scheme I used is warm up warm up warm up

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.190 
scheme I used is warm up warm up warm up
then<00:04:02.129> go<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.610> know<00:04:02.730> all-out<00:04:03.060> heavy<00:04:03.540> set<00:04:03.840> then

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
then go you know all-out heavy set then

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.479 
then go you know all-out heavy set then
dropped<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.620> weight<00:04:04.769> increased<00:04:05.190> reps

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
dropped the weight increased reps

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.520 
dropped the weight increased reps
dropped<00:04:05.849> away<00:04:06.000> increase<00:04:06.480> reps<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.110> drop<00:04:07.349> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
dropped away increase reps and drop the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.680 
dropped away increase reps and drop the
weight<00:04:07.650> increase<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.220> reps<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:09.150> think<00:04:09.629> I

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
weight increase the reps so I think I

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.089 
weight increase the reps so I think I
did<00:04:09.810> like<00:04:09.989> a<00:04:10.019> 4<00:04:11.120> 4<00:04:12.120> then<00:04:12.540> 6<00:04:12.959> then<00:04:13.170> like<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.799> don't

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
did like a 4 4 then 6 then like I don't

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.770 
did like a 4 4 then 6 then like I don't
know<00:04:14.250> how<00:04:14.340> many<00:04:14.489> this<00:04:14.579> was<00:04:14.790> maybe<00:04:15.030> 8<00:04:15.180> or<00:04:15.360> 10<00:04:15.540> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
know how many this was maybe 8 or 10 and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.590

and<00:04:56.010> November<00:04:56.340> 9th<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.820> thinking<00:04:57.060> about

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
and November 9th and thinking about

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.690 
and November 9th and thinking about
doing<00:04:57.360> two<00:04:57.599> shows<00:04:57.870> physique<00:04:58.320> shows<00:04:58.700> only

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
doing two shows physique shows only

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.050 
doing two shows physique shows only
issue<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.270> they<00:05:00.479> are<00:05:00.660> MPC<00:05:01.229> shows<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:02.010> for<00:05:02.970> those

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
issue is they are MPC shows so for those

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.730 
issue is they are MPC shows so for those
who<00:05:03.120> don't<00:05:03.270> know<00:05:03.570> well<00:05:03.960> one<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.349> shows<00:05:04.560> is

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
who don't know well one of the shows is
