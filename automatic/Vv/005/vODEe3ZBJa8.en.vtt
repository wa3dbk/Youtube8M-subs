you go to steer with it and the slower
that<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> goes<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.259> tougher<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that it goes the tougher it is to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.450 
that it goes the tougher it is to
actually<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.990> two<00:02:01.380> wheels

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
actually get back up on just two wheels

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
actually get back up on just two wheels
so<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> tends<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> flop<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so it tends to kind of flop back and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.719 
so it tends to kind of flop back and
forth<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:05.009> while<00:02:05.159> while<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> tries

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
forth for a little while while it tries

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.030 
forth for a little while while it tries
to<00:02:05.790> pick<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> little<00:02:06.450> bit

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
slowing down the bike itself also slows

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.250 
slowing down the bike itself also slows
