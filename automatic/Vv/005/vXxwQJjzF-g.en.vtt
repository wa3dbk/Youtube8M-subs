00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.250
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.710
 I finally have it again today 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.440
 a hairstyle video and I want to 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.900
 you guys in this video three lateral 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.360
 braided hairstyles show normal 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.610
 braid once with herringbone braid 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.239
 plaiting the first hairstyle is for 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.559
 for example, this hairstyle is the front of it 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.489
 is easy and here with back 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.260
 woven 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.730
 So if you like these hairstyles 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.129
 Do you really care ? 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.629
 not long then just be so 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.519
 then we start with the first season 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.370
 even that's what this hairstyle is 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.559
 I said in the video as I said 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.570
 Wear and nothing on my sister 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 will this hairstyle braid 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 and the principle is totally just so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.220
 you have a normal stringy 3 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.100
 Braid braid and from the front side 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 always do not take and only from the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 rear side countries recording by 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 you see that very well then I take 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 now here with the hair from behind 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.520
 top from the front then no one I take 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520
 a contract about 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.990
 Here you can see that it is easy 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 flaky lever 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.540
 there you can braid so far down 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.490
 I want to have here already on grad 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.360
 I also believe in weaving at the very bottom 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.580
 So there you are really totally flexible 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.750
 that's what they have to leave and that is 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.750
 then the first hairstyle 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 The second hairstyle is actually accurate 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.759
 reversed who of you the videos of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.530
 devon james cook on youtube who knows 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.010
 so maybe that's from the jazz 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.570
 made himself very often, and then I thought 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.130
 I say I do the same again 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.010
 it turns around and that's just how it is 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.380
 I braided very closely that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.900
 I now always from the beginning to hair 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.350
 have taken and from behind no and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.760
 if you pull it relatively tight 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.580
 the zombie wraps up a bit 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.380
 rum 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.520
 I think you can see it here in one 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.520
 Recording also quite good 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.969
 namely again from the front and back 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:45.969
 none 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.670
 there you see if you fold over there 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.770
 Of course you can vary 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.450
 the firmer it counts, the more it gets 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.700
 to fold this braid and I have it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.819
 now done relatively tight and see 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.530
 you finish it then 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.840
 this is the third hairstyle that there is one 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.670
 a braided herringbone braid 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.900
 I did on one side 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.569
 and then completely down 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.849
 unbundled I've ever been a 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.590
 video made into an interwoven 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.790
 herringbone I plait Link you the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.790
 definitely in the infobox 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.070
 and I also link one to you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.810
 How to use a general guide 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.090
 pigtail makes that too 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.890
 totally simple principle is just that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.040
 to weave with two streams and from 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.780
 the side always has something to it 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.490
 and if you want to do it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.010
 you keep from the side still extra 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.439
 take hair with pure 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.930
 I have this relatively tight 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:51.030
 Made because I just have that effect 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.680
 wanted that it does not look messi 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.680
 here you can not see it a close-up 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.100
 and then I just at the end of all 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.290
 normal herringbone to under 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.400
 then braided relatively tight it has yes 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.470
 also taken a bit 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.810
 So you already need the hairstyle 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.730
 a few minutes 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.180
 but of course he also looks great 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.180
 out 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.110
 yes and that is already my doubt 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 future 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.660
 so that 's it then again 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.070
 the video I hope you liked it 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.930
 if yes gives me a thumbs up 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.480
 and write me in the comments 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.900
 because the hairstyles please if you the 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.220
 sometimes , or if you wear them 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
 now want to try it and if so 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.240
 Of course, please write to me 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.860
