00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 all beaver dear friends with you windows and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.359
 we continue to discuss our teaser 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.980
 who appeared on the scott surrender site 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 The first theory that I would like with you 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 talk like this animatronic 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.330
 is animatronic from jav's forehead and no 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'm not talking about is not in springtrape 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 springtrap on is exactly sat in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.529
 jar 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.330
 remember once we said that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.340
 springtrap is animatronic which 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 collects all the parts that is which 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.740
 consists of other animatronics like 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.960
 that this animatronic theme is about 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.890
 This was said before the five nights 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.450
 at freddys 3 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.340
 why I think so well first let's 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
 look at freddie's heads which 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 him all over my body why do I think this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 it is Freddy who testifies to this. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.219
 hat and by the way pay attention to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.160
 the rightmost Freddie had double 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.039
 the jaw is nothing like 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.930
 freddy from fnaf 2 old freddy 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.480
 so it can symbolize 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 3 freddie todo freddie old freddie new 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.149
 Freddie he is like a hunter wears 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.090
 their trophy also pay attention to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.189
 head it is very similar to the head gone 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.350
 At the same time, this animatronic is not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 is bonnie because he has five 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.340
 fingers like springrapa if you suddenly 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 don't see five fingers read by 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.229
 pads as well as the texture on the shoulder 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 It is very similar to spring waste 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 Russian so we go out that 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.830
 Bonnies in fnaf 3 are missing because 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.369
 this dude use his fucking 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.200
 head 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.049
 if you suddenly say oh my god he 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.780
 not like the eyes on the background here in his eyes 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.840
 not so black he has pupils and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.479
 moreover, personally, I see veins there 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.380
 interesting maybe there sits a man in 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.150
 h pink guy and even after dying 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 springtrap took his hand 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.350
 Well, maybe the body is difficult even as 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 say but we also found out the reason 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.439
 Freddie's disappearance in fnaf 3 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.930
 it's all because he's killed about it 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.390
 symbolizes the heads of 3 Freddy on his 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 torso also what i still noticed me in 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 comments wrote that his hand itself 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.939
 arm looks like a foxy it is noticed even 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 he doesnâ€™t tell me very much 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.350
 hand cut 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.440
 it turns out that he took his hand 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.510
 from foxy fingers from springtrap then things 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.340
 from springtrap head from gods 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 that's all we're on it at the moment 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 we see but another interesting thing with him 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.970
 the teeth are very sharp not like normal ones 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.040
 animatronic interesting these teeth 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.630
 mean something to the heap of fact 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.060
 which basically says nothing to u 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.330
 his sharp fingers are the most important 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 fingers 5 so he either animatronic 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.630
 who was still in the days of gold 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 animatronic what I doubt 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.970
 either he uses parts of himself 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.370
 springtrap can this mean that he 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.270
 killed Freddie Bonnie and at least 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.150
 springtrap 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.450
 maybe it's animatronic who hunts 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.370
 on animatronics maybe it's pink 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.680
 the guy who is in costume 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.350
 which is possible especially given the veins in 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.360
 his eyes continue to kill these children 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.220
 after they escaped from him 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.530
 write in the comments how do you think 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.240
 this is all the facts that I would like 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.220
 tell on this video but I still 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.750
 I will continue to disassemble, I think more will come 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.750
 a couple of videos so teaser
