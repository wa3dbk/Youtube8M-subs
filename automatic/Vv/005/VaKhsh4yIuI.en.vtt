the<00:01:02.609> field<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:02.969> away<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> things

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the field right away one of the things

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.640 
the field right away one of the things
that<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.890> tell<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> players<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:07.500> weigh

that I tell the players is to weigh

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620 
that I tell the players is to weigh
themselves<00:01:07.860> before<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> after<00:01:09.000> practice<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
themselves before and after practice and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.780 
themselves before and after practice and
if<00:01:10.560> they're<00:01:10.740> losing<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.369> than<00:01:11.430> three

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
if they're losing more than three

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
if they're losing more than three
percent<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.360> their<00:01:12.900> body<00:01:13.049> weight<00:01:13.670> during<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
percent of their body weight during that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.080 
percent of their body weight during that
during<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> practice<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.909> need

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
during the practice then there they need

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.230 
during the practice then there they need
to<00:01:18.180> drink<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.400> son<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.850> example

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to drink more so my son for example

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.310 
to drink more so my son for example
who's<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.930> here

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
who's out here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.899 
who's out here
he<00:01:22.799> weighed<00:01:23.009> 197<00:01:23.880> before<00:01:24.210> practice<00:01:24.630> 192<00:01:25.259> after

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
he weighed 197 before practice 192 after

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
he weighed 197 before practice 192 after
5<00:01:26.909> pounds<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:28.020> 3<00:01:28.380> percent<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.979> he's<00:01:29.159> ok

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
5 pounds that's 3 percent and he's ok

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.340 
5 pounds that's 3 percent and he's ok
but<00:01:29.850> at<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> end<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.780> practice<00:01:30.900> he<00:01:31.259> was

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but at the end of practice he was

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
but at the end of practice he was
already<00:01:31.619> feeling<00:01:31.950> nauseous<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> little<00:01:32.820> bit

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
already feeling nauseous in a little bit

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.999 
already feeling nauseous in a little bit
so<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> edge<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.799> heat

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
so he was right on the edge the heat

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.330 
so he was right on the edge the heat
index<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.110> critical<00:01:37.110> right<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
index is really critical right now you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
index is really critical right now you
know<00:01:38.460> how<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> humidity<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.780> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
know how the humidity is up there so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889 
know how the humidity is up there so
even<00:01:40.590> though<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.770> 110<00:01:41.430> you've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> 25%

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
even though it's 110 you've got a 25%

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
even though it's 110 you've got a 25%
humidity<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.189> affecting<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.820> kids

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
humidity so it's affecting these kids

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.889 
humidity so it's affecting these kids
like<00:01:45.240> 120<00:01:46.189> 125<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:48.299> other<00:01:48.509> thing<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
like 120 125 the other thing that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
like 120 125 the other thing that
humidity<00:01:49.229> does<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.369> doesn't<00:01:50.850> allow<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
humidity does is is doesn't allow you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.719 
humidity does is is doesn't allow you
your<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> way<00:01:52.140> your<00:01:52.290> body<00:01:52.439> cools<00:01:52.860> off<00:01:53.100> as<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
your the way your body cools off as you

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
your the way your body cools off as you
sweat<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.720> evaporates<00:01:55.350> well<00:01:55.740> with

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sweat in the in evaporates well with

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.130 
sweat in the in evaporates well with
being<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.340> humid<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.600> don't<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
being so humid you don't have the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.910 
being so humid you don't have the
ability<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.250> evaporation<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.469> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
ability to have that evaporation so it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.180 
ability to have that evaporation so it
makes<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.399> harder<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> players
