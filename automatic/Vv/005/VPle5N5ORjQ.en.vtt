exist
you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.260> reasonably<00:00:46.949> harmoniously<00:00:47.580> but

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you know reasonably harmoniously but

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
you know reasonably harmoniously but
it's<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> point<00:00:48.269> now<00:00:48.510> where<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.650> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
it's at a point now where you know it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
it's at a point now where you know it's
resources<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.370> running<00:00:50.610> out<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:52.530> threat

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
resources are running out and the threat

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
resources are running out and the threat
of<00:00:52.980> slipping<00:00:53.370> back<00:00:53.519> into<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.970> was<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of slipping back into what was is is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.770 
of slipping back into what was is is
always<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.650> our<00:00:55.800> shoulder<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.660> know

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
always over our shoulder and so you know

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
always over our shoulder and so you know
we're<00:00:57.900> at<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.110> point<00:00:58.320> where<00:00:58.440> we're<00:00:58.620> reaching

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
we're at that point where we're reaching

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.549 
we're at that point where we're reaching
out<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.250> trying<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.750> build<00:01:01.049> again<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
out and trying to to build again you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.750 
out and trying to to build again you
know<00:01:01.650> to<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:04.140> bring<00:01:04.350> back<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.489> tools

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
know to to to bring back in the tools

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that are necessary to for us to go to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.039 
that are necessary to for us to go to
another<00:01:08.159> level<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.479> cultivate

and start to spread out and start to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.899 
and start to spread out and start to
exist<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.799> humans<00:01:14.190> need<00:01:14.700> and
