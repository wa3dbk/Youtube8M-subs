fourth set the alien abduction this is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.900 
fourth set the alien abduction this is
probably<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> best<00:02:25.470> alien<00:02:26.280> set<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:28.910> aliens

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
probably the best alien set like aliens

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.550 
probably the best alien set like aliens
versus<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.930> probably<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> best<00:02:31.350> one

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560

that seems more to the earrings um

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.199 
that seems more to the earrings um
because<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.630> basically<00:02:36.900> captures<00:02:37.739> the
