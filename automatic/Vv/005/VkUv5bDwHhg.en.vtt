00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.110
 Hi, beauties and welcome to this new 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.480
 today's video today I propose a 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.200
 look inspired by a mac lipstick from the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 line mate and is the lady danger the avian 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.630
 I'm wearing red lipstick today 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.390
 orange more orange than red and then 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.130
 I think it looks pretty good for a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
 summer night as it is quite 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 striking on the lips and in the eyes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.230
 also so I thought it would be ideal 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.150
 for the night I hope that there is the me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.379

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.039
 bye 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.160
 I'm going to start this look by applying a 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.140
 test is on all the movable eyelid 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.840
 and fixed and also on the lacrimal to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.340
 ensure the duration of all 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.070
 shadows that I will be using 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.670
 successively I will take a shadow 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.560
 This is a bronze comb mac 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.440
 the constructivist tone and I'm going to 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 Apply with a flat brush on everything 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.160
 the mobile eyelid 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.050
 I'm going to do it very well 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.050
 covering all spaces 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.610
 the next thing is to blur that shadow in 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.510
 cream applied on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.909
 and I'm going to do it because I need not 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.069
 there are white spaces, empty spaces 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.990
 on the part of the basin which later 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.990
 I'm going to apply another shade color 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.690
 I'm going to take now the naked palette 1 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.110
 the color back that is a cold brown and what 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.460
 I'm going to place over the basin 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.830
 blurring it very well with a brush 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.640
 to blur I'm using these 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.640
 of the psoe goes 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.450
 I'm going to take a bronze brown color with 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.580
 flashes is the darkest color that I go 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.520
 to be using today is called play 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.319
 want and it's from the naked palette 3 I'm going 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.030
 to apply with a mini step and with a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.120
 precision brush what you guys 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.489
 have on hand on the outside of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.130
 eyelid this is doing to 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.580
 intensify the look and intensify 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.400
 also the eye then then what I'm going 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.790
 to do is to blur all that shadow 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.069
 dark so it 's even and you see 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.069
 better with the rest of the makeup 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.659
 I will now take the lighter color of 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.609
 the palette linke 3 and I'm going to apply 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.650
 about my lacrimal to create a point of 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:17.599
 light and make my eyes look more 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.599
 open and as more awake 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.890
 now I will be applying a gold color 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.109
 bronze in the central part of the eyelid 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.670
 I'm doing it to create a point of 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.069
 light also in this area 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.860
 with a matt black color like that of the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.099
 naked palette basics I'll be doing 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.959
 as a line is not a delineated 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.690
 I just want to intensify a bit 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.690
 plus the area attached to the eyelashes 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.020
 I'm going to check my tabs with a 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:53.350
 curler and then I'm going to apply mask 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.320
 I 'm doing it with 30 pauses 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.710
 seconds between one pass and another for 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.570
 that the effect is more intense and with more 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.210
 voluminous for my eyelashes I'm going to take 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.190
 the color player of the naked palette 3 that 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.060
 we used previously and I'm going to create 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:14.280
 an outline that we say very subtle in the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.280
 lower part of my eyes 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.850
 now I will move to the eyebrows after 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.010
 I have combed them, I'm going to design them 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.840
 I'm going to fill it in, you know 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.150
 that I have a video here on the channel in 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.920

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.260
 I make my eyebrows so I invite you to 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.730

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.730
 in the information box 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.120
 obviously do not apply the concealer 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.430
 although I had already applied the base when 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.680
 I started recording because I'm using 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.070
 dark shadows and is not the most appropriate 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.600
 apply the concealer before starting 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.300
 work the shadows because you can 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.740
 mess up the work done then what 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.630
 what I'm going to do now is apply my 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.230
 corrector and blur it with the brush of 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:11.100

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.390
 illuminator of noirs in a color like 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:23.370
 golden bronzed very flirtatious and like 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.410
 special for the summer and it's going very well 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.150
 with this makeup I'm going to apply it in 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.720
 the upper part of my cheekbones and in the 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.720
 septum of the nose 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.490

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:44.220
 cheekbones with this browser 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.930

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.680
 Now I'm going to delineate to outline my 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.210
 lips with a pencil in a pretty color 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.910
