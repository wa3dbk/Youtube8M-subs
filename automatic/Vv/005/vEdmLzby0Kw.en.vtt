00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.930
 Hello everyone with you Dominata Spies want 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.299
 see baroque 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.599
 what is he right in front of you his name 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.650
 corner 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.309
 Do not forget to like if 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 liked 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.360
 And so enjoy watching what's all 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.700
 hi friends with you again I knock the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.590
 space today we will look 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.240
 loss set for ga bionicle is with us 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.130
 40 heads 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.200
 as you can see the set is enough 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.910
 interesting and remarkable in its essence 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.880
 he is mobile 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:43.220
 legs-hands paw there is such a function 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.980
 rather inconspicuous it may seem 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.660
 you are funny and comical enough but 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.329
 in fact it is not so because it 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.200
 hut and barracks were many in history 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.770
 old bionicle 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.739
 they drained the seas destroyed erased with 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.450
 faces of the land of the mountain and in general they brought 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.500
 huge danger to existence 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.469
 mata nui 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.960
 Well, they stopped then of course 6 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.240
 I killed Ort and the barracks which 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.570
 They stepped on them with his super strength and 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.280
 after that they even managed to kill 6 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.500
 the city of calls which were much more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.270
 smarter than their predecessors well 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.060
 Prefer barracks is such 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.330
 here is the function quite well 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.409
 implemented very very interesting and here 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 his faucet keeps a crane in his head 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.220
 from whom lettuce color how you can 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.750
 see and what is a crane crane this mask 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 which controls baroque 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.820
 it is actually their mind they also happen 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.430
 different shapes and in different colors 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.860
 outwardly differ of course slightly 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.500
 but in any case have a huge 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.450
 reflection and for me to me in the universe itself 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.060
 also here you can see small 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.670
 you are engraving on popsicle touching written 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.650
 I don’t know something there, but I’ll look in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.049
 guidebook as i have it by 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.360
 bionics quite a while I bought it when I was 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.430
 small and bionicle here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.350
 he came out such were already pies 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.980
 because when this guy came out 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.890
 I was two ladies 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.740
 Well, the functions do not end there 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.690
 Of course, the cleaning was integral 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.780
 its function which was then 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.690
 implemented in bakugan 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 if anyone knows the kids themselves 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.080
 In fact, it was such a cartoon and then 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.030
 began to produce game sets of course 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.720
 same and everything in my class is just on them 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.170
 the fans 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 I'm a fanatel for the summer but in general, for the sake of 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.520
 Interest of course I bought myself a set 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.760
 bakugan but I have to say this 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.220
 nonsense but do not advise anyone want it 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.710
 it is no longer unpopular so here it can 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.600
 become so hot and roll 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.790
 certainly not very good due to the fact that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.960
 just a little more accurate here is this head she 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.160
 little of the overall design stands out 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.080
 but in any case, a good idea if 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.350
 Che would have realized it was better than it was 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 general mortality zashibenno but basically here 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.630
 cabin fights nothing more on it 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.640
 can not say the special character of the barracks 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.100
 not at least the first 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.850
 coll versions certainly had more 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.610
 greater intelligence and talk but know how 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.820
 here these are the giant whether the role of such an overnight stay 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.740
 under no se como of similar mechanoids 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.080
 devastating destroyers erased them all 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.390
 on my way this was all with you I 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.110
 domino the space and heads all good luck 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.110
 bye everyone
