00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.590
 the model of a barrier in scale 1 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 to 45 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 the barriers become trees 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.480
 Electromotive moves I press one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.460
 push button and hold it tight the motor 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.080
 continues to run until the barriers tree 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.080
 here below or above 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.300
 the desired position has been reached 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.300
 the button is released 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 an automatic shutdown is not 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.440
 built-in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.170
 you just press so long until the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.369
 barriers down or up are here 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.369
 Example in real time 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.850
 here again the entire process 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.310
 The camera lasts a bit longer 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.359
 on it so that all this in peace 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.359
 can look at 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.049
 So far everything is fine and good, but now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:57.200
 only the known barriers are missing 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.200
 my idea ring a mp3 doorbell 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.939
 you get something like that in the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.160
 Internet store for a little under 30 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:10.349
 euro with the included usb cable 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.470
 this bell connected to the pc 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.810
 when connecting to the pc opens 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.120
 an over game window that way 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.049
 easily a mp3 sound on the bell 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.840
 transfer 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.010
 two cables from the trio with push button to this 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.110
 Pole finished the sound is a bit ahead 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 but if many model loks alongside 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.140
 its sound is reasonably good 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.140
 OK 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.390
 The bell can now under the module 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.390
 be mounted
