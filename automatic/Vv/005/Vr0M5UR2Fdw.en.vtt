00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.619
 plants like all organisms 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.840
 living need the help of 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.480
 different nutritional elements for 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:31.000
 grow and develop as well as one 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.000
 correct dispensing and lighting 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.860
 every chemical element has been brought 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.360
 according to the right quantities 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.730
 some of them are necessary to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.420
 plant to a more considerable extent e 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.300
 they are therefore called macroelements 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.830
 for example, nitrogen, phosphorus and 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.720
 potassium 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.250
 others instead serve more 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.250
 reduced like iron and are called 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 microelements 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.120
 a fundamental preliminary operation 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.430
 to be accomplished is the recognition of 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.320
 symptoms of deficiencies that can 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.640
 be confused with those of some 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.830
 illnesses 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.650
 it is therefore necessary to learn to distinguish i 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.200
 typical symptoms of deficiencies so as to 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.150
 to then be able to intervene correctly for 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.490
 rebalance the optimal situation 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.490
 to the life and development of the plant 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.939
 certainly the mechanism is not so 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.700
 automatic since the plants are 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.590
 however complex and living organisms 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
 the lack of an element could 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 be determined by a multiplicity 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.810
 of causes among which there may be 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.979
 also diseases or deficiencies or 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.979
 excesses of other elements 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.300
 in any case the golden rule to be kept 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.640
 present is the knowledge of 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.190
 characteristics and needs of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 plants we deal with in 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.150
 so as to intervene too 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.150
 correctly in advance
