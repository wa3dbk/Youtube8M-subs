and this is how their diagrammed there's

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.880 
and this is how their diagrammed there's
two<00:01:24.880> types<00:01:25.150> of<00:01:25.330> transistors<00:01:25.960> one<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.860> a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
two types of transistors one is a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.580 
two types of transistors one is a
negative<00:01:27.520> positive<00:01:27.820> negative<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.440> other

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
one is a positive negative positive you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.930 
one is a positive negative positive you
can<00:01:32.350> tell<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.650> difference<00:01:33.010> in<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.220> diagram<00:01:33.760> by

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
can tell the difference in a diagram by

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.360 
can tell the difference in a diagram by
looking<00:01:34.330> at<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.600> arrow<00:01:34.810> pointing<00:01:35.409> away<00:01:35.560> or

pointing to the base for this video

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.550 
pointing to the base for this video
we're<00:01:40.480> really<00:01:40.659> not<00:01:40.930> going<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.140> look<00:01:41.290> at<00:01:41.440> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
we're really not going to look at the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.200 
we're really not going to look at the
difference<00:01:41.980> they're<00:01:42.190> both<00:01:42.430> switches<00:01:42.850> so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
difference they're both switches so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.580 
difference they're both switches so
we're<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.510> to<00:01:43.570> look<00:01:43.690> at<00:01:43.840> their<00:01:44.020> role<00:01:44.230> as<00:01:44.530> a

transistors<00:02:21.900> are<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> lot<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.470> faucets<00:02:23.120> water

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
transistors are a lot like faucets water

transistors are a lot like faucets water
comes<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.780> source<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.920> faucet<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.520> it

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
comes from the source in a faucet and it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.240 
comes from the source in a faucet and it
waits<00:02:27.150> at<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.390> valve<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.920> flow<00:02:29.190> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
waits at the valve the flow is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.160 
waits at the valve the flow is
controlled<00:02:29.730> by<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.270> valve<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.020> might

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
controlled by that valve so you might

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.810 
controlled by that valve so you might
say<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> valve<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.010> switch

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
say the valve is the switch

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.240 
say the valve is the switch
there's<00:02:33.450> moving<00:02:33.930> parts<00:02:34.350> because<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
there's moving parts because you have to

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490 
there's moving parts because you have to
open<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.700> valve<00:02:36.120> when<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.630> valve<00:02:36.900> opens

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
open that valve when the valve opens

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.160 
open that valve when the valve opens
water<00:02:38.490> then<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.210> flow<00:02:41.900> transistors<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
water then can flow transistors are a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.470 
water then can flow transistors are a
lot<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.590> faucets<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.370> instead<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.790> water

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
lot like faucets but instead of water

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.570 
lot like faucets but instead of water
we<00:02:45.960> have<00:02:46.170> voltage<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.950> comes<00:02:47.220> from<00:02:47.400> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
we have voltage that comes from the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.180 
we have voltage that comes from the
source<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.780> voltage<00:02:49.170> waits<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.830> gate

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
source and the voltage waits at the gate

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.120 
source and the voltage waits at the gate
like<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.730> water<00:02:50.940> waited<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.660> valve<00:02:52.130> now

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
like the water waited at the valve now

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
like the water waited at the valve now
the<00:02:53.190> flow<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.790> voltage<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.450> controlled

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the flow of this voltage is controlled

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.470 
the flow of this voltage is controlled
by<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.170> gate<00:02:55.500> but<00:02:56.310> instead<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:56.790> having<00:02:56.970> moving

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
by the gate but instead of having moving

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.070 
by the gate but instead of having moving
parts<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.500> have<00:02:58.530> moving<00:02:59.010> electrons<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.180> then

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
parts we have moving electrons and then

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.770 
parts we have moving electrons and then
when<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> valve<00:03:01.680> opens<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.030> gate<00:03:03.270> opens

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
when the valve opens or the gate opens

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.550 
when the valve opens or the gate opens
in<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.110> transistor<00:03:05.000> current<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.600> flow<00:03:09.560> once

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
in a transistor current can flow once

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.220 
in a transistor current can flow once
current<00:03:10.980> flows<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.610> load<00:03:12.300> now<00:03:12.570> has<00:03:12.870> what<00:03:13.110> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
current flows the load now has what it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.610 
current flows the load now has what it
needs<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.590> operate<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> thinking<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
needs to operate so thinking of a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.220 
needs to operate so thinking of a
transistor<00:03:17.250> think<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.180> water<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.960> valve

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
transistor think of a water and a valve

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
transistor think of a water and a valve
and<00:03:19.590> you'll<00:03:20.040> have<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> pretty<00:03:20.520> good<00:03:20.700> impression

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
and you'll have a pretty good impression

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140 
and you'll have a pretty good impression
of<00:03:21.240> how<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> works<00:03:22.340> now<00:03:23.340> here's<00:03:23.580> some<00:03:23.790> simple

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
of how it works now here's some simple

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.030 
of how it works now here's some simple
logic<00:03:24.540> as<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.840> think<00:03:25.050> about<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:25.500> whatever

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
logic as we think about this whatever

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.100 
logic as we think about this whatever
comes<00:03:26.370> from<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.730> source<00:03:27.000> waits<00:03:27.390> at<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.630> gate

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
comes from the source waits at the gate

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.260 
comes from the source waits at the gate
so<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.650> battery<00:03:29.010> voltage<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.820> waits

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
so if we have battery voltage it waits

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.060 
so if we have battery voltage it waits
at<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.570> gate<00:03:30.870> can't<00:03:31.350> make<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.650> any<00:03:31.800> farther

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
at the gate can't make it any farther

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.790 
at the gate can't make it any farther
than<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.640> if<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.480> gate<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.720> open<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> source

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
than that if the gate is open the source

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920 
than that if the gate is open the source
can<00:03:35.310> then<00:03:35.550> get<00:03:35.760> through<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.450> make<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.720> all

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
can then get through it and make it all

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.500 
can then get through it and make it all
the<00:03:37.080> way<00:03:37.200> down<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> load<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.100> if<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.300> load

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
the way down to the load and if the load

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.810 
the way down to the load and if the load
is<00:03:39.690> good<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.620> source<00:03:41.010> will<00:03:41.280> then<00:03:41.460> make<00:03:41.640> it

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
is good the source will then make it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.230 
is good the source will then make it
work

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
work

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.550 
work
and<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.980> motor<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.430> run<00:03:44.780> now<00:03:45.780> if<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.200> gate<00:03:46.380> is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
there is nothing at the source there's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.260 
there is nothing at the source there's
not<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.060> be<00:03:54.120> anything<00:03:54.750> at<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.080> gate<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
not going to be anything at the gate and

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.240 
not going to be anything at the gate and
then<00:03:57.270> of<00:03:57.420> course<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.990> load<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.350> bad<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
then of course if the load is bad the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
then of course if the load is bad the
source<00:03:59.580> can't<00:03:59.880> make<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.270> anyway<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.020> motor

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
source can't make it anyway so the motor

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
source can't make it anyway so the motor
won't<00:04:01.560> run<00:04:01.860> so<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.210> have<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.390> good

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
won't run so we do have to have a good

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
have your collector your base or near

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.590 
have your collector your base or near
your<00:04:12.360> meter<00:04:13.760> now<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:14.970> there's<00:04:15.180> nothing

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
your meter now if there's nothing

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.890 
your meter now if there's nothing
flowing<00:04:16.020> into<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.560> base<00:04:17.420> nothing<00:04:18.420> can<00:04:18.630> flow

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
flowing into the base nothing can flow

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.110 
flowing into the base nothing can flow
from<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.320> collector<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.920> Mitter<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:21.000> if

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
from the collector to the Mitter but if

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.090 
from the collector to the Mitter but if
you<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.450> something<00:04:21.840> flowing<00:04:22.109> into<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.890> base

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
you have something flowing into the base

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.490 
you have something flowing into the base
then<00:04:23.790> whatever<00:04:24.090> comes<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.840> collector<00:04:25.260> can

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
then whatever comes to the collector can

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.480 
then whatever comes to the collector can
go<00:04:25.680> out<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> emitter<00:04:27.890> again<00:04:28.890> if<00:04:29.100> something

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
go out to the emitter again if something

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.210 
go out to the emitter again if something
is<00:04:29.640> flowing<00:04:29.910> into<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.419> base<00:04:30.690> then<00:04:31.650> something

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
is flowing into the base then something

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.999 
is flowing into the base then something
can<00:04:32.430> flow

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
can flow

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.570 
can flow
a<00:04:33.039> collector<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.849> emitter<00:04:35.580> here's

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
a collector to the emitter here's

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.459 
a collector to the emitter here's
another<00:04:36.909> little<00:04:37.180> diagram<00:04:37.719> picture<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.259> kind

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
another little diagram picture that kind

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.760 
another little diagram picture that kind
of<00:04:38.529> shows<00:04:38.710> how<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.159> works<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.729> would<00:04:40.270> have

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
of shows how this works you would have

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.379 
of shows how this works you would have
battery<00:04:41.770> power<00:04:41.800> coming<00:04:42.369> in<00:04:42.639> waiting<00:04:43.059> into<00:04:43.270> the

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
battery power coming in waiting into the

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.899 
battery power coming in waiting into the
gate<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:43.839> once<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.349> gate<00:04:44.559> is<00:04:44.589> open<00:04:45.219> then<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
gate and once the gate is open then the

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.200 
gate and once the gate is open then the
current<00:04:46.270> can<00:04:46.419> flow<00:04:47.879> so<00:04:48.879> that's<00:04:49.059> how

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
current can flow so that's how

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.399 
current can flow so that's how
transistors<00:04:49.960> work<00:04:51.809> so<00:04:52.809> now<00:04:52.960> we<00:04:53.020> know<00:04:53.259> how

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
transistors work so now we know how

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:54.989 
transistors work so now we know how
transistors<00:04:54.099> work<00:04:54.339> they're<00:04:54.639> actually

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
transistors work they're actually

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.600 
transistors work they're actually
switches<00:04:55.479> with<00:04:55.659> no<00:04:55.869> moving<00:04:56.110> parts<00:04:56.399> so<00:04:57.399> let's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
switches with no moving parts so let's

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.420 
switches with no moving parts so let's
see<00:04:57.819> now<00:04:58.089> how<00:04:58.449> transistor<00:04:59.289> switches<00:05:00.189> on<00:05:00.309> a

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
see now how transistor switches on a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.759 
see now how transistor switches on a
coil
