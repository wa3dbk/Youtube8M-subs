00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.819 
know we'll just kind of do the same
thing<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.200> will<00:01:55.350> hardly<00:01:55.649> see

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
thing you know then we will hardly see

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.429

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
like i said i'm sure that bunch one

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.209 
like i said i'm sure that bunch one
won't<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:00.960> generic<00:02:01.320> collectible<00:02:01.920> seeing

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
won't be too generic collectible seeing

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
won't be too generic collectible seeing
maybe<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.390> they'll<00:02:03.840> require<00:02:04.110> different

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
maybe you know they'll require different

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.249 
maybe you know they'll require different
attributes<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.549> different<00:02:06.509> tabs<00:02:06.689> different

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
attributes or different tabs different

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
attributes or different tabs different
things<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.619> I'm<00:02:07.770> sure<00:02:07.879> but<00:02:08.879> yeah<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
things like that I'm sure but yeah this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.520 
things like that I'm sure but yeah this
is<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.509> interesting<00:02:09.750> idea<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.440> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
is kind of an interesting idea like I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.020 
is kind of an interesting idea like I
said<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:10.830> cutting<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.970> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
said it's cutting to they don't go to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.770 
said it's cutting to they don't go to
the<00:02:12.209> graveyard<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.720> stay<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> field<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
the graveyard they stay on the field so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.449 
the graveyard they stay on the field so
yeah<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.110> wonder<00:02:14.440> how<00:02:14.530> that's<00:02:14.740> going<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.130> end<00:02:15.190> up

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
