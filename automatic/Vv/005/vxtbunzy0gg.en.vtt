00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.729
 in this city we actually need 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.470
 of elected officials who is engaged 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.879
 whether they are on the ground they 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.320
 go see people who are not 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.180
 in their ivory tower in their office 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.390
 that's what we want to make a team 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.930
 free available serious skills and 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.720
 honest 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.740
 I am 43 years old for 43 years we are 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.269
 passed to a city douz city 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.769
 inhabitants we just have to absorb the 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.550
 starting from 15 9 for me I find that 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.349
 this is unacceptable 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.460
 we need to have a city project that 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.810
 take the barracks and the draft 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.310
 daycare today but also 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.199
 widen it to the strong and do it 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.039
 something in there if we engage the 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.480
 construction of the snow front 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.190
 if we fight with all our might on 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.500
 the hospital and if we start the project of 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.750
 the restructuring of the arn and efforts 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.050
 and barracks in exchange briançon for 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.050
 20 years 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.590
 all this is the ford is she who is the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.879
 bigger no project zero 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.989
 investment it is absolutely necessary 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.970
 we sell as soon as we value 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.050
 the exception the nature near the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.829
 parc des Ecrins especially that you 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.030
 will not find anywhere else 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.320
 of course when we need it because 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.370
 that we started falling asleep there 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.870
 a little new blood is the eyes 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.449
 outside is really the case in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.019
 deferred he's going ahead he's his mode 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.190
 listening 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.860
 it really is the right way 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.119
 a lot of availability a lot of 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.100
 sympathy a lot of sincerity 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.750
 it's been eight months now that I 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.580
 know and experience 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.990
 professional outside of bouaye 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.550
 children will be an asset for briançon 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.869
 yes yes actually young people in sight 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.399
 from a more ambitious they quickly 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.020
 can do things and then we 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.640
 is interested in them yes we have to see the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.200
 things from a new look to be able to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.610
 to rejuvenate this policy a little bit 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.119
 from the city of briançon there are many 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.920
 working 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.050
 rails this city and let's go back with 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.940
 a new team and my vision is 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.080
 that we can only do it 100% because 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.000
 that there is far too much work for 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.710
 to be able to do this halfway since the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.509
 elected are not present all that is missing 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.060

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.759

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.680
 strength 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.390
 a modern mayor he's on the ground 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.960
