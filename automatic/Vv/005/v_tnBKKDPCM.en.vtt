00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 If it is flying (Hataba), saying that it will not return 

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:13.400
 What I aimed for is a great ugly that sky 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.700
 "Sadness" can not be learned yet "Sorrowfulness" has begun to grasp now 

00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:38.200
 This emotion for you is now changing to "words" 

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:44.600
 Awakening from the Yume of the Unknown World 

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:50.200
 Spread this wing and fly away 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 If it is flying (Hataba), saying that it will not return 

00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:03.800
 I aimed at a white white cloud 

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:10.100
 I know that I could find it if I pierced it 

00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:16.100
 It's about to shake it up 

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:24.000
 Ugly Ugly Ugly Ugly Ugly Ugly 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.700
 A rusty old window is broken with a sound that is endearing 

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:42.000
 I will throw away the basket I've seen, I will never look back 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:48.600
 Resonate your breathing on a high beat 

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:54.300
 Kick off this window and fly away 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.200
 If you run out, say that you can get it 

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:07.700
 It's far away that far away that voice 

00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:14.000
 I'm too dazzled, hold your hand 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:20.500
 As you ask, it's ugly 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 I knew it would go down 

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:46.600
 Still I will follow the light 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.500
 If it is flying (Hataba), saying that it will not return 

00:02:53.501 --> 00:03:00.000
 I searched for a white white cloud 

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:06.000
 I know that I could find it if I pierced it 

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:12.850
 It's about to shake it up 

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:20.500
