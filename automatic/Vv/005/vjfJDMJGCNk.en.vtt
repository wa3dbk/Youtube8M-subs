00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
transferred to the screen so what we'll

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.470 
transferred to the screen so what we'll
need<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> do<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.290> use<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.530> strip<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.430> metal<00:00:46.730> to

transfer that into the screen instead of
your<00:00:49.550> finger<00:00:50.380> now<00:00:51.380> as<00:00:51.740> you<00:00:51.800> can<00:00:52.130> see<00:00:52.310> this

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
your finger now as you can see this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.580 
your finger now as you can see this
works<00:00:52.760> fine<00:00:53.000> even<00:00:53.390> with<00:00:53.510> tape<00:00:53.780> on<00:00:53.990> top<00:00:54.020> it

still moves the screen properly and what

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.230 
still moves the screen properly and what
we'll<00:00:59.060> do<00:00:59.270> is<00:00:59.560> we'll<00:01:00.560> start<00:01:00.920> out<00:01:01.070> by<00:01:01.850> cutting

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
we'll do is we'll start out by cutting

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.390 
we'll do is we'll start out by cutting
the<00:01:02.329> strip<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.750> foil<00:01:03.050> into<00:01:03.530> shape<00:01:03.980> something

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
the strip of foil into shape something

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.749 
the strip of foil into shape something
like<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:05.420> doesn't<00:01:05.780> need<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.900> be<00:01:06.020> perfect

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
like this it doesn't need to be perfect

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.080 
like this it doesn't need to be perfect
then<00:01:07.759> you'll<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.540> lay<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:10.399> pencil<00:01:10.850> on

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
then you'll just lay the I the pencil on

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.690 
then you'll just lay the I the pencil on
top<00:01:11.499> and<00:01:13.270> bend<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.420> around<00:01:14.539> like<00:01:15.170> this<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:16.520> let

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
top and bend it around like this so let

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.349 
top and bend it around like this so let
the<00:01:16.819> end<00:01:16.969> is<00:01:17.149> covered<00:01:18.880> don't<00:01:19.880> really<00:01:20.149> worry

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
won't really do much now grip it touch

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.260 
won't really do much now grip it touch
the<00:01:29.060> screen<00:01:29.450> make<00:01:29.840> sure<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.139> blunt<00:01:30.439> end<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:31.429> on
