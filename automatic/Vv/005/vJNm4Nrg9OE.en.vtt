little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.579> wide<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.480> put<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
little bit wide so you could put the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
little bit wide so you could put the
tire<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> manual<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.520> over

and<00:01:27.509> super<00:01:28.080> frustrated<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and super frustrated because the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.649 
and super frustrated because the
bunnyhop<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.850> onto<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.299> pretty<00:01:30.479> high

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bunnyhop to get onto it was pretty high

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.910 
bunnyhop to get onto it was pretty high
see<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.710> had<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
see even that I kind of had to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
see even that I kind of had to
concentrate<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.729> hard<00:01:32.759> as<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> could<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.509> get

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
concentrate as hard as I could to get

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
concentrate as hard as I could to get
high<00:01:34.140> enough<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.829> onto<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> rail<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
high enough to get onto the rail and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
high enough to get onto the rail and
then<00:01:36.150> hope<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:37.020> lined<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
then hope that I was lined up with it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
then hope that I was lined up with it
eventually<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.610> just<00:01:38.640> worked<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.390> even

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
eventually it just worked and they even

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
eventually it just worked and they even
kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.840> popped<00:01:40.200> off<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.439> kink<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> landed

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
kind of popped off the kink and landed

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.760 
kind of popped off the kink and landed
on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> second<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.030> perfect<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
on the second down perfect and there the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
on the second down perfect and there the
way<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> waited<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.210> while<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> then

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
way and waited a little while and then

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.459 
way and waited a little while and then
threw<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.439> bike<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:46.979> my<00:01:47.009> hands<00:01:47.340> up

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
threw my bike in my hands up

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.349
