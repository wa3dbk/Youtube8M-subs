00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
about that for now because we'll just

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.590 
about that for now because we'll just
bobby<00:00:44.760> pin<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.090> later<00:00:46.820> now<00:00:47.820> taking<00:00:48.180> both<00:00:48.360> two

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
bobby pin out later now taking both two

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
bobby pin out later now taking both two
sections<00:00:49.170> i'm<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.070> interlock<00:00:50.640> them

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sections i'm going to interlock them

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.760 
sections i'm going to interlock them
together<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.899> means<00:00:52.079> instead<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> some

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
together so this means instead of some

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.380 
together so this means instead of some
eight<00:00:52.920> words<00:00:53.100> i'm<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.910> twisting<00:00:54.239> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
eight words i'm going to be twisting in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.770 
eight words i'm going to be twisting in
words<00:00:54.629> instead<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.460> key<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.180> twist

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
words instead so the key is to twist

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
words instead so the key is to twist
nice<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> tight<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> as<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.510> can

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
nice and tight and as much as you can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
nice and tight and as much as you can
really<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> stop<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> by

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
really and I'm going to stop a by

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.690 
really and I'm going to stop a by
two-thirds<00:01:02.910> way<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> I'm<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
two-thirds way down so then I'm going to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
two-thirds way down so then I'm going to
split<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.720> sections<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.260> hair<00:01:07.290> into

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
split these two sections of hair into

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.399 
split these two sections of hair into
three<00:01:08.159> sections<00:01:08.880> night<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> i'm<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.140> going

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
three sections night and i'm just going

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.280 
three sections night and i'm just going
to<00:01:10.470> break<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.240> should<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to break down I so this should make the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
to break down I so this should make the
hair<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:13.979> unique<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.090> twist<00:01:15.570> rope

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
hair some more unique it is a twist rope

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
but as it reaches Steinberg's it's going

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.429 
but as it reaches Steinberg's it's going
to<00:01:18.509> eventually<00:01:18.840> turn<00:01:19.350> into<00:01:19.380> afraid<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> now

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
