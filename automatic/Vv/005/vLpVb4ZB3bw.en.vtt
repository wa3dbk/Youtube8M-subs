 opponent and strong magically hire 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.909
 cons is weakness of the beginning and 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.909

 enemy team and hold and pretty 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.050
 still high for poland 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.090

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.920
 seconds 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.130
 second steel onopenko thinks mana 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.910
 adversary in proportion to his 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.880
 intelligence and inflict damage equal 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.060
 amount of scorched mate 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210
 these claims are inferior to edgar 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.020
 rise in price following on which 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.070
 communication boundary passes and also becomes 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 your abuser the size of 4 seconds 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.540
 very good incentive to get rid of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.260
 chase 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.430
 and here we are getting close to him 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.390
 by the way on the subconscious tendency 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.580
 when activated, the drive side by side with 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.990
 rhubarb and increased speed 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 movement by 20 percent if not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 touch on such a goal shifts to institute a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.960
 get 500 all there agana last 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 stewart level 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 so far this wealth is questionable 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.140
 several levels higher than ours 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.680
 unexpected fall probably started 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.330
 affects experience 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 significantly pull and often 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.840
 even drink Prague hero especially well 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.960
 they can do it now with 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.030
 the sixth in one canteen really still 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.020
 Not in time for kindergarten and not even 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.739
 have time to understand that the rule was to go 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.969
 have u are one so we have to 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.090
 purchase items from them perfectly 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.230
 Now let's talk 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.489
 byt based on law 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.730
 so how to kill the extradition progressed 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.049
 it was buy in shells up 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.139
 no work 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.379
 due to the fact that 6 is higher 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.440
 we just need a novel 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.270
 an example of which is worth buying 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.359
 is a city of us dollars 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.749
 thanks to her practically 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.309
 regardless spartak don't go there just for 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.519
 shopping 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.379
 third item if you are missing 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.379
 bathroom is worth buy saudi 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.169
 but this is nothing it all started it 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.389
 majesty chopsticks card like that 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.959
 Want to know that this is not worth it if 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.359
 enemies this is your question 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.439
 for the remaining money you can purchase 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.479
 Blue stock so our rental will be 40 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.089
 percent more powerful 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:00.269
 either the limited sphere is the enemy 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.129
 the team has a lot of producers 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.269
 or if you want to be better then you 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.129
 better to collect a damn fan 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.859
 so the transit remained in the queue 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.319
 in this corner of our petakki place charisma 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.199
 also worth buying plato 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.329
 abbot our primary means 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.310
 replenishment a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.160
 in these apartments also does not hurt 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.199
 badly 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.259
 after all these guys you need to collect 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.929
 completely go do your dirty 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:24.899
 affairs 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.939
 You can buy a topic 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.259
 the texts have bought a butterfly 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.419
 hello everyone my name is kirill and here 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.979
 Rimma subject who spoke at the beginning 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.249
 called coastal 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.739
 Well, I introduced myself and the meeting because of 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.899
 gallon don't know why he didn't 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:41.639
 Chief 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.029
 now you can get down to business 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.009
 but also as an initiator my idea 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.689
 do it plays sosa Sina was exactly me 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.119
 that is, the other train was not strong, too, was mine 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:54.399
 well, except for the demonstration of skills 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.329
 where is he 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.879
 but personally you wanted 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.349
 show some passages 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.799
 Waide Japan 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.629
 designed to show what you are or is required 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.499
 not only knowledge characters 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.379
 but what you need to be friends with logic 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.730
 in the first segment 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.890
 I am very tired of carrying when he 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.489
 was in the camp and when he woke up he abandoned 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.489
 me right under my tower but I didn't leave 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.280
 but in the second segment I did not drank too much 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.419
 how well did magnus work at 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.729
 aid union distilled threw off almost all of our 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.389
 team under the fountain 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.979
 new nobody naturally survived 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.979
 one hundred percent 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.270
 Well, in conclusion, Gaddafi should 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.809
 specify in what way you need to develop 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.919
 so and all of Europe is unique 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.679
 Caucasians need to adapt to 

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:20.159
 current situation and think for yourself in 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.370
 what order and what to collect 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.120
 now she is coming home 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.150
 melancholic factions and 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.830
 will tell about our plans in the subsequent 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.460
 saw the conclusion can say no 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.190
 writing is quite complex and interesting 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.189
 the first 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.299
 which assemblies may be different 

00:05:36.299 --> 00:05:38.349
 game assistants to players 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.069
 there is another sports complex 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.159
 bed bases 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 good luck everyone all bye 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.119
 Well, in conclusion I would like to say 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.639
 old next is just a manager 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.919
 very funny sorts out local 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.429
 the process of collecting the persecuted is going to you 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:11.779
 must decide for themselves
