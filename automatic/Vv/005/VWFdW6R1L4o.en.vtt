00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.450
 federico pereyra romanos had to tell we are in another world in the world 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.099
 they continue such 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.689
 we are disturbed by other things 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:14.889
 i good that other than the directory of both 2000 the directory of some 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.890
 way of the arms not when yes when in summer these ladies have the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.580
 arm that 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.400
 pick up when Andrei and Nobel knows what is yours so we say what 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.039
 we do to make a work that plastia 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.439
 it can be in cases 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.659
 minimum or that its maximum minimum is only a slight sag of 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.270
 the skin this area 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.100
 It has easy repair without simply removing the inner skin 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.490
 of the arms where you do not notice signings that we are going to leave 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.040
 but these people who have lost a lot of weight are unequivocal 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.710
 we talk about cattle of morbid obesity people who have lost more 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.690
 of 100 kilos those people of this school this turn in the arms 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.040
 especially and in the thighs 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.320
 being much more uncomfortable the inner side of the thighs because it prevents them 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.220
 the ambulation is very uncomfortable in summer 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.650
 especially 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.140
 palm anyway 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.530
 tang burn more frequent the practice plasty some of the deadlines or the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.310
 Singapore 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.080
 the most frequent the arms 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.170
 one thing that looks more 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.550
 in small 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.930
 cases as we said in three degrees is perhaps closer 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.340
 but in people who have lost a lot of weight it is much more 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.510
 important the thighs why it is useless much more his life 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.020
 there we have some questions that are related to an issue that he 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.719
 it's also in the bowling legs 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.970
 it is a question of what has come to us from the street 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.040
 aa questions about reservoirs 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.910
 and the use of 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.490
 carved a laser treatment to cure the varices I would like to know if 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.850
 the flight and if it has any contraindication 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.460
 Well, we have received nothing before a specialist in surgery 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.170
 vascular and angiology 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.260
 everything was left 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.500
 javier leal mora cubero 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 tree what the series does 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.420
 is an increase in heat a heat production if we through the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.460
 saphenous vein 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.049
 or from another axis 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.639
 pln we introduce a form 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.739
 by puncture 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.219
 we can solve 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:19.489
 the problem of the veins that we treat in a minimally aggressive way and with 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.169
 a postoperative 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.229
 practically 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.129
 minimum 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.739
 can do normal life 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.830
 varapalo thanked the other side purse that always to be able 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.830
 lawyers to the questions and concerns of the spectators 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.020
 doctor 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.550
 federico pereyra romana in 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.879
 the silent movies for me 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.470
 you are the list and flaccidity that occur in the walls 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.289
 in his intervention of areces other than local 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:47.450
 not really 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.480
 we do what we can to summarize the anesthesia the periods of 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 hospitalization 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.849
 with epidural, we can pass the walls and arms only with 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.369
 local and sedation that enough 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:02.509
 and tell me how long the intervention lasts more or less common 2 hours 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.759
 operative times 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.039
 we always put a 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:10.469
 So many compressive bandages and the moses thigh arm is a bit uncomfortable plus the 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.269
 world the first days 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.609
 because you have to prevent a little ambulation 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.479
 and on the other hand if we recommend wandering my life it's always a problem 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.959
 thromboembolism 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.279
 i in a week is to take off the bandage that prevent you from making your life 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:24.719
 understand 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.700
 good for low 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.419
 you are in line with the one who is talking a lot to women but 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.769
 men come more and more frequently to the consultation of the 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.439
 specialists who took aesthetic and restorative plastic 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.559
 it will not be the europe europe plaza 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.559
 the drooping of the eyelids something that also worries men a lot 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.620
 yes maybe it is 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.699
 the operation that men ask us most 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.249
 are not 40 years on track the eyelids the fan that work 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.879
 they say if they are tired 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.389
 they start to request from us believe 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.389
 let's rejuvenate the priority area 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.489
 and what does this use you when you do that yes this intervention 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.569
 sure no 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.909
 does not mean risk are those that you think of the df from within itself 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.389
 same as personal reflection 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.909
 before the surgical act 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.889
 as always make a good diagnosis 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.449
 I do not know if it will be a problem these visual gijÃ³n modes make a 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.979
 previous study and if all is well 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.339
 rigorous with the technique because the subsidiaries lock k of minimal things like 

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:28.599
 it's an eyelid with a maximum body just like we talked before the two 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:29.749
 uncle minutes of the 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:31.039
 many's directory 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.749
 in the millimeter eyelids and the quantities of pitesti temos 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:36.509
 you were very welcome 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.969
 know very well the atony i fix the muscles of the area well 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.479
 produce 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.520
 in mauritius honor dysfunctions we mobilized for 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.279
 because we talked to pp the faba plasty 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.520
 tevez after conjunctival 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.840
 because we do the conjunctiva again 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.020
 there are people who worry about scarring on the eyelid 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.120
 and we those cases that do not on skin we can not do the elimination of 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.819
 grease 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.860
 through the whole 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.069
 I wanted no scar 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.520
 I do not understand perfectly 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.169
 but anyway, even the best is that how long it would take them to be able to 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.759
 go out and see the whole world 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.360
 really these operations 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.419
 are so concise this we treat with local anesthesia and basso constriction not 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.259
 bleed 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.499
 then of a week this insigne other 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:25.909
 that always present from May inside 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.349
 bruising in a week usually these 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.120
