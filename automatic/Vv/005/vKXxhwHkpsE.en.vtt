00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello children well found in mine 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.460
 kitchen view of christmas approaching 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.820
 today I have decided to offer you a recipe 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.110
 in the Christmas theme the classic biscuits al 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.730
 butter 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.880
 let's see together the ingredients we have 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.980
 500 g of 00 flour sifted from the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.820
 your mom 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:38.180
 go 110 grams of butter at a temperature 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:38.180
 environment 100 g of sugar 3 whole eggs 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.760
 a sachet of vanilla yeast for 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.390
 sweet and finally a pinch of salt 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.870
 a tip for mothers salt helps 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.230
 the leavening of biscuits in one 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.270
 large bowl we put everyone together 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.589
 the ingredients listed above 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:11.010
 first the sifted flour 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:13.830
 put the whole bag of yeast 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:22.259
 how much I recommend 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:25.280
 let's mix a little and put the 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.280
 compound in here 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.310
 then we put the three whole eggs 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:41.150
 previously beaten and we mix one 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.040
 little sugar with a spoon 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.420
 first mix with the spoon in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.860
 this way 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 then hands thoroughly after washing 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.890
 you can also knead with your fingers 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.280
 pull all the mixture well down 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.410
 between the spoon 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.270
 in this way take the butter that 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.760
 you have pulled out of the trust for a while already 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.320
 and put it in pieces like that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.320
 don't worry with your hands 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.920
 ok bixio and knead so with the tip 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.920
 of the fingers 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.560
 if the dough should be a little 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.570
 too dry 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 you can add a teaspoon of milk 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.030
 and go ahead to knead in this 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 so once he just took a while 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.410
 of consistency transferred from 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.080
 bowl on work changes a little bit more 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.150
 comfortable than the weapon but it will have washed you in 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.920
 right now add a pinch of 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.330
 rooms so just went ahead 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.300
 kneaded until you get a ball 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.020
 soft and smooth you will rest one 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.150
 half an hour as you see we have taken the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.290
 tablecloth because now children come the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 funniest moment 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.070
 we have to pull the dough once 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.320
 he rested a nice clean table 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:28.090
 let's put a little flour under it 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:30.100
 a little we review the dough in half and it 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.720
 I flatten a little before alarming 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:39.130
 then on the other in this way maybe 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.310
 we live with the help of a mother 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.700
 form a little more regular this 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.400
 way 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:54.800
 ok we are still a little flour and now 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:59.319
 with the wooden rolling pin always dirty 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.319
 a bit of pathos so we pull the dough 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.300
 meaning we are 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.400
 and then in this sense 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.050
 let's go on until you get one 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.110
 thickness of about 2 3 mm 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.959
 once this thickness is obtained 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:24.860
 Cut out the edges to get one 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.020
 regular shape and then with molds 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.990
 either in this case I took some 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.290
 little stars made from biscuits 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:41.320
 while you do this to turn on the 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:45.290
 oven to your mother 180 degrees 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:49.100
 as you can see I enjoyed doing 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.440
 many different shapes from the stars to the 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.020
 Santa Claus at the saplings gives you a 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.940
 advice before eating these 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.760
 biscuits too that you cooked them 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.860
 obviously you can hang them on the tree 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.170
 how with the back of one 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.360
 toothpicks make small holes 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:17.419
 this way before going into 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:21.740
 baking you christmas sapling in this 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:26.110
 so then once cooked with help 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:33.770
 of the mother you can tie them with the string 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.640
 thread and just the sapling ok oven e 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.980
 hot 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.350
 now we are cooking for about 10 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.960
 minutes or until you forgive yourself 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.140
 here is the final result these are i 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 our biscuits as you can see with 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.790
 the little hole pass through it the thread that 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.560
 sticking to the tree 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.080
 if you want to decorate them I give you an advice 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.410
 plus once denied out of the oven 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.790
 and let it cool for good then there 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.370
 take I made some chocolate and 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.199
 white chocolate in this case 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:13.040
 fork make some strips in 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:15.560
 this way so and you don't even do with 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.150
 of dark chocolate 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.150
 in this way always in strips 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:32.810
 ok 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.840
 and this is the end result and children 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.140
 you can have fun with those you have 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.470
 toothpick forks to color i 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.830
 your christmas cookies 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.830
 to the next
