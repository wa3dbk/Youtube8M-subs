00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the end of this video so we can get it a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.540 
the end of this video so we can get it a
little<00:03:17.489> bit<00:03:17.730> faster<00:03:17.910> than<00:03:18.270> 50<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.489> don't

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550
