and we'll show you what you get of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
and we'll show you what you get of
course<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.930> been<00:00:37.200> custom<00:00:37.739> made<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
course this has been custom made for the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.840 
course this has been custom made for the
z1<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.899> there's<00:00:40.050> two<00:00:40.260> parts<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.129> packet<00:00:41.610> or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
z1 so there's two parts to the packet or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
z1 so there's two parts to the packet or
to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> actual<00:00:42.690> tough<00:00:42.870> case<00:00:43.110> itself<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.190> get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
to the actual tough case itself you get

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
to the actual tough case itself you get
this<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.879> flexible<00:00:45.570> silicone<00:00:46.530> inner<00:00:47.340> shell

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this of flexible silicone inner shell

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.540 
this of flexible silicone inner shell
which<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:48.510> sits<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> tough<00:00:49.739> outer<00:00:50.160> shell

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
which then sits in the tough outer shell

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.090 
which then sits in the tough outer shell
so<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.140> already<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.739> has<00:00:52.920> got

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
so you can see already that this has got

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
so you can see already that this has got
some<00:00:53.309> cutouts<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> main<00:00:54.329> ports<00:00:54.809> controls

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
some cutouts for the main ports controls

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.729 
some cutouts for the main ports controls
and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.789> sit<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.260> z1

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and then what we do is we sit the z1

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
and then what we do is we sit the z1
inside<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.969> sort<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> framework<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
inside this sort of framework if you

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.770 
inside this sort of framework if you
like<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> case<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> with<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.570> there

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
like for the case so with that in there

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
like for the case so with that in there
you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.949> lights<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.339> power

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
you can see that the lights of the power

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.010 
you can see that the lights of the power
and<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> volume<00:01:06.180> keys<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.630> been<00:01:06.750> replaced

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and the volume keys has been replaced

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.800 
and the volume keys has been replaced
with<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.590> raised<00:01:08.430> rubber<00:01:08.820> pieces<00:01:09.119> save<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we've got the case-mate logo again down

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060 
we've got the case-mate logo again down
the<00:01:59.790> bottom<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:00.899> see<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.439> cutouts

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the bottom and you can see the cutouts

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.490 
the bottom and you can see the cutouts
continue<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> lanyard<00:02:03.390> cutout<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
continue for the lanyard cutout for the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.950 
continue for the lanyard cutout for the
speaker<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.060> pop<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.540> into

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
speaker and then you just pop this into

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.779 
speaker and then you just pop this into
the<00:02:07.950> outer<00:02:08.099> shell<00:02:08.599> like<00:02:09.599> so

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the outer shell like so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.850 
the outer shell like so
now<00:02:11.299> one<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.659> big<00:02:11.870> differences<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.530> is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
now one of the big differences here is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.729 
now one of the big differences here is
we<00:02:12.980> got<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.129> nice<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.640> lip<00:02:14.000> around<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:15.049> whole

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
we got a nice that lip around the whole

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.100 
we got a nice that lip around the whole
device<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:16.939> it<00:02:17.060> gives<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.480> extra<00:02:17.870> bit<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
device so it gives it that extra bit of

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990 
device so it gives it that extra bit of
protection<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.860> when<00:02:18.980> it's<00:02:19.099> face<00:02:19.430> down<00:02:19.790> just

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
protection so when it's face down just

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.569 
protection so when it's face down just
raised<00:02:20.599> up<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.049> fraction<00:02:21.650> let's<00:02:22.370> take<00:02:22.549> a

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
raised up that fraction let's take a

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.949 
raised up that fraction let's take a
look<00:02:22.819> at<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:22.970> back<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.390> we've<00:02:23.510> got<00:02:23.659> a<00:02:23.689> cutout

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
look at the back so we've got a cutout

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.449 
look at the back so we've got a cutout
here<00:02:24.379> for<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.159> camera<00:02:26.090> here<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:26.769> then<00:02:27.769> on<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
here for the camera here and then on the

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.100 
here for the camera here and then on the
top<00:02:28.670> we've<00:02:28.909> got<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.030> cutout<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.690> headphone
