using bootstrap and some of the things
we're<00:00:11.580> gonna<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.760> using<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.540> obviously

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
we're gonna be using is obviously

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.590 
we're gonna be using is obviously
bootstrap<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.220> we'll<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.700> downloading<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
bootstrap and we'll be downloading that

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.609 
bootstrap and we'll be downloading that
from<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.740> bootstrap<00:00:17.279> comm<00:00:18.050> we'll<00:00:19.050> also<00:00:19.320> be

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
from get bootstrap comm we'll also be

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.130 
from get bootstrap comm we'll also be
using<00:00:19.669> jQuery<00:00:20.669> which<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.329> a<00:00:21.359> JavaScript

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
using jQuery which is a JavaScript

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.819 
using jQuery which is a JavaScript
library<00:00:22.679> that<00:00:22.769> bootstrap<00:00:23.310> uses<00:00:23.909> and<00:00:24.829> we

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
library that bootstrap uses and we

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.290 
library that bootstrap uses and we
probably<00:00:26.159> won't<00:00:26.339> download<00:00:26.579> this<00:00:26.939> at<00:00:27.089> first

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
probably won't download this at first

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.149 
probably won't download this at first
but<00:00:27.599> we'll<00:00:27.749> come<00:00:27.929> back<00:00:28.109> later<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.679> get<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:29.159 
but we'll come back later and get it and

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.479 
but we'll come back later and get it and
that's<00:00:29.939> called<00:00:30.300> font<00:00:30.569> awesome<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:32.250> gives

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that's called font awesome and it gives

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.660 
that's called font awesome and it gives
us<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> library<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:34.140> lot<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.950> icons<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> we

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
us a library of a lot of icons that we

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.930 
us a library of a lot of icons that we
can<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.120> our<00:00:36.180> website<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.940> what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
can use in our website and what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.840 
can use in our website and what
bootstrap<00:00:39.510> does<00:00:39.810> is<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.620> allows<00:00:40.860> us<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.460> build

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
bootstrap does is it allows us to build

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.110 
bootstrap does is it allows us to build
a<00:00:41.940> website<00:00:42.150> that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> responsive<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.090> what<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
mean by that is whether you're viewing

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.360 
mean by that is whether you're viewing
in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.760> website<00:00:48.540> on<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> desktop<00:00:49.320> computer<00:00:49.500> or

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
in the website on a desktop computer or

in the website on a desktop computer or
an<00:00:50.640> iPad<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.450> mobile<00:00:51.690> phone<00:00:52.310> it's<00:00:53.310> always

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
an iPad or a mobile phone it's always

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
an iPad or a mobile phone it's always
going<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:53.820> adjust<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.600> fit<00:00:55.080> that<00:00:55.320> device<00:00:55.770> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
going to adjust to fit that device and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.680 
going to adjust to fit that device and
it's<00:00:56.670> actually<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.210> look<00:00:57.270> nice

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's actually going to look nice

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
it's actually going to look nice
whenever<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> does<00:00:58.770> adjust<00:00:59.130> to<00:00:59.310> fit<00:00:59.490> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
whenever it does adjust to fit that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.170 
whenever it does adjust to fit that
device<00:01:00.060> so<00:01:00.620> I'm<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> desktop<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.940> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
device so I'm on the desktop but as you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
device so I'm on the desktop but as you
can<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.600> whenever<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.710> start<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> make<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
can see whenever I start to make this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
can see whenever I start to make this
web<00:01:06.630> browser<00:01:06.870> smaller<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.800> see

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
web browser smaller you can see

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.820 
web browser smaller you can see
everything<00:01:08.520> starts<00:01:08.880> adjusting<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.870> right

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
everything starts adjusting and right

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420 
everything starts adjusting and right
about<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.870> hides<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:13.140> navigation<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.159> on

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
about here it hides the navigation so on

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.360 
about here it hides the navigation so on
an<00:01:14.550> iPad<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.010> it<00:01:17.100> would<00:01:17.190> look<00:01:17.310> like

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
an iPad this is what it would look like

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.219 
an iPad this is what it would look like
right<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.880> was<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.270> drop-down<00:01:18.570> menu

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
right here was a little drop-down menu

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.080 
right here was a little drop-down menu
and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.810> mobile<00:01:22.229> phone<00:01:22.700> even<00:01:23.700> smaller

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and then on a mobile phone even smaller

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.170 
and then on a mobile phone even smaller
and<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> scroll<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:28.170> are<00:01:28.500> gonna<00:01:28.650> be

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
and you can scroll and we are gonna be

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.780 
and you can scroll and we are gonna be
designing<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.950> web<00:01:31.950> page<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.159> looks<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
designing a web page that looks kind of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
designing a web page that looks kind of
like<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.120> one<00:01:33.299> right<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.830> we'll<00:01:34.830> probably

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
like this one right here we'll probably

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.120 
like this one right here we'll probably
add<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.970> stuff<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.260> maybe<00:01:37.830> make<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
add more stuff into it and maybe make it

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
add more stuff into it and maybe make it
a<00:01:38.250> little<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.490> fancier<00:01:39.120> and<00:01:39.650> throughout

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a little more fancier and throughout

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
a little more fancier and throughout
this<00:01:40.860> series<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.580> gonna<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.940> using<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.540> text

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
this series I'm gonna be using a text

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.630 
this series I'm gonna be using a text
editor<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.650> mac<00:01:43.979> called<00:01:44.490> text<00:01:45.270> Wrangler<00:01:45.630> and
