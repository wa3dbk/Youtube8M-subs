standard<00:00:23.340> graphics<00:00:23.760> processor<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.480> which

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
standard graphics processor here which

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.250 
standard graphics processor here which
is<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> integrated<00:00:25.650> Intel<00:00:26.010> graphics<00:00:26.580> HD<00:00:27.330> 3000

is the integrated Intel graphics HD 3000

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.490 
is the integrated Intel graphics HD 3000
which<00:00:28.650> shares<00:00:29.720> 384<00:00:30.720> Meg's<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> main

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which shares 384 Meg's with the main

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
which shares 384 Meg's with the main
memory<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:32.520> let's<00:00:32.669> go<00:00:32.759> ahead<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
memory so let's go ahead and do one of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330 
memory so let's go ahead and do one of
my<00:00:33.360> favorite<00:00:33.809> things<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:34.290> SSD<00:00:34.800> computer

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
my favorite things with an SSD computer

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
my favorite things with an SSD computer
and<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.520> launched<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.180> bunch<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> apps<00:00:36.630> just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and that's launched a bunch of apps just

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.920 
and that's launched a bunch of apps just
to<00:00:36.989> show<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.380> power<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.550> SSD<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to show you the power of the SSD so of

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.119 
to show you the power of the SSD so of
course<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.379> far<00:00:43.649> more<00:00:43.829> than<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
course this is far more than a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.560 
course this is far more than a
reasonable<00:00:44.280> person<00:00:44.760> would<00:00:44.879> toss<00:00:45.180> at<00:00:45.420> their

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
reasonable person would toss at their

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.450 
reasonable person would toss at their
MacBook<00:00:45.809> gear<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> idea<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
MacBook gear but you get the idea it's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
MacBook gear but you get the idea it's
very<00:00:47.640> stable<00:00:47.850> under<00:00:48.239> these<00:00:48.420> loads<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
very stable under these loads and it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
very stable under these loads and it's
certainly<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.559> quick<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.370> want<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
certainly very quick if you just want to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.279 
certainly very quick if you just want to
load<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> few<00:00:51.090> apps<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.629> shut<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.989> down<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
load a few apps or shut it down and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
load a few apps or shut it down and
restart<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> quickly<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> exactly<00:00:54.420> how<00:00:54.510> fast

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
restart it quickly so exactly how fast

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
restart it quickly so exactly how fast
is<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.500> SSD<00:00:55.920> well<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.430> run<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> disk<00:00:57.030> speed

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is this SSD well if we run a disk speed

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
is this SSD well if we run a disk speed
test<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.590> speed

the MacBook Pro hovers around 200 Meg's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.730 
the MacBook Pro hovers around 200 Meg's
per<00:01:30.210> second<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> read<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.049> write<00:01:31.350> speed

per second on the read and write speed

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.210 
per second on the read and write speed
and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.430> ima<00:01:32.820> hovers<00:01:33.240> around<00:01:33.439> 180<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and the ima hovers around 180 on the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670 
and the ima hovers around 180 on the
right<00:01:35.400> speed<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.670> around<00:01:36.240> 215<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> read

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
right speed and around 215 on the read

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
right speed and around 215 on the read
speed<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> MacBook<00:01:39.270> Air<00:01:39.450> has<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
speed so again the MacBook Air has a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080

ten<00:03:19.660> frames<00:03:19.930> per<00:03:20.079> second<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.620> two<00:03:20.919> point<00:03:21.220> five

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
ten frames per second and two point five

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.000 
ten frames per second and two point five
eight<00:03:21.639> points<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> CPU<00:03:22.629> score<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.829> can

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
eight points on the CPU score so you can

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.680 
eight points on the CPU score so you can
see<00:03:24.190> here<00:03:24.400> that<00:03:24.519> both<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.819> these<00:03:25.180> computers

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
see here that both of these computers

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.599 
see here that both of these computers
have<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:26.260> same<00:03:26.590> integrated<00:03:27.340> graphics

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
have the same integrated graphics

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.330 
have the same integrated graphics
processor<00:03:28.359> which<00:03:28.540> shares<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:29.079> RAM<00:03:29.349> with<00:03:30.069> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
processor which shares of RAM with the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.220 
processor which shares of RAM with the
main<00:03:30.819> memory<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.419> both<00:03:31.599> of<00:03:31.750> them<00:03:31.870> are<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
main memory so both of them are the

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.550 
main memory so both of them are the
Intel<00:03:32.739> HD<00:03:33.030> 3000<00:03:34.030> processor<00:03:34.540> now<00:03:35.199> if<00:03:35.290> we<00:03:35.409> look

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
Intel HD 3000 processor now if we look

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.770 
Intel HD 3000 processor now if we look
at<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.889> computer<00:03:36.190> with<00:03:36.519> dedicated<00:03:37.060> graphics<00:03:37.389> or

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
at a computer with dedicated graphics or

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.259 
at a computer with dedicated graphics or
a<00:03:37.810> discreet<00:03:38.500> graphics<00:03:38.530> processor<00:03:39.430> like<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
a discreet graphics processor like the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.539 
a discreet graphics processor like the
iMac<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.199> can<00:03:41.319> see<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.650> scores<00:03:41.919> are<00:03:42.129> very

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
iMac you can see that scores are very

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.909 
iMac you can see that scores are very
different<00:03:42.879> so<00:03:43.870> looking<00:03:44.109> at<00:03:44.229> the<00:03:44.319> iMac<00:03:44.620> we<00:03:44.769> get

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
different so looking at the iMac we get

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.860 
different so looking at the iMac we get
a<00:03:44.949> whopping<00:03:45.370> forty<00:03:45.669> three<00:03:45.879> point<00:03:46.090> five<00:03:46.419> frames

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
a whopping forty three point five frames

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.349 
a whopping forty three point five frames
per<00:03:47.109> second<00:03:47.590> with<00:03:47.919> a<00:03:47.949> CPU<00:03:48.430> at<00:03:48.669> six<00:03:48.940> point<00:03:49.120> eight

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
per second with a CPU at six point eight

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.849 
per second with a CPU at six point eight
four<00:03:49.690> points<00:03:50.109> that's<00:03:50.319> certainly<00:03:50.769> a

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
four points that's certainly a

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.800 
four points that's certainly a
significant<00:03:51.519> performance<00:03:52.209> difference<00:03:52.599> and

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
significant performance difference and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.750 
significant performance difference and
that's<00:03:53.260> thanks<00:03:53.500> largely<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.129> large

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
that's thanks largely to the large

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.059 
that's thanks largely to the large
graphics<00:03:55.329> processor<00:03:55.840> inside<00:03:56.409> the<00:03:56.530> iMac<00:03:56.859> which

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
graphics processor inside the iMac which

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.089 
graphics processor inside the iMac which
gives<00:03:57.310> us<00:03:57.430> two<00:03:57.699> gigs<00:03:57.970> of<00:03:58.150> dedicated<00:03:58.750> ram<00:03:59.099> so

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
gives us two gigs of dedicated ram so

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.649 
gives us two gigs of dedicated ram so
how<00:04:00.250> this<00:04:00.370> is<00:04:00.430> translate<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.150> real-world

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
how this is translate to real-world

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.089 
how this is translate to real-world
performance<00:04:01.930> well<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.560> kind<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.829> surprising

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
performance well it's kind of surprising

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.830 
performance well it's kind of surprising
the<00:04:03.519> MacBook<00:04:03.849> Air<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.150> paper<00:04:04.419> doesn't<00:04:04.659> look

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the MacBook Air on paper doesn't look

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.719 
the MacBook Air on paper doesn't look
like<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.169> can<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:05.440> anything<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:06.400> we<00:04:06.519> play

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
like it can do anything but if we play

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.140 
like it can do anything but if we play
Call<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.030> Duty<00:04:07.389> 4<00:04:07.599> it<00:04:07.900> runs<00:04:08.169> fairly<00:04:08.739> smoothly

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
Call of Duty 4 it runs fairly smoothly

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.490 
Call of Duty 4 it runs fairly smoothly
this<00:04:10.150> is<00:04:10.269> my<00:04:10.419> only<00:04:10.599> example<00:04:11.139> here<00:04:11.319> but

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
this is my only example here but

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.020 
this is my only example here but
certainly<00:04:11.949> higher-end<00:04:12.459> games<00:04:12.699> or<00:04:12.879> more

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
certainly higher-end games or more

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.399 
certainly higher-end games or more
modern<00:04:13.389> games<00:04:13.569> are<00:04:13.720> going<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.900> give<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.229> more

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
modern games are going to give you more

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.319 
modern games are going to give you more
trouble<00:04:14.590> we<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:15.430> occasionally<00:04:15.729> see<00:04:16.030> some

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
trouble we do occasionally see some

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.390 
trouble we do occasionally see some
frame<00:04:16.690> dropping<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.530> some<00:04:17.769> skips<00:04:18.039> here<00:04:18.280> and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
frame dropping and some skips here and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.039 
frame dropping and some skips here and
there<00:04:18.549> and<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.820> does<00:04:18.970> choke<00:04:19.299> on

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
there and it does choke on

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.980 
there and it does choke on
see<00:04:20.319> but<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.430> does<00:04:21.609> play<00:04:21.879> just<00:04:22.240> fine<00:04:22.509> and<00:04:22.840> this

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
see but it does play just fine and this

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.450 
see but it does play just fine and this
was<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.259> case<00:04:23.440> with<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.710> previous<00:04:23.800> Mexico

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
was the case with the previous Mexico

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.399 
was the case with the previous Mexico
which<00:04:24.639> was<00:04:24.909> even<00:04:25.210> lower<00:04:25.539> on<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.960> score<00:04:26.229> level

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
which was even lower on the score level

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.249 
which was even lower on the score level
so<00:04:26.949> I<00:04:27.220> would<00:04:27.490> say<00:04:27.699> if<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.360> want<00:04:28.569> this<00:04:28.870> computer

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
so I would say if you want this computer

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.529 
so I would say if you want this computer
for<00:04:29.409> gaming<00:04:29.440> it's<00:04:29.830> not<00:04:30.069> your<00:04:30.250> best<00:04:30.550> choice<00:04:30.729> but

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
for gaming it's not your best choice but

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.879 
for gaming it's not your best choice but
you<00:04:31.629> certainly<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:32.110> get<00:04:32.259> away<00:04:32.349> with<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.740> it's

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
you certainly can get away with it it's

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.879 
you certainly can get away with it it's
certainly<00:04:33.099> a<00:04:33.159> nice<00:04:33.430> side<00:04:33.759> benefit<00:04:34.889> already

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
certainly a nice side benefit already

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.499 
certainly a nice side benefit already
guys<00:04:36.009> that's<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.729> for<00:04:36.759> this<00:04:37.030> test<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.449> the
