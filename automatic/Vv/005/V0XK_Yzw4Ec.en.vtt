 Hey, my name, until I just do not 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.240
 accurate is teaching acceleration in the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:15.809
 sony affiliate is starting 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:17.340
 another video decided to launch a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 very interesting application that promises 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.300
 Accelerate the end of the dream I tested and 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.960
 accelerated greatly reduced the screens 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.670
 resuming and practically it does not exist 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 even in applications weigh up 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.719
 recommend you use when you want 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:43.530
 playing a heavy game decreased law then 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:46.070
 in the store leaves and below the historical and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 climate 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:19.229
 I just use it so it will not get anything 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:22.020
 hum stores processes and scam 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.720
 he will clean and ready 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:34.130
 now you just close and enjoy the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:41.700
 best of your sound opens the application 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:48.509
 heavy heavy but only to show 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.630
 cally remove the screen and no beauty 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.299
 returns to application 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.420
 you saw the intention without taking the canvas 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:01.189
 very good even and exports speaking there 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.439
 It's because I just left and entered 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.090
 new but even if you lock the screen and 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.649
 back to apps 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.259
 half an hour later it will be the same 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.930
 way before a screen resuming 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.099
 terrible because you are blocked and it is 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.200
 I especially hope you have enjoyed it. 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.840
 and silvia are around here who is not 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.840
