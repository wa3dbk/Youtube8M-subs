00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.550
 of small 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello how about friends and are welcome 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.910
 this time, we come to 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.220
 share them this new game called 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.529
 lego marvel super heroes we have it 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.810
 here on screen so and quickly 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.780
 well I explain to you here in this button 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.100
 of configuration and we will be able to 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.980
 customize the language in the controls 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.350
 the music the effects and then quickly 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.210
 we go to the play button here we go to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.860
 have the different missions that we are going 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.620
 to be able to play for example to 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.480
 unblock this in specific I have to 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.969
 collect five of golden bricks 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.629
 for the moment I have only three and in all 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.719
 the game in total as they are 450 each 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.819
 mission so let's say it contains your 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.109
 mission in this case are 3 for example 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:59.600
 here we are going to play is to continue 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.979
 collecting the golden bricks and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.109
 here we look at all the 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.120
 marvel superheroes of marvel forgiveness 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:07.640
 in the form of a layman, so we are going to be able to 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.229
 be choosing or buying our 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.020
 At that moment I only have unlocked 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.340
 hulk and iron man who are the characters 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.079
 initials 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.670
 so let's start with them and 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.189
 we are also going to talk about the requirements 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.990
 and details of this game here we see the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.939
 different challenges that must be achieved 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
 for example minikit picks up a mini kit 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.130
 red brick tells us picks up the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.670
 red brick and so on you 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.670
 we give in play 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.630
 and here, it does not start to show anymore 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.930
 an introduction a kinematics of 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.980
 game in our case so we're going to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.500
 skip 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.270
 and here we are already in the game as 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 come we have a joystick in the part 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 left 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.580
 we have a contraction where we can 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.620
 perform 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.620
 many effects there we have it 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.890
 there we can feel like that while 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.260
 fire I tell you that this game well what 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.670
 we can find in the place top but 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.180
 is paying a price around 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.210
 of 4 dollars the same size as it is 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.040
 of 1.8 gigabytes that you have to have in 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.590
 account but this problem to me the truth 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.480
 I liked that is good graphics your 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.010
 ability 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.989
 out of the ordinary of what 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.760
 of the waiting games we already know 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.370
 because our last ones have come out 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.230
 times as I always remember you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.209
 links in the description for both the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.340
 place bull so that those visiting do not 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.829
 They are with France if you wish or also 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.540
 in my blog spot where you will find 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.000
 all the necessary files to be able 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.830
 install you very well here we already call 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.490
 game 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.490
 bad we go 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:51.690
 I have to instruct this 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:54.750
 the list and we open the way again 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.360
 I remember Android 4.0 at least size 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.360
 of 1.8 gigabytes I do not recommend then 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.470
 maybe a gigabyte of ram memory 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.940
 so that the game runs very well since 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 you can have very good graphics 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.470
 with different 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.650
 movements and attacks like tsja against 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.060
 the head of this of this level to be able 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 to complete 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.770
 to see if we get any of lillo 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.480
 golden as always friend I invite you to 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.160

 social and with your friends so that you

 can install this game you have to 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.610
 mention that it's an offline game that 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.500
 it means that it does not need a connection 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.410
 to the internet so friends this has been 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.600
