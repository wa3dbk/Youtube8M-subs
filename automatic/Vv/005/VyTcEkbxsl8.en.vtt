 to the video of today I am laura and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.440
 let's do a makeup inspired by 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.059
 the dolce gabbana as they can be given 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.930
 when I have a special companion the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.050
 Today I have camila in the video 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.050
 Y 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.340
 if it sounds like cinnamon 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 ciao I just camila the Italian what 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.019
 first thing I did was apply a base 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.150
 of makeup and luminous I used in 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.190
 illuminate and who uses it in two tones 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 the first tone is w 5 and that's the tone 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:23.850
 that he applied all over my face using 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:26.220
 my fingers and the second tone is double 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 use that is a little darker and that's what 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 I apply in the area of ​​my cheeks and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.619
 where would the contour go? 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.409
 add warmth to the face try to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.690
 use a very small amount of bread or 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.940
 maybe less for his whole face and just 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.340
 a little bit for the darker base of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.649
 your cheeks the important thing is that you see 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.539
 very cool face like my 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.789
 base apply my concealer with my fingers 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.510
 This is soul and wake up makeup in the whole 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.700
 medium 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.580
 they need an illuminator corrector nothing 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 too light I do not like to end up with 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.600
 a brush like this double fiber 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.340
 just to make sure to soften 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.340
 any line that could be left 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 for the shadows I will use my 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.960
 bobby braun's ballet surprise I'm going to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.660
 fill my eyebrows in a way like 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.790
 very casual and very light nothing very accurate 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.560
 I'm going to use an angle brush that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.810
 be pretty hard and I'm going to apply 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:41.600
 these colors this is a pretty coffee 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:43.670
 Of course this is a dark coffee I'm going to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.010
 start using this clear gold 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.080
 that is here and I'm going to use it with 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 a soft brush on my entire eyelid 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:58.400
 mobile take a small brush and I'll go 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.860
 to moisten with droplets for 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.020
 eyes as is my case or if it has effects 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.390
 at hand do it with that and we're going to 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.310
 take the same golden tone that we apply 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.440
 in our eyelids and we 're going to 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.230
 Apply on the inside corner for 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.300
 really open the eye and give it like this 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 freshness in addition to the fact that it is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.550
 Wet the brush will intensify the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.550
 pigment 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.220
 with the same brush they applied their 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.340
 golden shade we are going to have a coffee 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.800
 medium like this that is here and we are going to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.320
 make sure to apply it in the basin 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.870
 of the eye very gently and very little with 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.090
 a very light hand and we will lower it 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.090
 to the bottom of the eyelashes 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.240
 and to finish opening the eye and give it 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.460
 truly that cool feeling and 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.010
 spring I will use a pencil 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.620
 white on the part of the water line 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.050
 or the inner part of the eye if they have one 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.000
 cream color is better I just had 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.380
 the white at hand but the cream color 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.380
 It must look a lot more natural 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.180
 now let's take a pencil eyeliner 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.400
 in my case I'm going to use this black of 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.260
 Casey order have a chocolate coffee 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.959
 it's better because it's going to be softer because 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.720
 that the pencil is very very very pointed 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 and we are going to draw a very thin line 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.790
 as close as possible to the line of the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.790
 tabs 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.220
 let's use a brush to 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.500
 very thin eyeliner and very 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.170
 pointy that gives us a lot of control and 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.300
 let's soften that line by keeping it 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.100
 very close to the line of the eyelashes not 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.280
 we want a thick eyeliner we're going to 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.290
 pull 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.450
 the end of the line and make a small 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:51.310
 little tip very discreet very 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.020
 small and very thin since we have 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.480
 our line well defined and well 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.230
 corrected if necessary we will take 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.030
 a much darker or more burned gold 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.190
 like this one that is here we are going to 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.410
 press on the black line that 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.270
 just made the chocolate or coffee 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.070
 next step you know we are going to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:24.430
 tilt our lashes and let's 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:26.590
 apply mascara for the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.060
 cheeks I used a mixture of these two 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.060
 Jordanian matte blushes 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.450
 pale pink and peach are classic 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.450
 pretty good and I'm going to use them with 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.370
 a pretty soft brush and like very 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.950
 chubby so that from a very application 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.050
 soft let's mix the two blushes and 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.150
 we are going to apply them in the part of 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.110
 our cheeks as if we painted 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.110
 down 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.740
 and then we will apply on the line 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.740
 of the hair and a little on the chin 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.780
 let's apply a mixture of lipsticks 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.570
 coral the first one that I have here is 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.320
 exposed every cord of revlon and this is 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.980
 a coral much more pink the second 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.980
 coral that I have is a little more on the side 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.980
 orange 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.320
 and we are going to use our finger to 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.320
 stir those colors very well 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.320
 incorporate them 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.490
 and well this is all for my part I hope 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.860
