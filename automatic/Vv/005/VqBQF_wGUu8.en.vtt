the<00:00:15.480> gh<00:00:16.379> 2<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.100> renowned<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.670> its<00:00:17.880> video

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
the gh 2 is renowned for its video

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.700 
the gh 2 is renowned for its video
photography<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:21.510> sensor<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.470> use

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
photography the sensor now that we use

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.480 
photography the sensor now that we use
in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> g5<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.600> similar<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.230> gh<00:00:25.560> 2<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
in the g5 is very similar to the gh 2 so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.250 
in the g5 is very similar to the gh 2 so
the<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:27.119> rate<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.720> output<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the bit rate or the output the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929 
the bit rate or the output the
smoothness<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> film<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
smoothness of the film so to the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
smoothness of the film so to the
consumer<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> means<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> consumer

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
consumer what that means to the consumer

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.729 
consumer what that means to the consumer
is<00:00:32.000> you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.120> how<00:00:33.300> smoother<00:00:33.870> each<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is you know how smoother each one is the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
is you know how smoother each one is the
gh<00:00:35.100> 2<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> far<00:00:36.260> far<00:00:37.260> superior<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
gh 2 is far far superior in a way to the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.660 
gh 2 is far far superior in a way to the
g5<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> same<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.550> both

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
g5 but at the same time with both

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.190 
g5 but at the same time with both
cameras<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.050> obviously

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
cameras what you can do is obviously

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
cameras what you can do is obviously
change<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> lenses<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> wanted<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
change the lenses so if you wanted to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
change the lenses so if you wanted to
telephoto<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.610> shot<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> wide-angle<00:00:48.660> lens

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
telephoto the shot or a wide-angle lens

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
telephoto the shot or a wide-angle lens
in<00:00:49.530> video<00:00:49.890> mode<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.030> creative<00:00:51.539> from

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
in video mode you can be creative from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
in video mode you can be creative from
all<00:00:52.289> different<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> moment<00:00:53.219> we've<00:00:53.309> got<00:00:53.370> 16

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
all different at the moment we've got 16

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
all different at the moment we've got 16
lenses<00:00:54.239> behind<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.289> do<00:00:55.469> different

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
lenses behind this to do different

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
lenses behind this to do different
different<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.460> know<00:00:56.550> shoot<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> different

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
different you know shoot in different

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.029 
different you know shoot in different
subject<00:00:57.690> matters<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.170> different<00:00:58.559> conditions

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
subject matters as different conditions

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.360 
subject matters as different conditions
so<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> by<00:01:00.480> both<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:00.989> gh<00:01:01.559> 2<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so you can do that by both but gh 2 is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
so you can do that by both but gh 2 is
very<00:01:02.789> famous<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.359> fact<00:01:03.660> recently<00:01:04.170> was

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
very famous in fact recently was

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.750 
very famous in fact recently was
reviewed<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:06.290> its<00:01:07.290> video<00:01:07.590> output<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> got

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
reviewed for its video output and got

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.370 
reviewed for its video output and got
you<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.080> number<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you know it's been out for a number of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
you know it's been out for a number of
years<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.830> still<00:01:10.860> high<00:01:11.670> performing<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
years and is still high performing but

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
years and is still high performing but
but<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> tough<00:01:13.680> question<00:01:13.890> coming<00:01:14.340> there

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
but still a tough question coming there

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
but still a tough question coming there
because<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.659> an<00:01:15.869> expert<00:01:16.290> there

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799

to tell them like which one is the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.570 
to tell them like which one is the

for<00:01:24.600> 7<00:01:24.990> reason<00:01:25.229> also<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.650> been<00:01:25.830> along<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
for 7 reason also it's been along on the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
for 7 reason also it's been along on the
market<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> g5<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.829> say

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
market in the g5 but can you really say

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.670 
market in the g5 but can you really say
that<00:01:29.310> easy<00:01:29.880> which<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> better<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that easy which one is better you just

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
that easy which one is better you just
can<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.400> close<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> very

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
can well it's very close it is very

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
can well it's very close it is very
close<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.619> gives<00:01:34.979> us<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
close and that just gives us the you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
close and that just gives us the you
know<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> shows<00:01:36.689> where<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> technology<00:01:37.710> in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
know that shows where the technology in

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.870 
know that shows where the technology in
the<00:01:37.950> g5<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.790> has<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:39.780> over<00:01:40.590> since<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> gh<00:01:41.610> 2

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the g5 now has come over since the gh 2

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
the g5 now has come over since the gh 2
was<00:01:42.030> released<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.450> few<00:01:42.600> years<00:01:42.659> ago<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
was released a few years ago so it is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.399 
was released a few years ago so it is
very<00:01:44.189> close<00:01:44.430> together<00:01:44.930> but<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.200> still

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
very close together but we just still

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.749 
very close together but we just still
had<00:01:46.530> an<00:01:46.619> answer<00:01:46.950> really<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> close

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
had an answer really is that close

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.950 
had an answer really is that close
together<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.570> one<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.869> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
together is like which one would you
