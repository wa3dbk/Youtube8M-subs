00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 a return on the chase steeplechase with 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.270
 ambitions 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.469
 a choice that will once again played 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.329
 the leading roles he's always 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.740
 presented wisely and especially the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.409
 quality does not fail him 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.619
 the 607 brunel licorice that comes from 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.180
 to make his comeback on the brooms and well 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.700
 should show progress and deserve 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.879
 also a note of distrust on this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 steeple-chase 600 1 602 607 for a 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.690
 eventual couple and in this sixth 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.980
 go in the 8th know that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.010
 Gregory Linder It's not negative 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.840
 with the 807 palmerino on horseback which has 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.580
 run in flat that will start on the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.720
 obstacles goes very well morning they 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.640
 give complete satisfaction 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.319
 a horse of quality very applied in 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.000
 his jumps and in the entourage 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.280
 we would not be surprised by the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 see well running straight away directly 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 in the discipline so a beautiful underdog 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.300
 in my eyes able to finish on the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.560
 podium the 807 palmerino estimated by the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.090
 family linders the 801 balm boys who 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.680
 won for his debut in the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.290
 discipline it was on the danger forums 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.480
 last month should also repeated 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.519
 in this lot in any case he will leave 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.830
 logically supported betting 1807 and 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.200
 801 race also blair auteuil 6th and 8th 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.300
 in Bordeaux in meeting 2 I could 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.489
 kodak christmas langlois he is confident with 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.720
 the 105 al capone the horse comes from 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.790
 to prevail pleasantly with brio and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.319
 facility on this bordeaux track a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.840
 expected confirmation he likes on 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.430
 this track the 103 bustier that comes 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480
 prove his good form in greece on 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.030
 excellent results in cagnes-sur-mer 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 will be directly opposed to him 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.090
 also to urzy belline sounds 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.530
 she seems barred for the victory 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.209
 but she's extremely regular she 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.590
 knows how to finish his shopping and in my opinion the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.599
 third place can get him back 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.030
 a christophe hamel is not negative 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.560

 bordeaux in the next the third 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.530
 Recommend to you from 309 cases la rosa est

 simply undefeated in two outings 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.799
 this year 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.180
 since the beginning of the 2015 financial year nothing 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.189

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.210

 confident in his opinion the horse has 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.630
 the money to take he does not have the gains 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.700
 in relation to its potential 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.870
 it is better to trust him 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.050
 must forgive him these disqualifications 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.250
 where the horse was often embarrassed often 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.320
 disqualified there is a beautiful 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.180
 opportunity to highlight Christmas 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.330

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
 for this back-to-school race you have to 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.170

 July 2013 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.190
 but christophe hamel explained to me 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.540
 that she had problems that she had 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.010
 still a little work she 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.000
 is not 100% his means but 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.650
 it has enough qualities to 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.850
 to make the arrival English because the lot did 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.880
