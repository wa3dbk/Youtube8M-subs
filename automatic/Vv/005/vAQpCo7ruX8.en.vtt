00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
version down here which actually I don't

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.289

think you can see weeks my mouse so it

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.050 
think you can see weeks my mouse so it
would<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.510> down<00:02:58.660> here<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:59.579> then<00:03:00.579> you<00:03:00.940> would

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
would be down here and then you would

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.060 
would be down here and then you would
find<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.540> version<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.140> want<00:03:02.380> click<00:03:02.590> on

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.390 

and<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.230> once<00:03:20.439> it<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.590> loaded<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.069> go<00:03:21.340> to

your<00:03:21.640> single<00:03:22.510> player<00:03:22.780> one<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.640> scroll<00:03:24.939> down

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
your single player one you scroll down

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.259 
your single player one you scroll down
to<00:03:27.760> find<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.530> one<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:30.579> had<00:03:30.819> which

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
to find the one that you just had which

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.149 
to find the one that you just had which
this<00:03:31.450> was<00:03:31.629> the<00:03:31.810> tutorial<00:03:32.319> one<00:03:32.469> it'll<00:03:32.709> say<00:03:32.920> in
