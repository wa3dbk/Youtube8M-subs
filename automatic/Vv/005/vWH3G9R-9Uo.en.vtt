now<00:00:01.410> we're<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.829> look<00:00:01.949> at<00:00:02.190> a<00:00:02.220> profile<00:00:02.820> I

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
now we're going to look at a profile I

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.599 
now we're going to look at a profile I
and<00:00:03.540> while<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.290> can<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.710> it<00:00:04.799> yourself<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.400> at

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
and while you can do it yourself with at

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.030 
and while you can do it yourself with at
least<00:00:05.759> two<00:00:06.299> mirrors<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:07.410> probably<00:00:07.740> easy<00:00:07.919> to

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
least two mirrors it's probably easy to

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.220 
least two mirrors it's probably easy to
do<00:00:08.250> somebody<00:00:08.610> else<00:00:08.790> as<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.200> so<00:00:12.049> what<00:00:13.049> we're

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
do somebody else as I so what we're

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
do somebody else as I so what we're
looking<00:00:13.530> at<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.340> still<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.820> sphere<00:00:15.299> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
looking at here is still a sphere so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.550 
looking at here is still a sphere so
still<00:00:16.109> put<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.650> round<00:00:16.859> circle<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> now

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
still put on your round circle and now

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.189 
still put on your round circle and now
we're<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.430> how<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.720> eyelid

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
we're going to look at how the eyelid

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.640 
we're going to look at how the eyelid
sits<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:23.039> circle<00:00:23.900> this<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> area

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
sits on this circle this is the area

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790 
sits on this circle this is the area
above<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> eye<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
above the eye in here we have the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.940 
above the eye in here we have the
eyebrow<00:00:29.310> coming<00:00:29.789> towards<00:00:30.150> us<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> eyelid

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
eyebrow coming towards us and the eyelid

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.729 
eyebrow coming towards us and the eyelid
will<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.370> cutting<00:00:35.610> across<00:00:36.079> on<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> shape<00:00:37.500> like

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
will be cutting across on a shape like

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.510 
will be cutting across on a shape like
this<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:42.719> upper<00:00:43.050> lid<00:00:43.230> will<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.770> protruding

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this the upper lid will be protruding

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.810 
this the upper lid will be protruding
beyond<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.629> lower<00:00:45.809> lid

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
beyond the lower lid

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
beyond the lower lid
unless<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.059> course<00:00:48.090> names<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
unless of course names now you get to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.270 
unless of course names now you get to
see<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.309> eyelashes<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:54.559> see<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.890> smaller

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
see the eyelashes you see a much smaller

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
see the eyelashes you see a much smaller
portion<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> eye<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.770> are

portion of the eye and what you are
seeing<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.149> colored<00:01:00.570> portion<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> eye

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
seeing of the colored portion of the eye

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
seeing of the colored portion of the eye
is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:02.489> convex<00:01:03.030> shape<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.600> no<00:01:03.780> longer

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is a convex shape it's no longer

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.310 
is a convex shape it's no longer
circular<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:05.040> note<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.270> front<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
circular do note that the front of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.660 
circular do note that the front of the
eye<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:07.950> seen<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.280> profile<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.650> actually

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
eye when seen in profile is actually

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.710 
eye when seen in profile is actually
transparent<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:14.150> cornea<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> colored

part<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.170> eye<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.619> situated<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
part of the eye will be situated a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
part of the eye will be situated a
little<00:01:17.729> distance<00:01:18.119> back<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.049> thicker

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little distance back from that thicker

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
little distance back from that thicker
transparent<00:01:20.100> layer<00:01:20.630> you'll<00:01:21.630> still<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
transparent layer you'll still have your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
transparent layer you'll still have your
shading<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> corner<00:01:23.250> depending<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.820> what

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
shading and the corner depending on what

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
shading and the corner depending on what
your<00:01:24.119> light<00:01:24.270> source<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.810> doing<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.470> then

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
your light source was doing and then

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.640 
your light source was doing and then
they'll<00:01:25.799> usually<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.610> quite<00:01:26.820> strong

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
they'll usually be some quite strong

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.910 
they'll usually be some quite strong
shadows<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.729> section<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.680> which<00:01:31.680> will

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
shadows in the section here which will

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.810 
shadows in the section here which will
kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.220> throw<00:01:32.520> your<00:01:32.820> eye<00:01:33.530> into<00:01:34.530> relief

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

so<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.970> take<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.330> ball

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so if we take the ball

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.590 
so if we take the ball
I'm<00:01:43.560> ball<00:01:43.890> away<00:01:44.190> now<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.750> left<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I'm ball away now and we left with the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.720 
I'm ball away now and we left with the
shape<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.050> we're<00:01:49.170> looking<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.220> you'll

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
shape that we're looking at so you'll

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.370 
shape that we're looking at so you'll
see<00:01:53.910> a<00:01:53.940> much<00:01:54.150> smaller<00:01:54.570> portion<00:01:54.870> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.230> eye

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
see a much smaller portion of the eye

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
see a much smaller portion of the eye
when<00:01:55.980> you're<00:01:56.130> looking<00:01:56.340> at<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.730> profile

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
when you're looking at it and profile

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870 
when you're looking at it and profile
don't<00:01:58.560> exaggerate<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.400> or<00:01:59.550> make<00:01:59.730> it<00:01:59.760> look

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
don't exaggerate it or make it look

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:13.010 
don't exaggerate it or make it look
larger<00:02:00.420> than<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.660> needs<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:12.780> this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
larger than it needs to be in this

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.930 
larger than it needs to be in this
section<00:02:13.230> we're<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> look<00:02:13.830> at<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.280> 3/4

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
section we're going to look at the 3/4

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.670 
section we're going to look at the 3/4
eyes<00:02:15.120> which<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.540> slightly<00:02:15.720> more<00:02:15.990> complicated

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
eyes which are slightly more complicated

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.880 
eyes which are slightly more complicated
than<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> front<00:02:17.130> own<00:02:17.400> eyes<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:17.910> profile<00:02:18.890> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
than the front own eyes or profile it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.080 
than the front own eyes or profile it
was<00:02:20.160> also<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.490> one<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.670> you're<00:02:20.850> probably

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
was also the one that you're probably

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.270 
was also the one that you're probably
going<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.450> end<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.690> using<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.230> most<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.920> with

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to end up using the most and with

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.460 
going to end up using the most and with
this<00:02:23.460> generally<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> head<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.810> tilted<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.290> one

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
this generally the head is tilted in one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.080 
this generally the head is tilted in one
direction<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.250> eyes<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.850> looking

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
direction but the eyes will be looking

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.480 
direction but the eyes will be looking
at<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.590> going<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.920> give<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.130> pose

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
at you and this is going to give a pose

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.870 
at you and this is going to give a pose
that<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.820> more<00:02:30.210> natural<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.110> relaxed<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
that is more natural and relaxed and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.250 
that is more natural and relaxed and
have<00:02:32.880> perhaps<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.270> more<00:02:33.420> sense<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.840> movement

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
have perhaps a more sense of movement

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.170 
have perhaps a more sense of movement
because<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.590> feel<00:02:34.830> at<00:02:34.950> any<00:02:35.070> point<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.820> person

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
because you feel at any point the person

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.110 
because you feel at any point the person
could<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.450> moving<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.520> different<00:02:38.910> things

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
could be moving so the different things

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.080 
could be moving so the different things
to<00:02:39.270> notice<00:02:39.510> about<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.790> will

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to notice about this is that one I will

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.060 
to notice about this is that one I will
be<00:02:42.209> closer<00:02:42.510> towards<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> will<00:02:43.950> be

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
be closer towards you and will be

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.100 
be closer towards you and will be
slightly<00:02:44.340> larger<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.750> eye<00:02:45.780> that's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
slightly larger and the eye that's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.140 
slightly larger and the eye that's
further<00:02:46.380> away<00:02:46.709> will<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:47.010> slowly<00:02:47.250> smaller<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
further away will be slowly smaller and

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.600 
further away will be slowly smaller and
the<00:02:48.810> eye<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.260> further<00:02:49.620> away<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.370> tear

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the eye that is further away the tear

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.310 
the eye that is further away the tear
ducts<00:02:50.880> will<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.239> hidden<00:02:51.450> by<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.870> bridge<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
ducts will be hidden by the bridge of

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.610 
ducts will be hidden by the bridge of
the<00:02:52.410> nose

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the nose

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.060 
the nose
so<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.280> case<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.820> can't<00:02:54.300> see<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.769> owners

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
so in this case I can't see the owners

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.100 
so in this case I can't see the owners
right<00:02:56.250> eye<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.670> can't<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.180> her<00:02:57.360> tear<00:02:57.570> duct<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
right eye I can't see her tear duct and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930 
right eye I can't see her tear duct and
it's<00:02:58.830> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> make<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.340> eyes<00:02:59.489> have<00:02:59.910> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
it's going to make the eyes have a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
it's going to make the eyes have a
slightly<00:03:00.300> different<00:03:00.720> shape<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.019> we<00:03:01.410> need<00:03:01.590> to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
slightly different shape so we need to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.670 
slightly different shape so we need to
pay<00:03:01.860> attention<00:03:01.890> carefully<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.470> and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
pay attention carefully to see it and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.990 
pay attention carefully to see it and
communicate<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.550> sense<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:06.000> shape<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> in

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
communicate that sense of shape so in

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.610 
communicate that sense of shape so in
this<00:03:09.209> dark<00:03:09.540> place<00:03:09.750> here<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.110> I'm<00:03:10.410> going<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this dark place here now I'm going to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.390 
this dark place here now I'm going to
start<00:03:10.860> with<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.489> nose<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:12.150> edge<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> nose

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
start with the nose the edge of the nose

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.420 
start with the nose the edge of the nose
and<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.880> eyebrows<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:18.769> look<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:20.100> now<00:03:20.370> for

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and the eyebrows and look here now for

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.310 
and the eyebrows and look here now for
what's<00:03:20.850> happening<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.300> each<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.200> that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
what's happening that each of that

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.900 
what's happening that each of that
eyelid<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.920> disappearing<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:26.340> top<00:03:26.760> of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
eyelid is disappearing and the top of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.660 
eyelid is disappearing and the top of
the<00:03:27.060> eye<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.300> straight<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.709> now<00:03:28.920> I'm<00:03:29.250> seeing

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the eye is straight but now I'm seeing

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.150 
the eye is straight but now I'm seeing
that<00:03:30.000> curved<00:03:30.450> side<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.290> eyeball<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
that curved side on the eyeball this is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.120 
that curved side on the eyeball this is
quite<00:03:32.370> important<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.420> curve<00:03:33.780> as<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.950> is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
quite important that curve as this is

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.199 
quite important that curve as this is
indicating<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.790> me<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:37.170> view<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.850> rest<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
indicating to me the view so the rest of

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.259 
indicating to me the view so the rest of
the<00:03:42.330> island<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.750> disappearing<00:03:43.410> behind<00:03:44.269> but

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
the island is disappearing behind but

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.449 
the island is disappearing behind but
the<00:03:45.450> curve<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.110> eyeball<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:47.190> quite

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
the curve of the eyeball is quite

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.570 
the curve of the eyeball is quite
apparent<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.269> curves<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.810> there

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.220 

on<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> that's<00:03:55.090> closer<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.630> me<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:58.020> can<00:03:59.020> see

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
on the I that's closer to me I can see

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.589 
on the I that's closer to me I can see
and<00:03:59.380> hear<00:03:59.440> that

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.559 

it's<00:04:07.079> gonna<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.409> slightly<00:04:07.709> larger

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
it's gonna be slightly larger

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.360 
it's gonna be slightly larger
perspective

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.060 

in<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.209> view<00:04:16.570> it's<00:04:16.720> more<00:04:16.989> easy<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.380> see<00:04:17.709> that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
in this view it's more easy to see that

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.740 
in this view it's more easy to see that
the<00:04:18.280> lower<00:04:18.489> letters<00:04:18.940> disappearing<00:04:19.660> that

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
the lower letters disappearing that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.610 
the lower letters disappearing that
behind<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:21.100> upper<00:04:21.370> lid<00:04:22.050> and<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.290> is<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
behind the upper lid and this is the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.330 
behind the upper lid and this is the
sense<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:24.040> here<00:04:24.340> I<00:04:24.610> have<00:04:25.110> this<00:04:26.110> eye<00:04:26.410> in<00:04:26.860> here

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
sense in here I have this eye in here

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.530 
sense in here I have this eye in here
this<00:04:27.790> was<00:04:27.970> around<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.510> threw<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.139> shadow<00:04:33.540> can

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
this was around I threw the shadow can

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.120 
this was around I threw the shadow can
look<00:04:34.720> for<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.020> shape<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.650> white<00:04:35.830> of<00:04:36.100> the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
look for the shape of the white of the

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.350 
look for the shape of the white of the
eye<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.400> get<00:04:36.850> where<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> eyeball<00:04:38.139> is<00:04:39.210> same<00:04:40.210> on

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
eye to get where the eyeball is same on

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.719 
eye to get where the eyeball is same on
this<00:04:40.510> side

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.010 

usually<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.850> eyeball<00:04:46.270> will<00:04:46.479> be<00:04:46.600> partly

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
usually the eyeball will be partly

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.420 
usually the eyeball will be partly
hidden<00:04:47.260> at<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.860> top<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.340> bottom<00:04:48.520> by<00:04:48.970> the<00:04:49.030> lid

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
hidden at the top and bottom by the lid

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.830 
hidden at the top and bottom by the lid
it's<00:04:51.430> not<00:04:51.639> very<00:04:51.850> often<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.240> you're<00:04:52.479> going<00:04:52.720> to

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
it's not very often that you're going to

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.020 
it's not very often that you're going to
see<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.800> whites<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.490> eyes<00:04:57.000> it's<00:04:58.000> like

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
see the whites of the eyes it's like

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:06.190 
see the whites of the eyes it's like
reflection<00:04:58.750> on<00:04:58.870> this<00:04:59.050> side

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:16.530 

you<00:05:07.570> can<00:05:08.570> see<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.200> lashes<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.770> profile

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:24.010 

putting<00:05:17.540> away<00:05:17.660> now<00:05:17.930> I<00:05:22.420> can<00:05:23.420> see<00:05:23.600> a<00:05:23.630> bit<00:05:23.780> more<00:05:23.810> of

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
putting away now I can see a bit more of

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.070 
putting away now I can see a bit more of
the<00:05:24.110> lid<00:05:24.380> in<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:24.980> case<00:05:25.250> here<00:05:25.520> cooing<00:05:26.120> and

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
down inside here and this one I can make

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.730 
down inside here and this one I can make
more<00:05:35.000> definition<00:05:35.630> in<00:05:35.780> terms<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:36.290> the<00:05:36.530> tear

this little shape just here I mean it's

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.600 
this little shape just here I mean it's
a<00:05:43.730> three-quarter<00:05:44.240> eye<00:05:45.190> when<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.310> comes<00:05:46.460> to

looking at you on the first example I've
made<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.230> eyes<00:06:00.470> too<00:06:01.010> far<00:06:01.400> over<00:06:01.730> at<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.210> bottom

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
made the eyes too far over at the bottom

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.380

here<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.110> too<00:06:03.740> far<00:06:04.250> over<00:06:04.580> to<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:04.880> right<00:06:05.000> at

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
here and too far over to the right at

the top I mean when I corrected it you

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.280 
the top I mean when I corrected it you
can<00:06:10.280> see<00:06:10.430> what<00:06:10.580> a<00:06:10.610> difference<00:06:10.970> it's<00:06:11.150> made<00:06:11.360> just

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
can see what a difference it's made just

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.960 
can see what a difference it's made just
by<00:06:12.410> bringing<00:06:12.650> the<00:06:12.800> eye<00:06:12.830> further<00:06:13.280> over<00:06:13.520> the
