00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 good morning everyone and for now and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.859
 welcome to the information of the world 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 of pokemon as you know the week 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
 last I brought you a video announcing 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 that day 26 without announcing with a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 Japan program etc. and so on a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.080
 new pokémon game that we do not know 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.730
 practically nothing and that it will break a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 bunch of what's going to be the little faith that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.439
 little around poking to etcetera and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 obviously that game has been very well 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.820
 guys today to the day August 26 has been 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.010
 filtering has been announced rather a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 new game of pokémon for recreational 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 in Japan but it will be out in Europe 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.390
 It will be in Europe and in consoles 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 of nintendo because almost almost could almost 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.140
 put it in the fire of what if when that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.520
 is what he gave us so guys we're going 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 for there we are going to analyze this game 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.239
 let's analyze the trailer so 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 and say everything with everything 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.969
 that's because you're going with weapons against 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 he is a teaser so to speak in the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.399
 that announce the name of the game comes out in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.289
 a new pokémon and graphics come out 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.059
 of the game that I find spectacular 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.520
 honestly one thing that can move the 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 wiiu without problems is that it is not a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.399
 let say 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 a game many graphics graphics 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 spectacular but I think neither 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.850
 you need it in we sign with it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
 I bring you a video talking about 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.100
 Nintendo had registered two names 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.200
 the names of pokemon fighters and poker 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 tournament very well because it seems that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.229
 these pokémon games that I said that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 they can be fight etc. and so on 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.640
 I said I mean last year I said the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 really quite funny that I said 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.110
 it could be a mix between pokemon and you 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 you burn created by the name of epoc in 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.850
 that double-sided 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 It takes duplicate that both do 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.569
 names of people you do not know that the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.939
 name you stay with two cash and pocket 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.039
 I said why do not they sin or something like that because 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.380
 his face is bent so to speak 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.149
 because it seems that because of that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.500
 bandai that are the creators are the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.740
 designers are the developers 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 better said of tekken and soul calibur 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.060
 they are after this game they walk 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 developing this game that will come out as 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.819
 order as I repeat in 2015 poch around 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.490
 a bet confirmed 100% will go 2015 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.689
 for recreational only and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.890
 exclusively from Japan the games that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.160
 are the pokemon sorry they are 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.859
 within this game announced 100% 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.020
 official are look ario mega lúcar me mega 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.250
 basic in play follow and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.510
 will go on how are you watching on screen 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.820
 the time is that the graphics seem to me 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 very good nothing has come out of gameplay 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.270
 with the juli in plan the typical gameplay 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.070
 of a lifetime that you could be 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.230
 playing like nothing has come out as an single 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.060
 a teaser comes out with a trailer like that in 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.100
 moves in the monkey is in time 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.420
 real power the graphics of the game well 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.250
 that the game will look if obviously 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.070
 but we still do not know the movements 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.110
 nor if it will be in 3d or in street plan 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.280
 fighter we know practically nothing the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.110
 graphical section as is quite 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000
 decent I can move the wiiu without 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.620
 problems I say and last year 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.190
 as I say it registered little in fighters and 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.860
 little environment in Japan in the USA and in 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 europe very well now speaking of white 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.740
 and from the white moments you know that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.450
 white as I say in the develops 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.880
 of the tec in and it seems that you in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.640
 Japan has always been out a couple of years or 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.980
 one year before, always in recreational activities 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.450
 in consoles for example the tekken 6 the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.580
 tekken 6 that the known the world the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.830
 franchise tekken as the tekken 6 came out 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.080
 in 2007 for recreational in japan and a 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.020
 year and a half later he left for 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.430
 normally not for xbox 360 this list 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.920
 it's fine for playstation3 and I do not 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.840
 I do not know if it came out or I do not think 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.890
 well I will say that it came out also for pc 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.900
 but good especially for the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.330
 strong consoles that was xbox 360 in that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.489
 moment in 2009 and playstation3 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.520
 malefo because he is telling me this 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.780
 for good because white is the 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.670
 distributor so to speak along with 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.050
 an intern of this new because fighters 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.660
 smell of sherrod you're I do not know what's wrong 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.950
 to the bank but they were committing a lot of cane in 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.810
 the recreational ones is therefore type that 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.270
 around me I will be first in 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.430
 recreational in japan but insurance for sure 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.069
 sure that next year is to say yes 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.080
 the game comes out in 2015 for 2016 or 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.430
 We see end of mismamente 2015 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.920
 when is this little in fighters because 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.200
 around me forgive me in japan it will come out 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.420
 also for the wii u will not be in 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.950
 nintendo sony consoles neither of nor of 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.280
 micro enough will go out for the wii 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.160
 u the following year that is to say in 2016 in 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.200
 2017 or the end of 2015 will surely be 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.310
 confirm when the own little bit of 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.900
 a lathe I put when I wear the little 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.850
 environment gets in the market in the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.069
 recreational a few months so 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.540
 guys quiet everyone but 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.010
 Nintendo would not have registered 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.260
 marks because in fight if little around 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.340
 mind in the USA and in Europe they do not have 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.019
 no kind of sense because the neighborhood 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.669
 do not go out leaves 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.199
 so they register the marks because 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.580
 angry and little environment med does not have 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.979
 no kind of sense and it is also a 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.599
 game that surely many people will want 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.930
 have many people in your own home 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:35.759
 will want we go that is that without any doubt 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.470
 is a sells consoles is that is that in 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.080
 a game of pokémon but fights is 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.669
 I do not know not that I do not know what's coming 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.139
 head to nintendo do not put this game 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.490
 for water me but I do I say and 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.930
 confirmed almost one hundred percent of that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.060
 this game is going to be for the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.740
 nintendo wii or for 3ds very 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.060
 probably not more than anything for the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.800
 graphics there could be a gradient 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.979
 etcetera etcetera but I do not think it is 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.020
 for 3ds more than anything because for the 3ds 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.300
 there are already Pokémon games like 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.530
 example pokemon x6 or mega blond pokemon 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.819
 and alpha sapphire 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.020
 just like that guys but I like this 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.720
 information video I hope you have 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.009
 liked this touch environment med maybe 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.259
 leave because environment is only for 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.250
 recreational and then little in fighter 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.750
 because they have not said anything about pocket 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.520
 fighters and it's also a brand that 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.319
 recorded nintendo maybe I do not know are a 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.909
 game because fighters for consoles and 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.349
 little environment mind only be for 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.240
 recreational soap but good without 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.620
 no doubt quiet guys that all 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.599
 the world that has a union at home 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.909
 will end up playing this generation to 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.710
 a fighting game at most taken but 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.180
