is<00:00:03.330> our<00:00:03.449> asphalt<00:00:03.659> estimating<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.710> job

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
is our asphalt estimating and job

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.980 
is our asphalt estimating and job
costing<00:00:05.339> software<00:00:05.819> called<00:00:06.089> asphalt<00:00:06.690> trigger

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
costing software called asphalt trigger

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.919 
costing software called asphalt trigger
it<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> web-based<00:00:08.250> program<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.599> would

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it is a web-based program so you would

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.440 
it is a web-based program so you would
get<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.139> custom<00:00:10.590> URL<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.580> would<00:00:11.700> get<00:00:11.910> custom

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
get a custom URL you would get custom

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
get a custom URL you would get custom
user<00:00:12.660> names<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.170> passwords<00:00:13.590> for<00:00:13.950> security

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
all right now this is the labor section

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.719 
all right now this is the labor section
and<00:01:17.319> again<00:01:17.499> we're<00:01:17.829> just<00:01:18.009> kind<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.460> showing<00:01:18.640> you

how it works there are so many options
with<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.789> program<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.509> we<00:01:23.140> would<00:01:23.289> love<00:01:23.469> to

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
with this program and we would love to

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.770 
with this program and we would love to
show<00:01:23.859> them<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:24.009> you<00:01:24.159> but<00:01:24.549> time<00:01:25.240> does<00:01:25.479> not<00:01:25.509> allow

any one of these buttons here's the
beauty<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.820> figured<00:01:45.120> 50<00:01:45.510> tons<00:01:45.720> per<00:01:45.960> hour<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
beauty we figured 50 tons per hour and

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.430 
beauty we figured 50 tons per hour and
tons<00:01:46.830> remaining<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.000> want<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:49.080> regard

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
tons remaining we want that with regard

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.190 
tons remaining we want that with regard
to<00:01:49.500> hauling<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.790> zero<00:01:51.210> negative<00:01:51.600> number

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
to hauling to be a zero negative number

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.690 
to hauling to be a zero negative number
I<00:01:52.320> figured<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.310> six<00:01:53.610> wheelers<00:01:54.050> at<00:01:55.050> 13<00:01:55.860> tons<00:01:56.160> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
I figured my six wheelers at 13 tons you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210 
I figured my six wheelers at 13 tons you
can<00:01:56.880> figure<00:01:57.090> am<00:01:57.300> at<00:01:57.480> 14<00:01:58.020> tons<00:01:58.260> or<00:01:58.440> 12<00:01:58.800> tonnes<00:01:59.070> or

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
can figure am at 14 tons or 12 tonnes or

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.550 
can figure am at 14 tons or 12 tonnes or
however<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.820> want<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> alright<00:02:01.230> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
however you want to do it alright and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.740 
however you want to do it alright and
you<00:02:01.650> see<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:01.980> got<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.160> negative<00:02:02.400> -<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.630> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you see we got a negative - now we have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.310 
you see we got a negative - now we have
our<00:02:03.990> extras<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.770> we're<00:02:04.950> put<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.310> striping<00:02:06.320> we

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
our extras and we're put in striping we

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.390 
our extras and we're put in striping we
got<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.800> quantity<00:02:08.810> 300<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:10.050> hit<00:02:10.170> add<00:02:10.410> now

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
got a one quantity 300 we'll hit add now

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
got a one quantity 300 we'll hit add now
here's<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.820> nice<00:02:12.030> thing<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:13.020> get<00:02:13.170> a

here's the nice thing is if we get a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.400 
here's the nice thing is if we get a
better<00:02:13.350> price<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.340> edit<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.230> we

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
better price we can edit it and we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.949 
better price we can edit it and we
cannot<00:02:16.650> add<00:02:16.890> several<00:02:17.400> other<00:02:17.640> things<00:02:17.730> okay<00:02:18.720> we
