shoulder of the tire clearly operates at

shoulder of the tire clearly operates at

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
a higher temperature than the other and

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.219 
a higher temperature than the other and
this<00:01:08.950> requires<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.640> use<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:09.990> asymmetric<00:01:10.990> rear

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
this requires the use of asymmetric rear

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.699 
this requires the use of asymmetric rear
tires<00:01:12.749> excess<00:01:13.749> temperature<00:01:14.020> can<00:01:14.499> have<00:01:14.679> a

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:14.709 
tires excess temperature can have a

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:16.499 
tires excess temperature can have a
negative<00:01:14.979> effect<00:01:15.340> on<00:01:15.759> performance<00:01:15.999> and

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
negative effect on performance and

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.429 
negative effect on performance and
durability

durability

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.709 
durability
so<00:01:17.920> asymmetric<00:01:18.759> rear<00:01:18.969> tires<00:01:19.329> use<00:01:19.689> a

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
so asymmetric rear tires use a

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.480 
so asymmetric rear tires use a
combination<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.649> harder<00:01:21.069> and<00:01:21.280> softer
