so<00:01:21.170> this<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:23.369> problem<00:01:24.000> is

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
so this this this problem is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.060 
so this this this problem is
traditionally<00:01:25.320> called<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.689> panas<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.070> it's

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
traditionally called a panas and it's

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.270 
traditionally called a panas and it's
probably<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.320> problem<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> German

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
probably in a it's a problem in German

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
probably in a it's a problem in German
Shepherds<00:01:33.799> particularly<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.659> an<00:01:36.659> immune

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Shepherds particularly and an immune

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.850 
Shepherds particularly and an immune
situation<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.820> eye<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:40.259> surface<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
situation where the eye the surface of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.600 
situation where the eye the surface of
the<00:01:40.950> cornea<00:01:41.220> has<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> inflammation

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
the cornea has a lot of inflammation

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.990 
the cornea has a lot of inflammation
chronic<00:01:44.610> inflammation<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
chronic inflammation and it and then it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.149 
chronic inflammation and it and then it
will<00:01:48.530> develop<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.810> larger<00:01:52.710> area

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
will develop into this this larger area

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.700 
will develop into this this larger area
so<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.970> order<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.170> develop<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so in order to get it not to develop in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.910 
so in order to get it not to develop in
that<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.579> medication

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
that we're going to use some medication

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
that we're going to use some medication
daling<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.189> order<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.700> keep<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.270> bay<00:02:02.540> panas

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
daling in order to keep it at bay panas

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.749 
daling in order to keep it at bay panas
and<00:02:03.750> German<00:02:04.079> Shepherds<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> thought<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.670> an

inherited thing and you can see in this

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.589 
inherited thing and you can see in this
German<00:02:27.280> Shepherd<00:02:27.310> Dog<00:02:27.760> which<00:02:28.120> are<00:02:28.299> prone<00:02:28.569> to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
steroid will decrease the inflammation

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.280 
steroid will decrease the inflammation
and<00:03:02.620> we<00:03:02.680> use<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.129> on<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.730> off<00:03:03.970> every<00:03:04.540> few

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
and we use that on and off every few

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.009 
and we use that on and off every few
weeks<00:03:05.560> as<00:03:05.889> we<00:03:06.099> go<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.939> panis<00:03:07.389> is<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.569> disease

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
weeks as we go so panis is a disease

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.190 
weeks as we go so panis is a disease
that's<00:03:08.349> caused<00:03:08.889> by<00:03:09.159> inflammation<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.780> the

German<00:03:17.889> Shepherds<00:03:18.250> are<00:03:18.370> prone<00:03:18.669> to<00:03:18.699> the<00:03:19.150> cornea

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
German Shepherds are prone to the cornea

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.580 
German Shepherds are prone to the cornea

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.229 
being non not resistant to that type of
irritation<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.310> requires<00:03:24.669> a<00:03:24.819> lot<00:03:25.150> of

irritation so it requires a lot of
lifelong<00:03:25.599> treatment<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.470> we<00:03:26.859> want<00:03:27.069> to
