00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
feedback about the class and you know
what<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.049> guys<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> use<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> your

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
what what you guys like to use on your

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
what what you guys like to use on your
classes<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.460> anyway<00:01:44.700> let's<00:01:45.240> move<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
classes but anyway let's move on to the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.249 
classes but anyway let's move on to the
more<00:01:46.259> in-depth<00:01:46.740> version<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> video<00:01:48.259> okay

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
more in-depth version of the video okay

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
more in-depth version of the video okay
so<00:01:49.320> obviously<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.100> using<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.520> m8a1<00:01:51.000> as

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
so obviously we are using the m8a1 as

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870 
so obviously we are using the m8a1 as
the<00:01:51.750> primary<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> attachment<00:01:53.369> are

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the primary but for the attachment are

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.999 
the primary but for the attachment are
usually<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> burst<00:01:54.930> firing<00:01:55.229> gun<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.619> even<00:01:55.920> an

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
usually on a burst firing gun or even an

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.740 
usually on a burst firing gun or even an
assault<00:01:56.340> rifle<00:01:56.399> I've<00:01:56.790> normally<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.270> ahead<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
assault rifle I've normally go ahead and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
assault rifle I've normally go ahead and
I'd<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:58.079> some<00:01:58.290> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.649> site<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.189> some<00:01:59.399> kind

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
I'd use some kind of site like some kind

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.569 
I'd use some kind of site like some kind
of<00:01:59.640> red<00:01:59.850> dot<00:02:00.090> sight<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> reflex<00:02:01.590> io<00:02:01.829> EO<00:02:02.130> text

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

of red dot sight or a reflex io EO text
cite<00:02:02.700> something<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.140> some

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
cite something like that but for some

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
cite something like that but for some
reason<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> m8a1<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.939> feels<00:02:06.090> like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
reason on the m8a1 it just feels like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
reason on the m8a1 it just feels like
you<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.320> need<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> use<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.099> i

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you don't really need to use it so i

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.830 
you don't really need to use it so i
went<00:02:08.580> ahead<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> i<00:02:09.119> use<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> adjustable

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
went ahead and i use the adjustable

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
went ahead and i use the adjustable
stock<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.349> i<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.560> aim<00:02:10.739> better<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.190> name<00:02:11.400> quicker

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
stock so i can aim better a name quicker

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.040 
stock so i can aim better a name quicker
really<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.629> know

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
really you know

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.840 
really you know
if<00:02:13.140> someone's<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.250> me<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.730> go

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
if someone's to the right of me I can go

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.150 
if someone's to the right of me I can go
ahead<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.720> just<00:02:15.870> pretty<00:02:16.620> much<00:02:16.710> easily

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
ahead and I can just pretty much easily

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.100 
ahead and I can just pretty much easily
move<00:02:17.340> my<00:02:17.580> even<00:02:17.970> easily<00:02:18.300> move<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.630> gun<00:02:18.870> very

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
move my even easily move my gun very

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
move my even easily move my gun very
quickly<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.070> also<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> quick-draw<00:02:20.820> handle

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
quickly and also the quick-draw handle

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.110 
quickly and also the quick-draw handle
the<00:02:22.080> MAA<00:02:22.320> one<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.860> me<00:02:22.980> feels<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> zooms<00:02:23.910> in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
the MAA one to me feels like it zooms in

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.970 
the MAA one to me feels like it zooms in
really<00:02:24.360> quick<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.750> probably<00:02:25.290> really<00:02:25.740> slower

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
really quick it probably really slower

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.530 
really quick it probably really slower
mean<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.430> probably<00:02:26.610> doesn't<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.210> probably

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
mean it probably doesn't it probably

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.570 
mean it probably doesn't it probably
zooms<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.320> exactly<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> same<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.100> most<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.460> us

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
zooms in exactly the same as most of us

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.730 
zooms in exactly the same as most of us
are<00:02:29.850> trifles<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.140> feels<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
are trifles but it just feels like it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.320 
are trifles but it just feels like it
seems<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.100> slower<00:02:32.400> maybe<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.180> an

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
seems in slower maybe because it's an

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.480 
seems in slower maybe because it's an
because<00:02:33.900> its<00:02:34.020> burst<00:02:34.260> firing<00:02:34.500> good<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.010> you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
because its burst firing good and you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.340 
because its burst firing good and you
know<00:02:35.580> maybe<00:02:35.730> I'm<00:02:35.910> firing<00:02:36.210> at<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.630> same<00:02:36.810> time<00:02:37.080> i

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
know maybe I'm firing at the same time i

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.690 
know maybe I'm firing at the same time i
don't<00:02:37.710> i<00:02:37.770> don't<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:38.040> maybe<00:02:38.220> i'm<00:02:38.370> doing<00:02:38.580> too

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
don't i don't know maybe i'm doing too

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.870 
don't i don't know maybe i'm doing too
many<00:02:38.760> things<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.180> once<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.950> just<00:02:41.520> works<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
many things at once but it just works a

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
many things at once but it just works a
lot<00:02:41.970> better<00:02:42.030> for<00:02:42.330> me<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.750> quick-draw

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
lot better for me to use the quick-draw

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.490 
lot better for me to use the quick-draw
handle<00:02:43.560> which<00:02:43.710> is<00:02:43.890> pretty<00:02:44.010> much<00:02:44.190> why<00:02:44.430> i<00:02:44.460> use<00:02:44.880> it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
handle which is pretty much why i use it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
handle which is pretty much why i use it
now<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.560> secondary<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.490> we're<00:02:47.640> using<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
now the secondary that we're using it is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
now the secondary that we're using it is
the<00:02:48.330> cap<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.990> don't<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.620> me<00:02:49.770> using<00:02:49.980> this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the cap for you don't see me using this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580 
the cap for you don't see me using this
gameplay<00:02:50.490> unfortunately<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.230> i'm<00:02:52.320> over

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
gameplay unfortunately but if i'm over

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
gameplay unfortunately but if i'm over
on<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.710> map<00:02:52.950> where<00:02:53.310> I've<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.820> spraying<00:02:54.090> across

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
on a map where I've just spraying across

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.850 
on a map where I've just spraying across
the<00:02:54.540> map<00:02:54.690> pretty<00:02:54.960> much<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.320> close<00:02:55.530> range

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
the map pretty much for a close range

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.740 
the map pretty much for a close range
and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.460> really<00:02:56.700> need<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.940> switch<00:02:57.270> shower<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and I really need to switch shower it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.570 
and I really need to switch shower it's
not<00:02:57.870> very<00:02:57.960> often<00:02:58.200> but<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.130> know<00:02:59.250> having<00:02:59.490> a

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
not very often but you know having a

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.250 
not very often but you know having a
secondary<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.150> very<00:03:00.420> very<00:03:00.600> useful<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.080> that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
secondary is very very useful for that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.560 
secondary is very very useful for that
especially<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.490> kap-40<00:03:03.000> i'm<00:03:03.210> not<00:03:03.330> sure

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
especially and the kap-40 i'm not sure

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.420 
especially and the kap-40 i'm not sure
what<00:03:03.720> level<00:03:03.960> you<00:03:04.080> unlock<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.340> very

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
what level you unlock it but it's very

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.220 
what level you unlock it but it's very
very<00:03:05.640> useful<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.210> because<00:03:06.540> obviously<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
very useful to have because obviously it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.870 
very useful to have because obviously it
is<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.350> fully<00:03:07.590> automatic<00:03:07.890> gun<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.760> can

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
is a fully automatic gun and you can

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.190 
is a fully automatic gun and you can
pretty<00:03:09.060> much<00:03:09.210> use<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.080> a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
pretty much use it as if it's a

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.020 
pretty much use it as if it's a
submachine<00:03:10.680> gun<00:03:10.830> especially<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> kimbos<00:03:11.760> if

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
submachine gun especially as a kimbos if

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.790 
submachine gun especially as a kimbos if
you<00:03:12.360> maybe<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> take<00:03:12.960> off<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.380> light

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
you maybe you want to take off a light

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.350 
you maybe you want to take off a light
and<00:03:13.950> another<00:03:14.310> concussion<00:03:14.670> grenade<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.210> put

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
and another concussion grenade and put

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.730 
and another concussion grenade and put
on<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> Kimbo<00:03:15.900> or<00:03:16.050> cement<00:03:16.290> then<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.530> works

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
on a Kimbo or cement then it works

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.820 
on a Kimbo or cement then it works
really<00:03:17.459> really<00:03:17.640> well<00:03:17.910> now<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.959> perk<00:03:19.200> 1<00:03:19.590> we

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
really really well now for the perk 1 we

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.160 
really really well now for the perk 1 we
do<00:03:20.100> have<00:03:20.310> hard<00:03:20.610> line<00:03:20.910> which<00:03:21.540> i<00:03:21.690> used<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.989> use<00:03:22.020> a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
do have hard line which i used to use a

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.870 
do have hard line which i used to use a
lot<00:03:22.560> at<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> start<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.190> game<00:03:23.250> as<00:03:23.430> show<00:03:23.700> most

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
lot at the start this game as show most

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.210 
lot at the start this game as show most
we<00:03:24.060> knew<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.300> kind<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.320> stops<00:03:25.560> using<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:26.010> bit

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
we knew that kind of stops using a bit

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.680 
we knew that kind of stops using a bit
but<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.580> really<00:03:26.760> useful<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.390> i'm

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
but it's really useful to have i'm

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.170 
but it's really useful to have i'm
pretty<00:03:28.320> sure<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.070> actually<00:03:29.190> reduces<00:03:29.580> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
pretty sure it actually reduces the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.570 
pretty sure it actually reduces the
amount<00:03:30.270> of<00:03:30.620> escort<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> need<00:03:31.860> by<00:03:32.040> twenty

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
amount of escort you need by twenty

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.360 
amount of escort you need by twenty
percent<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.330> if<00:03:33.570> you're<00:03:34.020> going<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.290> get<00:03:34.500> for

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
percent so if you're going to get for

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.229 
percent so if you're going to get for
instance<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:36.000> 100<00:03:37.130> scorestreak<00:03:38.130> then<00:03:38.940> it

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
instance a 100 scorestreak then it

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.910 
instance a 100 scorestreak then it
pretty<00:03:39.750> much<00:03:39.959> allow<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.830> can

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
pretty much allow you so that you can

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.710 
pretty much allow you so that you can
only<00:03:41.010> get<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.280> till<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.239> get<00:03:42.360> up<00:03:42.510> when<00:03:42.630> you

have a t-score speak to it's quite

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.580

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
scavenger it's is pretty much like a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.509 
scavenger it's is pretty much like a
life-saving<00:04:19.530> perk<00:04:19.890> although<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.340> don't

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
life-saving perk although you don't

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.659 
life-saving perk although you don't
think<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.720> if<00:04:22.260> you're<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.680> Alabama<00:04:22.800> your

think is know if you're in Alabama your

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.980 
think is know if you're in Alabama your
dad<00:04:23.850> that's<00:04:24.030> literally<00:04:24.300> how<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.660> really

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
dad that's literally how it is really

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.760 
dad that's literally how it is really
isn't<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.500> scavenge<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.280> my

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
isn't it so scavenge is my

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.129 
isn't it so scavenge is my
her<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.190> after<00:04:27.490> perk<00:04:27.699> 3<00:04:28.150> actually<00:04:29.020> have

extreme<00:04:29.530> condition<00:04:30.009> which<00:04:30.129> is<00:04:30.160> pretty

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
extreme condition which is pretty

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.460 
extreme condition which is pretty
surprising<00:04:31.090> it's<00:04:31.360> not<00:04:31.509> a<00:04:31.539> 7-ton<00:04:31.930> normally<00:04:32.259> use

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470
