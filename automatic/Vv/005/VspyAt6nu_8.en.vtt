all-around stats but he's probably the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.399 
all-around stats but he's probably the
best<00:01:03.390> left-back<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.960> Premier<00:01:04.170> League<00:01:04.199> of

the<00:01:04.470> moment<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> think<00:01:05.159> he'll<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> nod

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the moment so I think he'll get the nod

the moment so I think he'll get the nod
Joe<00:01:06.990> Oh<00:01:07.200> Walker<00:01:08.100> at<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.360> back<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.799> monster

Joe Oh Walker at right back is a monster

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
Joe Oh Walker at right back is a monster
in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> game<00:01:12.030> he'll<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.350> popular<00:01:13.650> if

he's a blue card and I think that does

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
he's a blue card and I think that does
influence<00:01:16.020> eh<00:01:16.439> decisions<00:01:17.100> sometimes<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.820> I

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
Hernandez I think he's gonna score the

Hernandez I think he's gonna score the
most<00:02:21.969> goals<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.510> think<00:02:22.689> he's<00:02:22.780> gonna<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.019> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
most goals I think he's gonna get the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.899 
most goals I think he's gonna get the
golden<00:02:23.379> boot<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> Premier<00:02:23.980> League<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:24.310> I

golden boot in the Premier League and I

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
think he's going to be a big candidate

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.690 
think he's going to be a big candidate
for<00:02:27.189> selection<00:02:28.150> for<00:02:28.299> a<00:02:28.450> blue<00:02:28.599> card<00:02:29.459> will<00:02:30.459> go<00:02:30.579> to

for selection for a blue card will go to

potential<00:02:43.090> blue<00:02:43.299> cards<00:02:43.840> i<00:02:43.989> should<00:02:44.439> say<00:02:44.829> these

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
potential blue cards i should say these

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520 
potential blue cards i should say these
aren't<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.519> official<00:02:45.939> EA<00:02:46.150> blue<00:02:46.569> cards<00:02:46.989> this

aren't the official EA blue cards this
is<00:02:47.709> my<00:02:47.980> interpretation<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.819> what<00:02:49.540> they<00:02:49.569> boom

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
is my interpretation of what they boom

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.300 
is my interpretation of what they boom
of<00:02:50.799> what<00:02:51.250> they<00:02:51.400> may<00:02:51.730> possibly<00:02:52.389> look<00:02:52.720> like<00:02:53.310> here

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
of what they may possibly look like here

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.330 
of what they may possibly look like here
is<00:02:54.519> leighton<00:02:54.879> baines<00:02:55.000> card<00:02:55.540> up<00:02:56.379> his<00:02:56.439> pace<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
is leighton baines card up his pace and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
is leighton baines card up his pace and
what<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.419> think<00:02:59.139> he's<00:02:59.260> possible

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
what have you I think he's possible

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.390 
what have you I think he's possible
price<00:02:59.769> to<00:02:59.889> be<00:02:59.980> 110<00:03:00.459> k<00:03:00.760> when<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.090> settles<00:03:01.329> down

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
price to be 110 k when it settles down

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360 
price to be 110 k when it settles down
obviously<00:03:03.400> would<00:03:04.269> have<00:03:04.439> immense<00:03:05.439> free-kick

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
obviously would have immense free-kick

moving on to Walker it could become one

as<00:05:45.790> well<00:05:45.850> but<00:05:46.720> even<00:05:47.080> so<00:05:47.350> an<00:05:47.560> 87<00:05:48.280> Cazorla<00:05:49.030> is

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
as well but even so an 87 Cazorla is

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.480 
as well but even so an 87 Cazorla is
going<00:05:49.600> to<00:05:49.660> be<00:05:49.750> very<00:05:49.780> tempting<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.680> purchase<00:05:51.250> in

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
going to be very tempting to purchase in

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.460 
going to be very tempting to purchase in
the<00:05:52.120> window<00:05:53.640> Suarez<00:05:54.640> if<00:05:54.850> he<00:05:55.240> gets<00:05:55.450> an<00:05:55.660> increase

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
the window Suarez if he gets an increase

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.680 
the window Suarez if he gets an increase
he<00:05:56.710> could<00:05:56.950> possibly<00:05:57.460> do<00:05:58.000> with<00:05:58.180> a<00:05:58.210> little<00:05:58.450> paste

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
he could possibly do with a little paste

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.570 
he could possibly do with a little paste
increase<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.290> think<00:05:59.500> he<00:05:59.920> looks<00:06:00.130> really<00:06:00.280> quick

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
increase I think he looks really quick

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.610 
increase I think he looks really quick
in<00:06:00.730> real<00:06:00.880> life<00:06:01.060> so<00:06:01.330> I'm<00:06:01.750> not<00:06:01.990> exactly<00:06:02.080> sure<00:06:02.350> why

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
in real life so I'm not exactly sure why

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.460 
in real life so I'm not exactly sure why
his<00:06:02.740> pace<00:06:02.950> is<00:06:03.160> what<00:06:03.310> it<00:06:03.400> is<00:06:03.430> on<00:06:03.820> a<00:06:03.850> limit<00:06:04.120> team

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
his pace is what it is on a limit team

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.800 
his pace is what it is on a limit team
but<00:06:05.470> with<00:06:05.920> an<00:06:06.160> increasing<00:06:06.700> pace<00:06:07.060> he<00:06:07.570> could

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
but with an increasing pace he could

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.710 
but with an increasing pace he could
become<00:06:07.990> like<00:06:08.680> an<00:06:08.920> amazing<00:06:09.670> strut<00:06:09.910> an<00:06:10.030> 89<00:06:10.540> rate

real life but if he gets a blue card he

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.370 
real life but if he gets a blue card he
might<00:06:29.590> be<00:06:30.010> scary<00:06:30.970> fast<00:06:31.390> as<00:06:31.630> a<00:06:31.660> blue<00:06:31.870> card<00:06:32.140> and
