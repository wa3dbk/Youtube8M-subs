00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello everyone I'm super drop 4.810 and today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.980
 I come with my first video loquendo before 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.410
 to start I want to send my 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.170
 thanks to all my subscribers 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.580
 to follow each of my battles 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.650
 hypothetical of dragon ball zy for 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.300
 have any questions about me 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.490
 next great battle that I've been 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 announcing I mean benito versus 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.769
 bills can do me in the fede my 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.109
 good youtube channel so let me 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 we will proceed with the subject of the video the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.340
 which on this occasion has nothing to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 see with dragon ball z but it's about 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 about the horror comic called marvel 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 zombies as you know this story is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 a bizarre version of the marvel universe 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 in which all marvel heroes like 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 the avengers spiderman and so on have 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.700
 been converted by a virus 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.649
 interdimensional in carnivores zombies 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 no soul that only live to devour 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.809
 innocent people without mercy the truth 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.789
 after reading it a couple of times I've 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 discovered that there are certain errors in 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 the comic because here many heroes 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.059
 they could easily avoid the infection 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.189
 or simply be immune to it and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.180
 even be able to do away with all 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.640
 the infected without problems 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 as for example the most famous of many 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.560
 and my favorite the ghost biker ' 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.140
 as everyone already knows the biker 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.730
 ghost 'is a hellish spirit whose 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.280
 power is almost unlimited 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.410
 very similar or similar to a god the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.350
 which is even able to beat the hull 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.510
 destroyer of worlds easily this is 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.760
 mentioned by the same strange doctor 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.130
 It is also very clear that the rider 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.260
 ghost 'could not infect him since 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.000
 It is pure burning skeleton and also 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.670
 those who dare to try 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.530
 touching it will be incinerated instantly if 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 whoever tried it had their hands 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.450
 stained with innocent blood and in addition 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.160
 with his penitent gaze he is capable of 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 burn the soul of those who have 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 spilled innocent blood is more than 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.160
 clear that with these skills neither 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.440
 even if he was attacked by all the heroes 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.570
 zombies including those who took the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.460
 star power galactus none 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.770
 I would have an opportunity before the biker 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.630
 ghost 'since although it was for his 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.670
 endless hunger or whatever the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.979
 marvel zombies would have the blood of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.590
 millions of innocents in their hands better 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.570
 said of all humanity and before this 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.080
 fact they would be defenseless before the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.900
 biker 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.640
 ghost whose central mission is to destroy 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.710
 and punish all those who are 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.260
 dare to kill innocent people be 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.660
 whatever the reason and if some think 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.520
 that the ghost biker 'if it could be 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.350
 infected by zombie heroes if you 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.300
 they did through their human part 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.010
 they should know that this could not 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.350
 happen because the spirit 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 hell would not allow it or just 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.860
 he would stay as a ghost biker ' 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.620
 to finish with all marvel 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.420
 zombies in addition there are also other 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.280
 heroes that should not have been infected 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.620
 due to his abilities as per 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.330
 example we also have a cheetah whose 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.520
 healing factor protects it from any 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470
 type of virus and it can also 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.330
 kill a good number of zombie heroes 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.340
 because of that healing ability that 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.740
 heals instantly from any wound and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.260
 for while I would continue fighting too 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.240
 we have the incredible hulk who also 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.160
 It has a healing factor although more 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.320
 accelerated than the cheetah and with his 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.000
 strength increase you and devastating anger 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.100
 He could also have finished with the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 marvel zombies in a matter of days 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.780
 and so we could continue to name many 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.030
 others but not to stretch so much 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.190
 I'll finish the video explaining why 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.560
 of the end of marvel zombies the return 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.750
 as they saw at the end the watchman sends 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.910
 to zombie e always back to the world 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.710
 initial of the story or at the beginning 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.930
 of the glow and the murmur in 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.790
 clouds that started all this he did for 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.320
 shut up the terrible infection in a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.570
 eternal limb in which the infection 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.700
 would be trapped living their own 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.800
 story again and again in a few 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.720
 words all this in the end was no more 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.180
 that a paradox that would never end 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.370
 because he never really started but that 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 it will continue eternally devouring itself 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.960
 same and good that was all hopefully 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.540
 I liked my first video loquendo 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.610
 any question in the comments 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.830
 very soon new hypothetical battles 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.340
 take care everyone I say goodbye to the 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 next
