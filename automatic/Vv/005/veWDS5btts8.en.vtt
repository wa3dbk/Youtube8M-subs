review of the graphics cards themselves
to<00:02:28.239> see<00:02:28.930> how<00:02:29.050> we<00:02:29.110> do<00:02:29.290> temperature<00:02:29.680> wise

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
to see how we do temperature wise

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.910 
to see how we do temperature wise
compared<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.550> other<00:02:30.670> cards<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.209> yeah<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.920> so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
compared to other cards but yeah and so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.790

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.200 
and did relatively look in my opinion
look<00:04:25.650> rather<00:04:25.920> stylish<00:04:26.610> they<00:04:26.850> were<00:04:26.970> good

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
look rather stylish they were good

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.800 
look rather stylish they were good
quality<00:04:27.450> they<00:04:27.810> feel<00:04:28.140> very<00:04:28.380> good<00:04:28.680> quality<00:04:28.890> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
quality they feel very good quality and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.110 
quality they feel very good quality and
now<00:04:30.810> obviously<00:04:31.230> we<00:04:31.440> have<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.950> 780<00:04:32.460> here<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
now obviously we have the 780 here and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.380 
now obviously we have the 780 here and
we<00:04:33.210> have<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.480> 780<00:04:33.930> Ti<00:04:34.080> here<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.240> give

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
we have the 780 Ti here and just to give

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.110 
we have the 780 Ti here and just to give
you<00:04:36.420> an<00:04:36.570> indication<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:37.080> performance<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:38.120> would

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
you an indication of performance I would

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.330 
you an indication of performance I would
say<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.510> Ti<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.810> roughly<00:04:40.410> about<00:04:40.500> five<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.160> ten

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
say the Ti is roughly about five to ten

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.140 
say the Ti is roughly about five to ten
percent<00:04:41.430> faster<00:04:42.140> in<00:04:43.310> synthetic<00:04:44.310> benchmarks

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
percent faster in synthetic benchmarks

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.790 
percent faster in synthetic benchmarks
and<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:46.650> every<00:04:47.580> day<00:04:47.730> gaming<00:04:48.470> there's<00:04:49.470> not<00:04:49.620> much

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
and in every day gaming there's not much

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.530 
and in every day gaming there's not much
difference<00:04:50.010> between<00:04:50.280> them<00:04:50.790> now<00:04:51.390> obviously

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
difference between them now obviously

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.940 
difference between them now obviously
the<00:04:52.790> 780<00:04:53.790> Ti<00:04:53.910> is<00:04:54.710> 575<00:04:55.710> pound<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:57.380> 780<00:04:58.380> honest

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
the 780 Ti is 575 pound the 780 honest

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.760 
the 780 Ti is 575 pound the 780 honest
is<00:04:59.160> 400<00:04:59.910> pounds<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.330> there's<00:05:00.480> a<00:05:00.540> 175<00:05:01.410> pound

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
is 400 pounds so there's a 175 pound

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.340 
is 400 pounds so there's a 175 pound
price<00:05:02.070> difference<00:05:02.490> between<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.850> two<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.120> them

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
price difference between the two of them

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.710 
price difference between the two of them
do<00:05:04.350> Iraq<00:05:04.800> do<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.100> really<00:05:05.640> recommend<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.360> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
do Iraq do I really recommend that the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.250 
do Iraq do I really recommend that the
that<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.710> 780<00:05:08.220> Ti<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:09.090> worth<00:05:09.300> more<00:05:09.510> than<00:05:09.570> a<00:05:09.780> 780

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
that the 780 Ti is worth more than a 780

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.720 
that the 780 Ti is worth more than a 780
guess<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:11.640> it's<00:05:11.760> not<00:05:11.910> 175<00:05:12.810> pound<00:05:13.080> mark<00:05:16.220> on<00:05:17.220> the

these<00:05:50.880> cards<00:05:51.390> were<00:05:51.510> for<00:05:51.840> gigabit<00:05:52.320> gigabyte<00:05:53.130> of

these cards were for gigabit gigabyte of

these cards were for gigabit gigabyte of
memory<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.790> like<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> 2<00:05:54.420> 5<00:05:54.660> 6<00:05:54.870> boss<00:05:55.400> slightly

bandwidth<00:05:56.820> cap<00:05:57.120> compared<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.840> say<00:05:58.110> before

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.770

like<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:59.040> 512<00:05:59.850> bosses<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.480> free<00:06:00.660> at

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
like the 512 bosses and the free at

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.680 
like the 512 bosses and the free at
fullest<00:06:01.050> but<00:06:01.550> generally<00:06:02.550> why<00:06:02.670> I<00:06:02.700> find<00:06:03.150> is<00:06:03.420> it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
fullest but generally why I find is it

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.090 
fullest but generally why I find is it
doesn't<00:06:03.960> really<00:06:04.110> make<00:06:04.320> much<00:06:04.530> difference<00:06:04.560> in

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
doesn't really make much difference in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.810 
doesn't really make much difference in
gaming<00:06:05.490> but<00:06:05.970> yeah<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.740> now<00:06:07.740> let's<00:06:08.610> have<00:06:08.730> a

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
gaming but yeah and now let's have a

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.800 
gaming but yeah and now let's have a
look<00:06:08.940> what<00:06:09.120> I<00:06:09.150> think<00:06:10.910> now<00:06:11.910> as<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.090> mentioned<00:06:12.720> the

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.350 
now looking at the two cards itself as
I've<00:06:25.320> mentioned<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.830> both<00:06:26.130> identical<00:06:26.670> and
