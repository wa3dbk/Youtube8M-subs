00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so you play it on the the 4th fret this

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.850 
so you play it on the the 4th fret this
bar<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.030> slide<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.789 

okay<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.509> that's<00:01:56.600> kind<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.020> bit<00:01:57.140> slower<00:01:57.499> so

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
okay so that's kind of a bit slower so

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.590 
okay so that's kind of a bit slower so

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
along two sets of frets okay so you end

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.369 
along two sets of frets okay so you end
up<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.989> kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:19.239> sound<00:02:20.239> there<00:02:20.660> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
we're kind of beginners here all I'm

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.250 
we're kind of beginners here all I'm
doing<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.260> I'm<00:02:27.860> holding<00:02:28.400> down<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:30.200> string

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
doing is I'm holding down the string

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.300 
doing is I'm holding down the string
just<00:02:30.739> moving<00:02:31.099> on<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:32.000> sixth<00:02:32.989> fret<00:02:33.049> barred<00:02:33.410> and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
just moving on the sixth fret barred and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.819 
just moving on the sixth fret barred and
then<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.390> fourth<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.260> fifth<00:02:36.440> on<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.650> eighth

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
then the fourth and fifth on the eighth

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.850 
then the fourth and fifth on the eighth
fret<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.549> I'm<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.569> kind<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.780> taking<00:02:39.530> them

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
fret and I'm just kind of taking them

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.589 
fret and I'm just kind of taking them
off<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.220> strings<00:02:40.579> now<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.269> see<00:02:41.450> that

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
off the strings now if you can see that

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.089 
off the strings now if you can see that
on<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.780> camera<00:02:41.810> they're<00:02:42.230> just<00:02:42.709> taken<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.010> so

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
on the camera they're just taken off so

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.979 
on the camera they're just taken off so
they're<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.400> resting<00:02:43.970> on<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> strings<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
they're just resting on the strings it

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.280 
they're just resting on the strings it
makes<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.319> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.099> new<00:02:47.060> T<00:02:47.239> sound<00:02:47.599> okay

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
makes that kind of the new T sound okay

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.920 
makes that kind of the new T sound okay
so<00:02:48.349> what<00:02:48.620> we're<00:02:48.769> getting<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.780> normal<00:02:50.780> strung

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
so what we're getting is normal strung

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.160 
so what we're getting is normal strung
move<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.170> another<00:02:54.709> normal<00:02:55.160> strum<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.269> then

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
move up another normal strum and then

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.800 
move up another normal strum and then
fingers<00:02:57.709> off<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:59.090> make<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.359> you<00:02:59.540> can<00:02:59.720> always
