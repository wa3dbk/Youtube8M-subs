00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
really not enough with our with our

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.709 
really not enough with our with our
damage<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> low<00:00:38.969> resilience<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> not

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
damage in the low resilience it's not

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.530 
damage in the low resilience it's not
enough<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.829> priest<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> popping<00:00:42.210> cooldowns

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
enough our priest is popping cooldowns

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.910 
enough our priest is popping cooldowns
we<00:00:42.629> told<00:00:42.780> him<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.230> getting<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> kill<00:00:43.770> right

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
we told him we're getting a kill right

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.369 
we told him we're getting a kill right
here<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.940> he<00:00:45.360> knew<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.870> happening<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
here so he knew what was happening I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
here so he knew what was happening I
would<00:00:46.950> choose<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> DK<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.640> our<00:00:47.760> kill<00:00:47.910> target

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
would choose the DK as our kill target

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.459 
would choose the DK as our kill target
because<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> warrior<00:00:48.840> does<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> shield

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
because the warrior does have a shield

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
because the warrior does have a shield
and<00:00:49.620> he<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.550> shield<00:00:50.789> wall<00:00:51.030> shield<00:00:51.420> block

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and he can shield wall shield block

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
and he can shield wall shield block
disarm<00:00:51.960> tank<00:00:52.199> us<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.730> that's<00:00:53.730> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
disarm tank us and that's kind of a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
disarm tank us and that's kind of a
bitch<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> deal<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.050> days<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:59.059> yeah

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
bitch to deal with some days so yeah

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
bitch to deal with some days so yeah
it's<00:01:00.329> pretty<00:01:00.780> simple<00:01:01.079> once<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it's pretty simple once you get the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's pretty simple once you get the
first<00:01:01.829> kill<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:02.609> matches<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
first kill on all of these matches and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.640 
first kill on all of these matches and
its<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.750> erased<00:01:04.080> for<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> first<00:01:04.470> kill

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
its really erased for the first kill

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.200 
its really erased for the first kill
most<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.010> time<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.960> PhD

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
most of the time this is going to be PhD

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.940 
most of the time this is going to be PhD
priest<00:01:09.210> hunter<00:01:09.420> death<00:01:09.810> knight<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.799> make

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
priest hunter death knight I they make

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520 
priest hunter death knight I they make
one<00:01:11.220> mistake<00:01:11.369> um<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.750> two<00:01:13.080> mistakes<00:01:13.350> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
one mistake um I think two mistakes this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.840 
one mistake um I think two mistakes this
definitely<00:01:13.860> might<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.130> blood<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:15.350> accident

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
definitely might be blood on accident

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.490 
definitely might be blood on accident
but<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> hunter<00:01:18.360> makes<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.020> mistake<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
but the hunter makes one mistake and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
but the hunter makes one mistake and
that<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.890> makes<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.150> win<00:01:21.360> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that really makes it so we win this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
that really makes it so we win this
should<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.380> gone<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.590> for<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.130> don't

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
should have gone on for another I don't

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
should have gone on for another I don't
know<00:01:24.000> 30<00:01:24.240> seconds<00:01:24.659> before<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.990> reset<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
know 30 seconds before we reset the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
know 30 seconds before we reset the
deterrence<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.040> healed<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.520> we'd

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
deterrence and he got healed up and we'd

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.359 
deterrence and he got healed up and we'd
had<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> reset<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> first<00:01:27.530> but<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> death

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
had to reset the first but the death

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.590 
had to reset the first but the death
knight<00:01:29.579> wasn't<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:30.030> enough<00:01:30.090> damage<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
knight wasn't doing enough damage to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.179 
knight wasn't doing enough damage to
make<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> worthwhile<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:31.770> starting<00:01:32.040> on

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
make it worthwhile so we're starting on

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.240 
make it worthwhile so we're starting on
the<00:01:32.430> hunter<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.320> we're<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.409> forces

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the hunter and we're gonna forces

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
the hunter and we're gonna forces
deterrence<00:01:35.610> pretty<00:01:35.790> quickly<00:01:36.079> right<00:01:37.079> there<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
deterrence pretty quickly right there I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.060 
deterrence pretty quickly right there I
think<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.210> he<00:01:39.210> disengages<00:01:39.659> off<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> cliff<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
think and he disengages off the cliff so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
think and he disengages off the cliff so
he<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.520> ranged<00:01:41.820> his<00:01:41.939> healer<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:43.140> popped

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
he just ranged his healer and I popped

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.100 
he just ranged his healer and I popped
wreck<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> went<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.520> decide<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> kill<00:01:45.000> him<00:01:45.110> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
wreck and went and decide to kill him so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.420 
wreck and went and decide to kill him so
that's<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.770> our<00:01:46.920> first<00:01:47.009> kill<00:01:47.250> pretty

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that's how we got our first kill pretty

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
that's how we got our first kill pretty
easily<00:01:47.579> our<00:01:48.420> shamans<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.930> there<00:01:49.049> raining

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
easily our shamans up there raining

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.990 
easily our shamans up there raining
death<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.369> guess<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.000> picked<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
death down I guess we just picked the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.420 
death down I guess we just picked the
Paladin<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.210> our<00:01:54.930> kill<00:01:55.079> target<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
Paladin as our kill target from here it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.679 
Paladin as our kill target from here it
doesn't<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.790> matter<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.299> everyone's

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
doesn't really matter once everyone's

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.550 
doesn't really matter once everyone's
dead<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.020> i'm<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> show<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
dead but i'm going to show this to the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
dead but i'm going to show this to the
bubble<00:01:58.860> because<00:01:59.009> death<00:01:59.820> knight<00:02:00.000> paladin<00:02:00.420> can

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bubble because death knight paladin can

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
bubble because death knight paladin can
to<00:02:00.930> v3<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.189> warrior<00:02:02.520> pallet<00:02:02.820> inner

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
to v3 just like warrior pallet inner

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.569 
to v3 just like warrior pallet inner
warrior<00:02:03.210> druid<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> v3<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.189> he<00:02:05.280> bubbled

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
warrior druid can to v3 so he bubbled

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
warrior druid can to v3 so he bubbled
and<00:02:05.700> we're<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> next<00:02:06.689> match<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.530> one

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and we're on to the next match this one

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
and we're on to the next match this one
is<00:02:07.890> against<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:08.340> arcane<00:02:08.729> mage<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.209> a

is against an arcane mage and a
demonology<00:02:10.020> warlock<00:02:10.190> it<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.340> take<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> second

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
demonology warlock it does take a second

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.280 
demonology warlock it does take a second
for<00:02:11.879> us<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.180> set<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.750> glad

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
this isn't displaying the specs so we

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.119 
this isn't displaying the specs so we
weren't<00:02:15.569> quite<00:02:15.840> sure<00:02:15.959> what's<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.439> on<00:02:16.560> I'm

not entirely sure how to fight
demonology<00:02:18.900> warlock<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:21.090> still

demonology warlock right now it's still

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.149 
demonology warlock right now it's still
just<00:02:21.510> getting<00:02:21.930> used<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.349> new<00:02:22.469> changes<00:02:22.799> and

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
just getting used to the new changes and

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.449 
just getting used to the new changes and
demonology<00:02:23.579> really<00:02:24.209> wasn't<00:02:24.540> viable<00:02:25.459> for

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
demonology really wasn't viable for

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.250 
demonology really wasn't viable for
anything<00:02:26.640> before<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:28.140> pvp<00:02:28.439> concept<00:02:30.260> so

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
anything before in that pvp concept so

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.059 
anything before in that pvp concept so
we<00:02:31.379> do<00:02:31.470> pick<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.709> arcane<00:02:32.340> mages<00:02:32.519> our<00:02:32.670> target<00:02:33.000> I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.470 
need to cut this out but I'm probably
not<00:02:40.590> going<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.819> that<00:02:42.030> takes<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.359> much

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
not going to because that takes too much
