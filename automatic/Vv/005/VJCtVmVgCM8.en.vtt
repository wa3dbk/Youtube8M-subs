00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.340
 just a short word about the cases 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.370
 So they were fresh 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.650
 we have all the excitement elke old 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.470
 cemetery there you really get 18 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.240
 I did that with so many 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.200
 swear on types of years and laurels 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 and and juniper and hats did not see 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.559
 This trout farm also has a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 restaurant that has been around since 35 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.699
 years with us and I always think why 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.949
 reinvent the wheel 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:46.040
 they are laying their freshly caught 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:48.900
 trout in salzlake 1 10% saline 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.030
 come in there for twelve hours 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.399
 you just have to pay attention to it all the higher 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.920
 the concentration of the salzlake all the more 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.880
 less marinated time should the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.070
 actually have 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.230
 That means if you're there after twelve hours 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.340
 no time has the rausholen the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.379
 wash thoroughly 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.670
 then just five percent or less 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.509
 what can you do that longer in the water 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 let lie 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.250
 that has already happened i have 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 the rinsed out now you should on it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.399
 eighth when held open after 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 and that they are a bit dry so the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.310
 Skin should be already dried the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.709
 should not shine so much 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.100
 furthermore, foil potatoes nothing 

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:27.660
 so special taste is yes 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.429
 unlike i do it before 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.789
 Brush a little with olive oil from 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.690
 outside and once salted and peppered 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.039
 I do not know my imagination 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.550
 probably only one but I think 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.990
 they have a slightly spicy touch 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.530
 but that remains for everyone 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.940
 leave 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 That's why I advise the great here 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.039
 about spices or think about which 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.090
 Sossenheim's taste is always 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.330
 differently 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.030
 furthermore importantly very important 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.289
 will be later after so hung up 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.640
 that they stand upright 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.750
 I have I was in the goal I was there 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.910
 olive oil has made it from the weather 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 plastered out beforehand otherwise this sticks 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.350
 everything about the skin flap and the wool 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 of course avoid because we want the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 do not trout any more 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.590
 already touch the potato in the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.209
 lateral firebox I always can 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 open in between and the potato 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.720
 even so they do not turn black 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 and so not on one 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.940
 minute I put them too 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.110
 rust is the best experience for me 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.550
 it does not matter if you look 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.739
 forgot to turn 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.940
 the things are not the same and black 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.440
 then Switzerland me the same times on the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.330
 grill and keep looking 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.360
 Then I wanted to give you the practice 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.910
 show the model right now 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.430
 actually opened the 80th 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.540
 Degree 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.340
 the four are in the meantime 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.990
 taken there one of the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780
 Outsider was not so in the beginning 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.640
 popular as I said only in salzlake 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.830
 inserted and here we are here 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.410
 The potatoes already in there beech wood 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.190
 Brent gives me the 80 degrees later 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.660
 that fits that I can if and 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.930
 turn as I want without even 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.450
 chamber to touch the trout stay 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
 completely untouched and I have to give 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.960
 Process not by constantly on and 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.390
 it can be very good here 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.390
 to regulate the heat knows now too 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.370
 I is exhaust pipe I 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.440
 completely open here is the other side 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.330
 I will close later 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.010
 so I have a bit more smoke 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.920
 But first I want this process 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.390
 as I said the potatoes are 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.130
 on this the whole thing will be complete 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.170
 closed , I would refill immediately 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 of course, this opens completely 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.989
 flap and sweat off the bottom 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.390
 then I do not need to the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.890
 Potato says so and if that like that 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.640
 you are ready to see it again 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.750
 on the plate 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.790
 see you soon 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.690
 so we have phase and smoke phase 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.890
 Meanwhile, the golden brown are reached 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.670
 they may see again as 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.670
 photo on the plate and he also sees 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.130
 that the potato is under the smoke 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.580
 but have suffered only the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.120
 alufoil so everything is buttery soft and now 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.120
 you can eat
