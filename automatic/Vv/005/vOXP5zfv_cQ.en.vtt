improve<00:02:44.069> upon<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.579> well<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.389> think<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:45.840> my

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
improve upon you well I think here my

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.839 
improve upon you well I think here my
planning<00:02:46.500> helps<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.889> improving<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.609> many

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
planning helps you to improving in many

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.569 
planning helps you to improving in many
areas<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.569> in<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.170> preparation<00:02:49.470> here<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.220> much

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
areas so in the preparation here is much

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.970 
areas so in the preparation here is much
more<00:02:50.760> intense<00:02:51.139> than<00:02:52.139> what<00:02:52.379> I<00:02:52.409> was<00:02:52.620> used<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
more intense than what I was used so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.819 
more intense than what I was used so
this<00:02:53.870> automatically<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.230> work<00:02:55.409> will

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
this automatically with the work will

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.250 
this automatically with the work will
improve<00:02:56.159> and<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.609> think<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.900> once<00:02:58.109> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
improve and I think I think once the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.159 
improve and I think I think once the
season<00:02:58.620> starts<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:59.069> will<00:02:59.250> all<00:02:59.579> start<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.060> look

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
season starts we will all start to look

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.679 
season starts we will all start to look
we're<00:03:01.169> worried<00:03:01.379> what<00:03:01.889> we<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.189> to<00:03:02.340> improve

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
we're worried what we have to improve

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.300 
we're worried what we have to improve
qualifying<00:03:03.689> maybe<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.260> something<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:05.099> I

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
qualifying maybe it's something that I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
qualifying maybe it's something that I
don't<00:03:05.519> know<00:03:05.639> hope<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.840> what<00:03:07.019> Lewis

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
don't know hope that that what Lewis

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.899 
don't know hope that that what Lewis
Hamilton<00:03:07.680> was<00:03:07.799> able<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.099> do<00:03:08.220> here<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.730> maybe

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
Hamilton was able to do here that maybe

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.309 
Hamilton was able to do here that maybe
you'll<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.329> able<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.629> do<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.780> mean<00:03:10.049> do<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.290> feel

the season well F&amp;E is a target he is
difficult<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.349> set<00:03:16.859> us<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.280> target<00:03:17.819> from<00:03:18.599> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
difficult to set us a target from the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.180 
difficult to set us a target from the
start<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.079> decision<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.709> tell<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.159> I

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.710 
will be in pole in Melbourne will be
very<00:03:23.280> difficult<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.760> me<00:03:23.879> to<00:03:24.090> know<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> think

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
very difficult for me to know I think

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.839 
very difficult for me to know I think
first<00:03:25.409> of<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:25.949> have<00:03:25.979> to<00:03:26.310> go<00:03:26.340> through

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
first of all we have to go through

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.059 
first of all we have to go through
testing<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.599> try<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.870> do<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.500> maximum<00:03:28.919> we<00:03:29.040> can

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
testing to try to do the maximum we can

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.270 
testing to try to do the maximum we can
change<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.269> must<00:03:30.479> have<00:03:30.659> to<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:31.979> a<00:03:32.010> very

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
change and I must have to to have a very

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.280 
change and I must have to to have a very
competitive<00:03:32.579> car<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.359> then<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:34.079> we<00:03:34.139> can

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
competitive car and then I think we can

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.469 
competitive car and then I think we can
do<00:03:34.409> a<00:03:34.440> very<00:03:34.709> good<00:03:34.739> job<00:03:34.859> in<00:03:35.129> my<00:03:35.250> woman<00:03:35.609> towards<00:03:36.359> a

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
do a very good job in my woman towards a

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.509 
do a very good job in my woman towards a
very<00:03:37.019> long<00:03:37.229> season<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.799> had<00:03:37.979> ahead<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.370> us

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
very long season that we had ahead of us

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.670 
very long season that we had ahead of us
just<00:03:39.239> early<00:03:39.569> days<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.810> know<00:03:40.229> it's<00:03:40.440> hard<00:03:40.560> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
just early days I know it's hard to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.129 
just early days I know it's hard to
predict<00:03:41.099> what<00:03:41.129> will<00:03:41.400> happen<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.569> terms<00:03:42.959> of

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
predict what will happen but in terms of

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.339 
predict what will happen but in terms of
2013<00:03:43.919> who<00:03:44.459> are<00:03:44.609> McLaren's<00:03:45.150> chief<00:03:45.780> rivals<00:03:46.229> do

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
2013 who are McLaren's chief rivals do

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.839 
2013 who are McLaren's chief rivals do
you<00:03:46.409> think<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.799> championship<00:03:47.159> well<00:03:47.760> I

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
you think for the championship well I

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.750 
you think for the championship well I
think<00:03:47.909> at<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.599> moment<00:03:48.629> it<00:03:49.349> looks<00:03:49.709> like<00:03:49.979> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
think at the moment it looks like the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.839 
think at the moment it looks like the
top<00:03:50.970> teams<00:03:51.180> will<00:03:51.870> be<00:03:51.989> very<00:03:52.199> very<00:03:52.609> much<00:03:53.609> at<00:03:53.819> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
top teams will be very very much at the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.240 
top teams will be very very much at the
top<00:03:54.120> law<00:03:54.329> with<00:03:54.629> Red<00:03:54.840> Bull<00:03:55.489> ferrari<00:03:57.590> mercedes<00:03:58.590> i

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
top law with Red Bull ferrari mercedes i

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.909 
top law with Red Bull ferrari mercedes i
think<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.419> will<00:04:00.599> be<00:04:00.750> even<00:04:01.079> low<00:04:01.319> today<00:04:01.530> will<00:04:01.799> be

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
think it will be even low today will be

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.129 
think it will be even low today will be
very<00:04:01.949> strong<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.519> who<00:04:03.449> knows<00:04:03.599> we<00:04:03.810> can<00:04:03.989> have

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
very strong and who knows we can have

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.110 
very strong and who knows we can have
any<00:04:04.620> surprise<00:04:05.099> in<00:04:05.250> Formula<00:04:05.549> One<00:04:05.699> everything

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
change so quickly that is difficult to

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.490 
change so quickly that is difficult to
