00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
I'm here with Nick Maxwell from hobbico

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.579 
I'm here with Nick Maxwell from hobbico
and<00:00:11.610> he's<00:00:12.089> holding<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.959> of<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> nicest

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:13.589 
and he's holding one of the nicest

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.079 
and he's holding one of the nicest
little<00:00:13.709> helicopters<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:14.519> seen<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> long

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
little helicopters I've seen in a long

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.580 
little helicopters I've seen in a long
time<00:00:15.360> Nick<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.200> you<00:00:16.260> tell<00:00:16.379> me<00:00:16.439> about

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
time Nick what can you tell me about

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.339 
time Nick what can you tell me about
this<00:00:16.800> one<00:00:17.039> well<00:00:17.939> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.269> the<00:00:18.449> new<00:00:18.630> mini<00:00:18.960> Titan

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
this one well this is the new mini Titan

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.609 
this one well this is the new mini Titan
version<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:20.519> had<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> successful<00:00:21.570> 325<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
version they had the successful 325 and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
version they had the successful 325 and
with<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> demand<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> new<00:00:24.060> flight

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
with the demand of the new flight

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
with the demand of the new flight
performance<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.170> things<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.880> they've

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
performance and things like that they've

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
performance and things like that they've
stretched<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> blades<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> 350<00:00:28.619> millimeters

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
stretched the blades to 350 millimeters

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.579 
stretched the blades to 350 millimeters
and<00:00:29.669> stretch<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> boom<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.570> allow<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
and stretch the boom to allow for that

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.670 
and stretch the boom to allow for that
it's<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:32.040> torque<00:00:32.280> drive<00:00:32.490> system<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.680> basically

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
it's a torque drive system and basically

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.800 
it's a torque drive system and basically
it's<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.400> same<00:00:35.730> proven<00:00:36.150> design<00:00:36.420> but<00:00:36.660> it's

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
it's the same proven design but it's

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.040 
it's the same proven design but it's
newer<00:00:37.110> bigger<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.740> better

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
newer bigger and better

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.710 
newer bigger and better
22:21<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.250> 4400<00:00:41.970> kV<00:00:42.180> motor<00:00:42.480> for

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
22:21 like you know 4400 kV motor for

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.880 
22:21 like you know 4400 kV motor for
three<00:00:42.900> cells<00:00:45.380> basically<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.470> same<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.770> your

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
three cells basically the same as your

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
three cells basically the same as your
average<00:00:47.040> 450<00:00:47.670> micro<00:00:48.090> servos<00:00:48.510> flybarless<00:00:49.110> unit

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
average 450 micro servos flybarless unit

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.050 
average 450 micro servos flybarless unit
everything<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.580> just<00:00:50.760> go<00:00:50.880> from

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
everything like that can just go from

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.820 
everything like that can just go from
any<00:00:51.240> flybarless<00:00:51.690> 450<00:00:52.380> that<00:00:52.530> you've<00:00:52.680> got<00:00:52.800> out

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
any flybarless 450 that you've got out

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.310 
any flybarless 450 that you've got out
there<00:00:53.360> the<00:00:54.360> tail<00:00:54.540> rotor<00:00:54.720> is<00:00:54.870> mounted<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.290> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there the tail rotor is mounted on the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
there the tail rotor is mounted on the
boom<00:00:55.560> so<00:00:55.950> that<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.370> easy<00:00:56.490> access<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
boom so that way it's easy access you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.340 
boom so that way it's easy access you
can<00:00:57.150> or<00:00:57.300> even<00:00:57.450> run<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.630> full-size<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
can or even run a full-size if you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.910 
can or even run a full-size if you
wanted<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> Micro<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.730> full-size<00:01:00.710> this<00:01:01.710> one's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
wanted to Micro or full-size this one's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
wanted to Micro or full-size this one's
