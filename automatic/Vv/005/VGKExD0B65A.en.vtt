00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
idea came to me when I was playing with

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
idea came to me when I was playing with
two<00:01:25.380> people<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.350> FFA<00:01:28.350> gunplay<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> there

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
two people in like FFA gunplay and there
was<00:01:29.249> like<00:01:29.429> some<00:01:29.609> really<00:01:29.880> really<00:01:30.149> stopping

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
was like some really really stopping

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.599 
was like some really really stopping
people<00:01:30.719> in<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.109> and<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.319> were<00:01:31.409> getting

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
people in there and they were getting

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:34.730
