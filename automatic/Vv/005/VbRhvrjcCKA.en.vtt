air as his overlords are hunted and

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.309 
air as his overlords are hunted and
destroyed<00:00:02.100> in<00:00:02.730> the<00:00:02.909> sky<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.419> here<00:00:03.870> comes<00:00:04.110> the

destroyed in the sky and here comes the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.590 
destroyed in the sky and here comes the
Protoss<00:00:04.680> pushing<00:00:05.460> against<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> zerg<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.420> see

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
Protoss pushing against the zerg to see

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.240 
Protoss pushing against the zerg to see
a<00:00:06.629> ton<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.930> stalkers<00:00:07.350> moving<00:00:07.649> up<00:00:07.770> into<00:00:07.980> now

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
a ton of stalkers moving up into now

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.580 
a ton of stalkers moving up into now
Yunho<00:00:08.880> leaves<00:00:09.240> expansion<00:00:09.840> but<00:00:10.019> there<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.380> too

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Yunho leaves expansion but there are too

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.530 
Yunho leaves expansion but there are too
many<00:00:10.740> zerglings<00:00:11.280> those<00:00:11.460> stalkers<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:12.059> not

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
many zerglings those stalkers are not

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.209 
many zerglings those stalkers are not
strong<00:00:12.840> enough<00:00:12.870> against<00:00:13.590> enough<00:00:13.799> units<00:00:14.070> that

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
strong enough against enough units that

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.680 
strong enough against enough units that
can<00:00:14.309> surround<00:00:14.670> them<00:00:14.880> they<00:00:14.969> only<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.330> blink

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
can surround them they only have blink

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.720 
can surround them they only have blink
and<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> 10<00:00:16.740> second<00:00:17.130> cooldown<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and that's on a 10 second cooldown so

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.710 
and that's on a 10 second cooldown so
those<00:00:17.880> things<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.150> gonna<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.390> surrounded

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
those things are gonna get surrounded

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.420 
those things are gonna get surrounded
again<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> zerglings<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.130> fast

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
again because the zerglings are so fast

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
again because the zerglings are so fast
and<00:00:20.670> David<00:00:21.359> Kim's<00:00:21.570> assault<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> thwarted<00:00:22.680> yeah

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
and David Kim's assault is thwarted yeah

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.470 
and David Kim's assault is thwarted yeah
you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.580> how<00:00:23.670> badly<00:00:23.939> those<00:00:24.210> units

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you can see just how badly those units

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300 
you can see just how badly those units
were<00:00:24.570> damaged<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> previous<00:00:25.590> attack<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
were damaged in the previous attack the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.620 
were damaged in the previous attack the
stalkers<00:00:26.730> were<00:00:26.760> quickly<00:00:27.150> surrounded<00:00:27.510> they

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
stalkers were quickly surrounded they

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.670 
stalkers were quickly surrounded they
couldn't<00:00:27.869> really<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.109> away<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.410> couldn't

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
couldn't really get away they couldn't

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.259 
couldn't really get away they couldn't
use<00:00:28.769> their<00:00:28.920> speed<00:00:29.189> even<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> blink<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
use their speed even the blink was of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
use their speed even the blink was of
limited<00:00:30.390> use<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.260> comes<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> combo<00:00:31.949> here

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
limited use and here comes a combo here

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.760 
limited use and here comes a combo here
comes<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.759> Phoenix<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.510> void<00:00:33.750> ray<00:00:33.960> combo<00:00:34.200> using

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to just power down that Queen you can

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
to just power down that Queen you can
see<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.850> Protoss<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.719> the

they can't get us around the Zerg want

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.420 
they can't get us around the Zerg want

to wrap around their enemy but the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.709 
to wrap around their enemy but the
Protoss<00:00:59.820> want<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> fight<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> narrow

Protoss want to fight in a narrow

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
Protoss want to fight in a narrow
frontage<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.590> products<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
frontage and the products have that

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
frontage and the products have that
advantage<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> Zerg<00:01:03.180> didn't<00:01:03.420> like

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
advantage there so the Zerg didn't like

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
advantage there so the Zerg didn't like
it<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:04.019> moved<00:01:04.260> away<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:04.830> they're<00:01:04.949> going

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it they moved away and now they're going

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.710 
it they moved away and now they're going
to<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.790> kind<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.030> damage<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.510> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
to see what kind of damage they can do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
to see what kind of damage they can do
and<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.020> appears<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.860> fairly<00:01:08.430> helpless

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and what appears to be a fairly helpless

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.640 
and what appears to be a fairly helpless
Protoss<00:01:09.390> base<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.229> David

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
Protoss base so it looks like David

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
Protoss base so it looks like David
Kim's<00:01:10.830> main<00:01:11.130> base<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.540> defenseless

Kim's main base is very very defenseless
at<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.290> point<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> couple<00:01:13.890> of

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
as well a lot of Queens have been

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.830 
as well a lot of Queens have been
destroyed<00:04:02.879> that's<00:04:03.060> very<00:04:03.329> important<00:04:03.659> for<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
destroyed that's very important for the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.420 
destroyed that's very important for the
Zerg<00:04:03.989> not<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.229> lose<00:04:04.379> those<00:04:04.500> Queens<00:04:04.769> but<00:04:05.189> still

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
Zerg not to lose those Queens but still

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.219 
Zerg not to lose those Queens but still
the<00:04:05.790> damage<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.299> done<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.659> zerglings<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:07.139> out

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
the damage is done the zerglings are out

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:08.599 
the damage is done the zerglings are out
here<00:04:07.409> comes<00:04:07.530> some<00:04:07.709> corn<00:04:07.919> Fester's<00:04:08.280> waddling

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
here comes some corn Fester's waddling

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.159 
here comes some corn Fester's waddling
around<00:04:08.729> the<00:04:08.879> map<00:04:09.030> for<00:04:09.449> quickly<00:04:09.810> burling

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
around the map for quickly burling

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.809 
around the map for quickly burling
underground<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.979> can<00:04:11.099> see<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.370> stalkers<00:04:11.729> are

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
underground you can see the stalkers are

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.159 
underground you can see the stalkers are
trying<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.180> do<00:04:12.269> some<00:04:12.419> damage<00:04:12.540> trying<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.079> get

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
trying to do some damage trying to get

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.360 
trying to do some damage trying to get
to<00:04:13.259> the<00:04:13.290> base<00:04:13.470> see<00:04:13.620> what<00:04:13.709> they<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:13.829> do<00:04:14.009> it's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
to the base see what they can do it's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.949 
to the base see what they can do it's
too<00:04:14.549> many<00:04:14.759> zerglings<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.329> they're<00:04:15.659> quickly

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
too many zerglings and they're quickly

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.409 
too many zerglings and they're quickly
overcome<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.650> another<00:04:17.039> Protoss<00:04:17.820> attack<00:04:18.180> is

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
overcome and another Protoss attack is

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.349 
overcome and another Protoss attack is
pushed<00:04:18.989> back<00:04:19.229> by<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.620> Zerg<00:04:20.009> who<00:04:20.489> losing<00:04:21.029> three

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
pushed back by the Zerg who losing three

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.750 
pushed back by the Zerg who losing three
Queens<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.779> a<00:04:21.810> really<00:04:22.289> big<00:04:22.650> deal<00:04:22.710> for<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.550> know

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
Queens is a really big deal for you know

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.310 
Queens is a really big deal for you know
at<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.029> point<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.450> he<00:04:24.719> really<00:04:25.050> needs<00:04:25.229> to

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
at this point because he really needs to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.100 
at this point because he really needs to
have<00:04:25.440> those<00:04:25.560> out<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.830> field

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
have those out on the field

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.189 
have those out on the field
give<00:04:26.259> him<00:04:26.439> that<00:04:26.620> extra<00:04:26.860> spawn<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:28.090> larvae<00:04:28.960> yeah

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
give him that extra spawn of larvae yeah

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.300 
give him that extra spawn of larvae yeah
he<00:04:29.319> really<00:04:29.500> needs<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.830> his<00:04:29.949> economy

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
he really needs that for his economy

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.499 
he really needs that for his economy
it's<00:04:30.400> very<00:04:30.580> very<00:04:30.729> important<00:04:31.030> but<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.300> see

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
it's very very important but you can see

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.719 
it's very very important but you can see
the<00:04:31.990> Protoss<00:04:32.379> player<00:04:32.710> here<00:04:32.949> is<00:04:33.039> also<00:04:33.400> teching

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
the Protoss player here is also teching

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.550 
the Protoss player here is also teching
oh<00:04:33.879> here<00:04:34.300> come<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.539> Zerg<00:04:34.689> moving<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.169> trying

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
oh here come the Zerg moving in trying

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.110 
oh here come the Zerg moving in trying
to<00:04:35.650> do<00:04:35.770> some<00:04:35.919> damage<00:04:36.039> but<00:04:36.189> the<00:04:36.370> photon<00:04:36.789> cannon

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
to do some damage but the photon cannon

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.610 
to do some damage but the photon cannon
is<00:04:37.270> going<00:04:37.539> to<00:04:37.599> keep<00:04:37.750> those<00:04:37.930> zerglings<00:04:38.349> at<00:04:38.469> bay

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
is going to keep those zerglings at bay

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.899 
is going to keep those zerglings at bay
they<00:04:38.830> can't<00:04:39.069> get<00:04:39.159> this<00:04:39.250> around<00:04:39.430> on<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.580> photon

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
they can't get this around on the photon

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.309 
they can't get this around on the photon
cannon<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.449> of<00:04:40.569> course<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.870> probes<00:04:41.110> could

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
cannon and of course the probes could

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.260 
cannon and of course the probes could
join<00:04:41.500> in<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.650> fight<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:41.979> here<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:43.060> real

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
join in the fight and here is the real

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.420 
join in the fight and here is the real
danger<00:04:43.780> Colossus<00:04:44.680> are<00:04:44.860> being<00:04:45.069> built<00:04:45.219> on<00:04:45.400> that

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
danger Colossus are being built on that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.820 
danger Colossus are being built on that
high<00:04:45.669> ground<00:04:45.909> location<00:04:46.389> by<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.050> Protoss<00:04:47.650> so

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
high ground location by the Protoss so

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.159 
high ground location by the Protoss so
that's<00:04:47.979> a<00:04:48.069> real<00:04:48.370> threat<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:49.419> this<00:04:49.599> Zerg<00:04:49.900> player

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
that's a real threat to this Zerg player

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.929 
that's a real threat to this Zerg player
so<00:04:50.560> I'd<00:04:50.650> David<00:04:50.919> Kim's<00:04:51.069> doing<00:04:51.219> a<00:04:51.370> little<00:04:51.520> stinky

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
so I'd David Kim's doing a little stinky

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.330 
so I'd David Kim's doing a little stinky
tech<00:04:52.300> up<00:04:52.509> there<00:04:52.750> building<00:04:53.229> those<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.800> robotics

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
tech up there building those to robotics

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.730 
tech up there building those to robotics
facilities<00:04:54.879> and<00:04:55.150> making<00:04:55.629> those<00:04:55.780> Colossus<00:04:56.319> out

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
facilities and making those Colossus out

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.830 
facilities and making those Colossus out
of<00:04:57.039> anywhere<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.639> Jung<00:04:58.150> ho<00:04:58.330> was<00:04:58.449> able<00:04:58.659> to<00:04:58.719> see

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
of anywhere that Jung ho was able to see

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.240 
of anywhere that Jung ho was able to see
so<00:04:58.990> far<00:04:59.169> David<00:04:59.409> Kim<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.740> gathering<00:05:00.009> out<00:05:00.189> in

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so far David Kim is gathering out in

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.830 
so far David Kim is gathering out in
front<00:05:00.370> his<00:05:00.520> base<00:05:00.639> but<00:05:00.819> because<00:05:01.240> those

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
front his base but because those

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.689 
front his base but because those
infestors<00:05:02.289> are<00:05:02.439> able<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.830> move<00:05:02.979> wall<00:05:03.340> burrowed

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
infestors are able to move wall burrowed

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.760 
infestors are able to move wall burrowed
Yunho<00:05:04.060> knows<00:05:04.270> exactly<00:05:04.779> what<00:05:05.110> David<00:05:05.379> Kim<00:05:05.529> is<00:05:05.650> up

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
Yunho knows exactly what David Kim is up

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.110 
Yunho knows exactly what David Kim is up
to<00:05:05.889> yeah<00:05:06.099> so<00:05:06.219> he's<00:05:06.400> seen<00:05:06.610> everything<00:05:06.879> that's

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
to yeah so he's seen everything that's

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.700 
to yeah so he's seen everything that's
going<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.419> there<00:05:07.629> of<00:05:07.900> course<00:05:08.169> hasn't<00:05:08.500> seen<00:05:08.620> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
going on there of course hasn't seen the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.619 
going on there of course hasn't seen the
Colossus<00:05:09.159> yet<00:05:09.340> he's<00:05:09.699> been<00:05:09.879> using<00:05:10.090> his<00:05:10.360> Scouts

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
Colossus yet he's been using his Scouts

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:11.999 
Colossus yet he's been using his Scouts
on<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:11.110> main<00:05:11.259> base<00:05:11.500> he<00:05:11.650> doesn't<00:05:11.889> know<00:05:11.949> the

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
on the main base he doesn't know the

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.709 
on the main base he doesn't know the
threat<00:05:12.279> of<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.490> Colossus<00:05:12.879> potentially<00:05:13.629> he's

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
threat of the Colossus potentially he's

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.119 
threat of the Colossus potentially he's
even<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.199> play<00:05:14.379> at<00:05:14.529> this<00:05:14.620> point<00:05:14.889> though<00:05:15.009> he

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
even in play at this point though he

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.740 
even in play at this point though he
could<00:05:15.340> guess<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:16.090> we<00:05:16.180> can<00:05:16.300> see<00:05:16.449> over<00:05:16.719> here

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
could guess and we can see over here

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.990 
could guess and we can see over here
there<00:05:17.050> is<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.650> warp<00:05:17.949> prism<00:05:18.340> over<00:05:18.610> here<00:05:18.759> this<00:05:18.879> is

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
there is a warp prism over here this is

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.149 
there is a warp prism over here this is
