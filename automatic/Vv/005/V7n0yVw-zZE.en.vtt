00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.490
 clearly according to her the program is not 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.950
 arranged to choose absolutely everything 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.349
 truth question even about this 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.670
 Sun cable or procter of some of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 the actors that therefore the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.450
 people who participate in this say 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.240
 everything you have to know because you see 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.380
 and it makes an explanation we were not 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.380
 in austerity she 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.820
 the same feeling and is a little the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 defense and really the explanation of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 clear cable when also gómez is not 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.460
 recording and can find your area 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.379
 the street we walk those connected with the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 high missing hand but when the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.680
 aggravating by working on the connector that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 is connected to the cell phone looking at it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 there is no director from any side that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.739
 you want preference I do not believe the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.739
 second of several aggressive 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.879
 pérez ante as a jazz program because 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.140
 some wineries all the big clouds 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 of the elderly drama of our 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.979
 history from the old ones because the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.110
 person ever the qatar if the see 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.970
 that another is this when what is not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.330
 the deadlines helps you to say today is what 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330
 What can happen 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.470
 we like this so much because some 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.920
 way we see each other in that we say yes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.899
 would have been downloading the performance in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.399
 the people who have what happens 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.350
 when it is transferred is violence 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.060
 also because as I said the julie has 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.560
 seen very violent reactions the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 participants good think of the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.580
 problem that sometimes you can invite me 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.110
 I think we helped partly as 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.810
 society to vote those bad thoughts 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.549
 that all are like infidels and we think 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.259
 in quotes to blame the other for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.810
 think the same fight that I would have done 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.549
 I in this case many users 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.549
 start the process 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.880
 as a positive it empathizes with the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.409
 participant or I would do the same thing is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 what would happen if I was living that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.840
 minute 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.369
 but I put that really about everything 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.259
 registered for the subject of the most people 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
 young although good you already know what 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.100
 includes or knows how to put the mind what 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.500
 I could hold the youngest goats myself 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.959
 I think that suddenly because this seems 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.959
 that clear that if dew has been a man 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.620
 with this girl that what you have with a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 man to the situation tensed by the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.330
 beginnings friends is curious also that 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.709
 while he is giving a campaign of the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.720
 government saying what was the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.580
 violence to women or not to the brawl 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.959
 between pololo also some way to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.739
 television is praised a little that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.739
 situation but speaking
