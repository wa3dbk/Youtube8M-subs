 Hello today we teaching cr 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.330
 simulator 2 version 2 2 10 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.210
 or differently 3d instructor and today 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.480
 going through a career first ready for 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.820
 initial movement so let's start for those 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.220
 who doesn't know this game costs 400 rubles 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 everything will be detailed under the description under 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:30.980
 this video so let's start and since i 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.350
 repeated earlier start here writes us 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.320
 first thing we need jealously 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.340
 fasten a belt then get 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.969
 engine turn left turn signal 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.920
 handbrake was getting filmed 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.879
 make sure no machines include the first 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.879
 speed going 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:04.900
 Here we move to the first transfer of us 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.130
 ask to switch to our heat 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.970
 the instructor tells us that we should 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.400
 slow down but we donâ€™t like to drive 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.610
 asks us again to switch to the first 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.360
 gear for bounced on the curb 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:30.560
 turn left turn nick look carrying 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.810
 turn the machines turn right 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.250
 turn signal drove onto the curb 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:44.390
 stopped turning off the engine all 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.640
 we have passed so we have the following 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.759
 proper parking in the background 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:56.200
 I will see you off for a long time. 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.910
 so we have exercises we need 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:08.929
 park in reverse and so we start 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:11.890
 we start the engine and go back 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.890
 convey life 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:43.970
 have not yet become we have passed it on two stars 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:51.799
 and so the next exercise is snake so 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:55.010
 we start the snake exercise before 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.130
 corps on the role is much easier to do 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.220
 than on the button so if you 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.950
 going to acquire this game 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.700
 I'm telling you, get a steering wheel right away 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.630
 exercise star the next exercise 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 slide the easiest exercise to my 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.739
 a look so let's start here we stand near 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:26.109
 slides true and drive up stop and 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:26.109
 touch again and I drove the table line 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.750
 asks to put the car on the handbrake 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.310
 put the car on the handbrake and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.180
 now we need to move not 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.450
 having rolled 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.450
 back mark 1 gears get under way 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.080
 we passed this assignment on 3 stars and 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.250
 the next exercise we have movement in 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.240
 the city is wrong with us 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.710
 movement exercises in the city you should 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.140
 take the route 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.560
 without gross violations of the road 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.560
 movements 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:30.180
 on the right we have a map on the left 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.560
 digital speedometer 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.820
 tell me the answer to the 3D instructor 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.510
 slow down a little 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 because the city â€‹â€‹can only go 60 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.830
 and me 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:05:00.730
 ayat lead 68 is not a law violation 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:05:04.740
 rules seriously so we have the way us 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:08.919
 to be fined we must move on 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:12.280
 more than 10 kilometers per hour example 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.690
 allowed 60 then we will move 7071 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.690
 it was then on penalties 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.620
 i'm seriously talking to you for a lot easier 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.050
 drive a car in this game than on 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:48.210
 ok button here is generally unrealistic yes 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.210
 yes here I am not to blame 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:09.149
 also here you can shoot down pedestrians 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:12.599
 if you knock down a pedestrian that is 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:16.019
 do it on or on this career 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.739
 happens then you start the task 

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:19.559
 again 

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:22.499
 and if it happens it is free busy 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:27.059
 then you just made thousands 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:29.879
 hitting a pedestrian just writes that you 

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:33.179
 perfectly if there is no pedestrian 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:39.389
 do nothing and violated writes that you 

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:41.189
 knocked it all and I already have one point 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.899
 took off because they looked at 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:45.740
 speeds moved seventy six 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.740
 kilometers per hour 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.760
 zvizdets cool 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:08:00.470
 rubles having finished on the right we will be we all 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:01.940
