especially if you're jailbroken and
you're<00:00:42.850> on<00:00:42.940> an<00:00:43.089> older<00:00:43.390> device<00:00:43.719> such<00:00:44.260> as<00:00:44.289> an

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
you're on an older device such as an

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.910 
you're on an older device such as an
iphone<00:00:45.539> 3g<00:00:46.539> or<00:00:46.690> an<00:00:47.019> ipod<00:00:47.320> touch<00:00:47.530> 2nd

generation<00:00:48.100> which<00:00:48.549> are<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.789> only<00:00:48.940> two

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:49.119 
generation which are the only two

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.609 
generation which are the only two
devices<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.659> the<00:00:49.839> jailbreak<00:00:50.199> currently

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
devices that the jailbreak currently

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:53.100 
devices that the jailbreak currently
works<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.129> you<00:00:51.369> have<00:00:51.579> multitasking<00:00:52.479> enabled

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
works and you have multitasking enabled

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.410 
works and you have multitasking enabled
you'll<00:00:53.559> notice<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:54.519> works<00:00:54.760> really<00:00:55.210> well

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
you'll notice it works really well

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.899 
you'll notice it works really well
however<00:00:56.320> there<00:00:56.649> are<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.769> few<00:00:56.949> downfalls<00:00:57.519> to<00:00:57.789> it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
however there are a few downfalls to it

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.660 
however there are a few downfalls to it
the<00:00:58.269> first<00:00:58.629> being<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.260> reasons<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.190> Apple's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
the first being the reasons that Apple's

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.649 
the first being the reasons that Apple's
added<00:01:01.059> now<00:01:01.570> apparently<00:01:02.469> if<00:01:02.799> you<00:01:03.659> enable

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
added now apparently if you enable

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.529 
added now apparently if you enable
multitasking<00:01:05.319> like<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.159> most<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:07.149> you<00:01:07.210> will

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
multitasking like so most of you will

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.029 
multitasking like so most of you will
notice<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.020> you'll<00:01:08.319> have<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.470> bunch<00:01:08.890> of

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
notice that you'll have a bunch of

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.830 
notice that you'll have a bunch of
different<00:01:09.159> things<00:01:09.610> down<00:01:09.880> here<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.270> those<00:01:10.810> are

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
different things down here and those are

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.419 
different things down here and those are
all<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.289> reasons<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:11.920> you've<00:01:12.159> actually

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
all the reasons that you've actually

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.529 
all the reasons that you've actually
used<00:01:13.030> now<00:01:13.890> unfortunately<00:01:14.940> there's<00:01:15.940> no<00:01:16.270> way<00:01:16.479> to

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
used now unfortunately there's no way to

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.240 
used now unfortunately there's no way to
get<00:01:16.750> rid<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.049> those<00:01:17.319> and<00:01:17.590> there's<00:01:17.770> no<00:01:17.979> way<00:01:18.220> to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
get rid of those and there's no way to

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.969 
get rid of those and there's no way to
distinguish<00:01:19.030> between<00:01:19.299> which<00:01:20.289> ones<00:01:20.619> are

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
distinguish between which ones are

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.669 
distinguish between which ones are
actually<00:01:21.539> backgrounding<00:01:22.539> and<00:01:22.690> which<00:01:23.319> ones

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
actually backgrounding and which ones

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.580 
actually backgrounding and which ones
are<00:01:24.069> actually<00:01:24.310> just<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.240> your<00:01:25.539> recess<00:01:26.049> or<00:01:26.319> your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
are actually just I your recess or your

the help of a hack from Cydia there is a

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.210 
the help of a hack from Cydia there is a
way<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.700> completely<00:01:34.569> remove<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.770> reasons

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
way to completely remove the reasons

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.839 
way to completely remove the reasons
which<00:01:36.489> I<00:01:36.670> found<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.300> be<00:01:37.450> very<00:01:37.569> nice<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.770> also<00:01:39.550> I
