00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.829
 maybe save more progress yes 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.339
 score 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.619
 I write is on 18 new score 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:18.890
 The End 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 No, that's the weakest game to slip out of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.419
 At a marquee it says 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.029
 now stood 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.029
 Areas successful 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.900
 I thought to go along 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.710
 Look at Ashton 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.130
 like the last time was new patch which in the credits as extra parties 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.180
 put and 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.430
 What can I say I hope we had almost exactly as I had fun 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 sometimes the game was a bit of a nerve, but a nerve break 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.910
 In the end it was already a bit fun 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.110
 just a sometimes or most driven to despair with theirs 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.300
 terrible Samson with this terrible control thank you Crystal 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.190
 Dynamics and Alexiou reviews a Doctor Faith 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.360
 which block the threshing floor Red Faisst Kilian 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.660
 On the whole, I think it's not a good game unfortunately 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.920
 The graphics were good and the control I drink this right 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.480
 Good for me to Murder game if you look at the Alpine Tour of the players 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.980
 look 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.650
 especially the 3 or 3 tune on and what 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.540
 they are then I look 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.340
 rather heavy or the first tour old that is during the remake of the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.289
 First he probably played it 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.210
 the old version 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.650
 I would have gotten big problems and I'm not going to 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.600
 arrived at the end 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.560
 I think it was worth it I hope you had fun with this game 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.850
 and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.110
 yes and we see each other bandage at the next LP again and again 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.310
 and paragraph 2 is now it's about time I finish now 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 as Reeses LP I am not sure what you will that is still Pokemon 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.059
 just take a look 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.859
 how it looks with that 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.209
 and 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.489
 Yes, I am crushing Frau Roth or, like Waldorf, it is too soon 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.150
 The End 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.880
 and we are all here the Voice Acting 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.860
 I think that in the American voices and the docu it pulls you here 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.109
 Kilel House has spoken to Lara Croft okay 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:35.229
 I never know that their children are already leading the way in Germany 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:37.689
 Brand hopes in the movie 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.689
 5 certainly have and how that kind of thing but 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:42.499
 no matter 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.159
 so rushes Connys by shot long ago is likely of the end 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:52.150
 Banse the people on the computer plays that is already Vienna film can 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.879
 you almost say 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.549
 perfect is like a movie 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.290
 he wants Bernard Crystal Dynamics to be full pawn right now thanks to man here and oh

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.409
 on a reef hair trends white shades Zickenkrieg 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.439
 presented very differently and places clear 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.869
 from their data they 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:14.489
 Kate loves Roger Merz 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.489
 and now here are the important people 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.709
 premiere 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 sometimes like to look this bad 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.769
 kicked in the butt 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.769
 the act is what that is the leading one 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.019
 actor 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.000
 no idea 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.799
 actor 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.309
 i dont mind it maybe lives here as an example taken for 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.949
 some figures like the statements 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.429
 well no matter 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.759
 Lyondell wakes up 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:48.499
 SIGNO designers so a lot of people involved in computer games 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.379
 It's madness 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.289
 that's probably why you should 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.309
 what could become Tobias Mahnke Tomb Raider Anniversary and any need like 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.119
 to Thank Euro misses 1 1 percent continuing Mackenroth Tomb Raider 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.359
 Anniversary 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.579
 yes, all the companies are coming 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.199
 and all of them started with their family 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.949
 behind her relatives 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.949
 not to forget under her pet 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.590
 I think 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.430
 you can see how many people are working on a computer game and that's why 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.800
 is it worthwhile sometimes to buy the computer game? 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.710
 instead of getting it from the internet or somewhere else 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:29.909
 and 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:31.479
 Yes, that's why 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.270
 from several times to this game one 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.620
 Buy recommendation for those 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.319
 they are a little bit 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.449
 Dinkhoff he wanted to bring the purchase to smoking 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.069
 you can say that 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.689
 and 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.099
 I think if you are worried that you are quiet 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.360
 that one shows too 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.210
 the latter is quite ambitious »stupid 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.750
 On a RIAA and Furth make available commercial went as one 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.229
 just says 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.089
 BP does not want 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.720
 and what things are available under Uribe right 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.820
 but sets equal role plays and looked even more attractive and with 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.039
 last is 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.569
 Sports you even people to buy the first leg has its so much fun I do 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.759
 have already bought so much games because of the so far and therefore 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.929
 Merchants play and indicate to the poster the beer 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.230
 OLG void the latter is adversely affect and you games 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.900
 not uphill rolling content already knows or even from the internet 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.039
 download 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.779
 but no matter this snake that is eternal that heat itself does not mind 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.409
 last time was 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.919
 yes the last time Maxda was still something else 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.699
 I could do that 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 say more now I do not think anything means that such numbers 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:53.330
 yes, yes 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.069
 I called the packaging was in front of a powerful Said a powerful syndicate 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.490
 commissioned Lara Croft with the encounter 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.819
 the one with the salvation I can not read and God's will 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:07.240
 With the salvage of Iran a mischief meets tables Arte father already 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.560
 Many adventures and life cost Lara starts an expedition to 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:14.200
 abandoned calves and untouched worlds 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.039
 pursued by terrifying value 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.080
 Tuchel and the Wars 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.059

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.859
 Desperate into the possession of Iran and its mysterious powers too 

00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:32.419
 bundle up 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.000
 A race for life and death begins 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.310
 fall ten years on the district in their brand new adventure 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.440
 inspired by the first part of the Tomb Raider series 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.920
 Often the most popular successful action-adventure game ever 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.029
 is the most popular and sometimes doubted that it looks like control 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.029
 but no matter old that's it that was the end 

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.889
 As I said thank you for watching everyone I thank you for that 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.879
 Apple's initiated ones are the ones who just click in 

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:08.039
 and thereby seek helpers and what to find hope and hope 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:11.880
 Thank you to all who have looked at this flatrate also 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.749
 If I want to do it then we have to open the game from Geleen Adolf 

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:18.309
 bought Thomas Hopfer Thormählen buys so a little more borrowed from him 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.300

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.509
 In addition, thanks I'll see all the people who looked at the road 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:26.139
 to have 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.660
 and look at the salutation of two of us 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.780
 If you still feel like 2 Mader I recommend from Max is new last he 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.029

 and yes warmer can not get enough of Tuvalu is last and likes to pull 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.259
