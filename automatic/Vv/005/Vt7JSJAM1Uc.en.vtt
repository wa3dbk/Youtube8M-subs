we're going to see if we can make the
ps1<00:01:54.000> town<00:01:54.740> classic<00:01:55.740> better<00:01:56.040> holy<00:01:56.969> crap<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
ps1 town classic better holy crap that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.440 
ps1 town classic better holy crap that
actually<00:01:58.140> worked<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.399> turned<00:02:00.329> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually worked what I turned on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
actually worked what I turned on
smoothing<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> loss<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> stars

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
smoothing and the loss out of the stars

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.590 
smoothing and the loss out of the stars
no<00:02:02.820> longer<00:02:03.149> big<00:02:03.360> jagged<00:02:03.840> pixels<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:06.210> uh<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
no longer big jagged pixels I just uh I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.969 
no longer big jagged pixels I just uh I
guess<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> smoothing<00:02:07.380> kind<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> works<00:02:07.829> for

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
guess the smoothing kind of works for

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.650 
guess the smoothing kind of works for
ps1<00:02:08.250> games<00:02:08.610> well<00:02:09.060> too<00:02:10.020> bad<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.379> doesn't
