00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
okay now I got to get the sprocket on to

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.690 
okay now I got to get the sprocket on to
the<00:00:10.210> rear<00:00:10.450> wheel<00:00:10.750> and<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:12.130> you<00:00:12.250> can<00:00:12.340> see<00:00:12.400> in<00:00:12.580> my

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
the rear wheel and as you can see in my

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.119 
the rear wheel and as you can see in my
case<00:00:12.760> it<00:00:13.150> doesn't<00:00:13.330> fit<00:00:13.660> quite<00:00:13.690> right<00:00:14.049> so<00:00:14.799> what

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
case it doesn't fit quite right so what

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.880 
case it doesn't fit quite right so what
better<00:00:15.250> excuse<00:00:15.790> than<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:16.090> use<00:00:16.270> my<00:00:16.510> new<00:00:16.900> CNC

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
better excuse than to use my new CNC

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.940 
better excuse than to use my new CNC
mill<00:00:18.840> don't<00:00:19.840> really<00:00:20.080> need<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.259> CNC<00:00:20.800> mill

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
mill don't really need a CNC mill

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.609 
mill don't really need a CNC mill
probably<00:00:21.910> could<00:00:22.060> use<00:00:22.090> just<00:00:22.240> a<00:00:22.570> file<00:00:22.840> but<00:00:23.170> this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
probably could use just a file but this

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.060 
probably could use just a file but this
is<00:00:23.739> more<00:00:23.950> fun<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.960> as<00:00:26.169> you<00:00:26.290> can<00:00:26.349> see<00:00:26.439> here<00:00:26.739> I<00:00:26.770> set

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
is more fun so as you can see here I set

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.010 
is more fun so as you can see here I set
it<00:00:27.160> up<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:28.419> dial<00:00:28.660> gauge<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.950> do<00:00:30.939> some<00:00:31.419> tapping

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
it up the dial gauge and do some tapping

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020 
it up the dial gauge and do some tapping
and<00:00:32.140> adjusting<00:00:32.619> on<00:00:32.829> this<00:00:33.309> wood<00:00:33.520> block<00:00:33.790> which

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
and adjusting on this wood block which

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.080 
and adjusting on this wood block which
is<00:00:34.059> attached<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.750> rotary<00:00:35.050> table<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:36.100> I

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
is attached to the rotary table and I

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.330 
is attached to the rotary table and I
kind<00:00:37.450> of<00:00:37.510> check<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.870> make<00:00:38.020> sure<00:00:38.200> that<00:00:38.470> the<00:00:38.739> it

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
kind of check to make sure that the it

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.470 
kind of check to make sure that the it
is<00:00:39.550> centered<00:00:40.239> onto<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.539> rotary<00:00:40.870> table<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
is centered onto the rotary table that

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.110 
is centered onto the rotary table that
way<00:00:43.600> I'm<00:00:43.719> not<00:00:43.870> cutting<00:00:44.769> them<00:00:44.859> oblong<00:00:45.489> oval<00:00:45.730> or

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
way I'm not cutting them oblong oval or

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.310 
way I'm not cutting them oblong oval or
something<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:48.850> can<00:00:48.969> see<00:00:49.120> we're<00:00:49.539> cutting

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
something here you can see we're cutting

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.270 
something here you can see we're cutting
the<00:00:51.359> inner<00:00:52.359> edge<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.780> that<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.530> inner<00:00:53.739> radius

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
the inner edge of that the inner radius

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.329 
the inner edge of that the inner radius
or<00:00:54.640> diameter<00:00:54.940> of<00:00:55.359> that<00:00:55.510> hole<00:00:56.050> making<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.219> a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
or diameter of that hole making it a

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.540 
or diameter of that hole making it a
little<00:00:57.609> bit<00:00:57.789> bigger<00:00:57.969> so<00:00:59.129> it'll<00:01:00.129> fit<00:01:00.280> over<00:01:00.489> it

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
little bit bigger so it'll fit over it

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.549 
little bit bigger so it'll fit over it
it<00:01:00.940> didn't<00:01:01.329> need<00:01:01.480> but<00:01:01.719> probably<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.140> millimeter

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
it didn't need but probably a millimeter

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.230 
it didn't need but probably a millimeter
cut<00:01:02.859> off<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:05.050> can<00:01:05.260> see<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.590> mach3<00:01:06.490> program

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
cut off you can see the mach3 program

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.950 
cut off you can see the mach3 program
that's<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.310> know<00:01:09.540> indexing<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.570> cutter

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
that's you know indexing that cutter

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
that's you know indexing that cutter
head<00:01:11.439> just<00:01:11.649> a<00:01:11.770> little<00:01:11.799> bit<00:01:12.070> at<00:01:12.189> a<00:01:12.280> time<00:01:12.310> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
head just a little bit at a time and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.340 
head just a little bit at a time and
then<00:01:13.810> rotating<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.409> wheel<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.000> sprocket

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.300 

and<00:01:20.350> there<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:20.979> go

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
and there we go

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.209 
and there we go
not<00:01:21.939> fits<00:01:22.270> over<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.509> little<00:01:23.350> hub<00:01:23.649> part<00:01:24.009> of

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
not fits over that little hub part of

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:31.620 
not fits over that little hub part of
the<00:01:24.719> rear<00:01:25.719> wheel<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.119> can<00:01:31.240> see<00:01:31.360> how<00:01:31.509> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the rear wheel here you can see how it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.020 
the rear wheel here you can see how it
fits<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.350> flip<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.579> to<00:01:33.820> play<00:01:34.000> with

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
fits you can flip you have to play with

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.170 
fits you can flip you have to play with
this<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.509> can<00:01:34.600> flip<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.990> inside<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:36.180> outside

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
this you can flip it inside or outside

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.330 
this you can flip it inside or outside
because<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:37.869> can<00:01:37.960> see<00:01:38.079> that<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.590> sprocket<00:01:39.219> is

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
because you can see that the sprocket is

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.429 
because you can see that the sprocket is
a<00:01:39.430> inner<00:01:40.149> side<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.750> outer<00:01:40.899> side<00:01:41.170> they<00:01:41.289> can

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
a inner side and the outer side they can

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
a inner side and the outer side they can
go<00:01:41.560> either<00:01:41.740> way<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.829> rubber

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
go either way and here with the rubber

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.480 
go either way and here with the rubber
pieces<00:01:46.530> they<00:01:47.530> come<00:01:47.770> with<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> kit<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.250> have<00:01:48.280> to

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
pieces they come with a kit you have to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.060 
pieces they come with a kit you have to
cut<00:01:48.759> them<00:01:48.880> open<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.680> have<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.890> play<00:01:51.039> with

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
cut them open and you have to play with

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.130 
cut them open and you have to play with
them<00:01:51.310> too<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.560> may<00:01:53.770> need<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.420> put<00:01:55.630> both<00:01:55.990> of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
them too you may need to put both of

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.370 
them too you may need to put both of
them<00:01:56.259> on<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.350> inside<00:01:56.770> edge<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.380> inside

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
them on the inside edge of the inside

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
them on the inside edge of the inside
where<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.680> hub<00:01:59.829> is<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.189> I'm<00:02:00.310> doing<00:02:00.579> here

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
where the hub is like I'm doing here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.969 
where the hub is like I'm doing here
or<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.780> might<00:02:01.930> need<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.170> put<00:02:02.289> one<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.829> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
or you might need to put one on the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.580 
or you might need to put one on the
outer<00:02:03.490> edge<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.820> kind<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.390> give<00:02:05.140> yourself<00:02:05.259> a

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
outer edge to kind of give yourself a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.230 
outer edge to kind of give yourself a
little<00:02:05.619> bit<00:02:05.829> more<00:02:05.890> offset<00:02:06.549> for<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.939> sprocket

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
little bit more offset for the sprocket

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.950 
little bit more offset for the sprocket
basically<00:02:10.240> they<00:02:10.360> have<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.539> play<00:02:10.690> with<00:02:10.869> it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
basically they have to play with it

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.270 
basically they have to play with it
because<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.230> want<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> get<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.650> sprocket<00:02:12.100> to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
because you want to get the sprocket to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.700 
because you want to get the sprocket to
be<00:02:13.180> perfectly<00:02:13.900> aligned<00:02:14.290> with<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:15.580> smaller

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
be perfectly aligned with the smaller

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.580 
be perfectly aligned with the smaller
cog<00:02:17.710> on<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.280> engine

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
cog on the engine

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
cog on the engine
so<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.190> chain<00:02:20.400> won't<00:02:20.550> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.819> come<00:02:20.970> off<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
so the chain won't want to come off and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.280 
so the chain won't want to come off and
and<00:02:21.959> your<00:02:22.290> chain<00:02:22.530> won't<00:02:22.709> rub<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> wheel

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
and your chain won't rub on the wheel

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.870 
and your chain won't rub on the wheel
here<00:02:25.290> I'm<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.709> lining<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.250> you'll<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.760> that

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
fit I really had to force it on quite

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:24.310 
fit I really had to force it on quite
hard<00:05:21.010> just<00:05:22.010> make<00:05:22.190> sure<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.460> get<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:23.140> set<00:05:24.140> all

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
hard just make sure you get it set all

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.510 
hard just make sure you get it set all
the<00:05:24.440> way<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:25.900> then<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.530> first<00:05:27.740> test<00:05:28.010> run

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
the way on and then the first test run

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.430 
the way on and then the first test run
I<00:05:28.550> noticed<00:05:29.030> the<00:05:29.360> carburetor<00:05:29.780> just<00:05:30.050> would<00:05:30.290> not

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
I noticed the carburetor just would not

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.870 
I noticed the carburetor just would not
run<00:05:30.680> right<00:05:30.890> so<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.220> decider<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.700> going<00:05:31.820> to

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
run right so the decider is going to

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.120 
run right so the decider is going to
take<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.060> apart<00:05:32.300> and<00:05:32.570> as<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.290> took<00:05:33.350> it<00:05:33.620> off<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:33.920> saw

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
take it apart and as I took it off I saw

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.240
