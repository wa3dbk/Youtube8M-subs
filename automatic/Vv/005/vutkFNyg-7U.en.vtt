00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:10.440
 From here, I think that I would like to give an explanatory lecture on inorganic substances. 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:16.379
 Well, first of all, I explained from what kind of thing this inorganic substance says 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.610
 I think I want to, but the substance in this world is this inorganic substance and then 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.370
 Another one 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:28.450
 I can boil it for what kind of organic matter 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:33.700
 What organic compounds in inorganic material and organic matter because this is organic matter is basically a compound 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.660
 It is said that it can be classified as this, but it can be classified to this High school chemistry 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.590
 Well then 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.360
 I will study this inorganic substance first and then 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.430
 That's what it takes to study organic compounds 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.420
 When I integrated what do Rena in inorganic substance Toka organic compound but I'm a not become the order 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.320
 It is to say 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.290
 this 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:01:00.110
 The point is that there is no such thing as this machine. 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:04.100
 What does it mean? This is what we say about the human mind in two ways. 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 It 's a machine tree when it's all about it 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 This tree is a machine tree and there is a switch for opportunities 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 It moves when you press the switch, but it moves when you do not do something from the outside like that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.520
 It is near that there is not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:25.530
 People and hearts are influenced by their surroundings, rather than moving on their own. 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.330
 It's a person's mind that moves is something similar to an opportunity just like that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.300
 It's like I'm a machine that the heart of a cat's heart is broken 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:40.870
 It is about whether or not that mind is passed, but it is Kore that there is heart 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:44.710
 It is a weak creature, so it is a life form, so an organic compound is produced by a life form 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.320
 I'm say in the wind that substance it organic compounds, such as 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.370
 Conversely, if you say inorganic matter degree this seems to be 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.140
 It means that it is a substance that has nothing to do with the living thing you entered 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.430
 Now, for now, you are learning about inorganic substances. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.360
 I would like to give a detailed explanation of the organic compounds in Haha 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.020
 After all, inorganic substances have nothing to do with living organisms 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 So what do you say specifically what you say? 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.140
 Easy-to-understand the things that were said, It is a conversation with a good child is this is life type of matter 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 Not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:25.350
 These things are not living beings, so we talk with such material doctors, sand, etc. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.670
 I also learned what kind of ingredients are made of ingredients. 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:34.500
 And then it's a metal that's a lump of metal 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.120
 About these things does not mean 1 thing You also learn about the metal 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.250
 Or expect 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.930
 There are opportunities such as Kochi or oxygen, but this is also an inorganic substance. 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.370
 Taking the few examples 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.049
 Saying even though it not be something like this 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:55.980
 This is to say an inorganic substance kind of thing You're life forms unrelated to substance 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.980
 So here I would like to explain it in detail .
