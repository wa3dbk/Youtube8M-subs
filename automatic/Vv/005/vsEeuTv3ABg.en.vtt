00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.660
 Personal speech I 'm already uploaded in this video 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.480
 is showing you how to get 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.240
 400 thousand gold and 800 million gold 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.900
 good experience first you will create 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.260
 a game in the adventure mode is in the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.120
 Suicide 6 and will go hunting for hotel 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.720
 That's because faith is hellish. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.059
 done that I advise you to put 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.890
 ability to get around the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.409
 first level of the weekend none 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.449
 good that you do not have to be putting 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.640
 here is the teleportation and I'm going to 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.040
 illusionist 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.290
 then I talk to level 1 of the queue and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.519
 this first part only you pass 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.519
 running without killing any monster 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.619
 reminding staff that this good thing is 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 It's good for you to do a group with a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.409
 Good composition, for example, far 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.090
 front touching and then those behind 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.680
 killing the monsters because here on the level 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.680
 2 will have to kill everyone 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.880
 so you're going to kill and the little animals 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 had entry 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 then you will put your skills 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.259
 normal to pass level 2 here you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.259
 will have to kill everyone 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.119
 if I put a relative here 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.090
 come back here for change 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.960
 done that as I said you will have 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.580
 that tie the map does not kill all the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 monsters 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.870
 the difference of this street here is that the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 monsters are very slow is and is not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.750
 difficult for you to complete from 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.550
 Swiss light six in some cases will have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.650
 this monster who is the sledgehammer 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.550
 only that it is not too difficult to 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.660
 kill 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.769
 so even if he's there you're going 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.840
 get 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:40.700
 He 's too slow to flee from the attacks. 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:45.299
 it and is the biggest difficulty is to find 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:56.180
 if you're going to be if he's here more 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:56.180
 it's not always that he's here in the palm 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.610
 the attack also the tortoise of the capiroto 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.360
 There are four more rattlesnakes here. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:41.210
 and 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:45.350
 the laughter here to the Flemish 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.330
 well that's it personal 421 thousand in gold 81 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.480
 millions of experience but what you 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.640
 He managed to kill the monsters here is 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.790
 the arrangement very fast you get a 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.730
 Good goal now that the house is gone 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.480
 a good experience auction as well 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.760
 good the video was this is the first video 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.720
 of the channel so if you liked the one 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.390
 I like to show your friends there. 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.150
 Grandma to watch too and subscribe 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.919
 in the channel to give that force 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.919
 well, that's even better
