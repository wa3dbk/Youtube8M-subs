00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
volumes now what you really want to look

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.740 
volumes now what you really want to look
for<00:00:32.650> when<00:00:32.769> you<00:00:32.890> have<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.400> DVD<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> video<00:00:34.300> TS

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
for when you have a DVD is the video TS

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.540 
for when you have a DVD is the video TS
folder<00:00:35.140> which<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.350> going<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.710> be<00:00:35.830> on<00:00:35.949> every<00:00:36.250> DVD

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
folder which is going to be on every DVD

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.030 
folder which is going to be on every DVD
pretty<00:00:36.879> much<00:00:37.089> but<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:38.350> reason<00:00:38.530> that<00:00:38.710> this<00:00:38.890> is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
pretty much but the reason that this is

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.710 
pretty much but the reason that this is
important<00:00:39.580> is<00:00:39.760> because<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.360> don't<00:00:40.540> actually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
important is because you don't actually

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.079 
important is because you don't actually
have<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.140> rip<00:00:41.409> from<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.769> DVD<00:00:42.040> you<00:00:42.760> could<00:00:42.940> have<00:00:43.030> a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
have to rip from a DVD you could have a

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.270 
have to rip from a DVD you could have a
folder<00:00:43.540> with<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.780> video<00:00:44.140> TS<00:00:44.440> folder<00:00:44.799> in<00:00:44.949> it<00:00:45.070> or

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
folder with the video TS folder in it or

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.890 
folder with the video TS folder in it or
you<00:00:45.699> could<00:00:45.850> have<00:00:45.879> an<00:00:46.059> image<00:00:46.330> with<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> video

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
you could have an image with the video

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.020 
you could have an image with the video
TS<00:00:47.199> folder<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:47.650> it<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:48.250> important<00:00:48.699> thing<00:00:48.760> is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
TS folder in it the important thing is

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.750 
TS folder in it the important thing is
that<00:00:49.059> video<00:00:49.510> underscore<00:00:50.409> TS<00:00:50.739> folder<00:00:51.100> exists

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
that video underscore TS folder exists

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.729 
that video underscore TS folder exists
so<00:00:52.449> I'm<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.720> go<00:00:52.809> ahead<00:00:52.839> and<00:00:53.260> click<00:00:53.470> open

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
so I'm going to go ahead and click open

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.549 
so I'm going to go ahead and click open
and<00:00:54.040> then<00:00:54.820> handbrake<00:00:55.390> is<00:00:55.510> going<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.930> scan<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
and then handbrake is going to scan the

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.570 
and then handbrake is going to scan the
source<00:00:56.860> for<00:00:57.489> files<00:00:57.760> that<00:00:58.059> it's<00:00:58.239> able<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.629> rip

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
source for files that it's able to rip

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.939 
source for files that it's able to rip
to<00:01:00.580> another<00:01:00.790> format<00:01:01.089> now<00:01:01.930> once<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.680> done

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
to another format now once it's done

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.510 
to another format now once it's done
because<00:01:03.939> this<00:01:04.299> is<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.869> DVD<00:01:05.710> with<00:01:05.860> television

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
because this is a DVD with television

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.520 
because this is a DVD with television
episodes<00:01:06.970> on<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.390> we're<00:01:08.080> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.229> see<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.439> lot

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
episodes on it we're going to see a lot

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.730 
episodes on it we're going to see a lot
of<00:01:08.770> options<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:10.240> area<00:01:10.689> under<00:01:11.170> title<00:01:11.560> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
of options in this area under title and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.380 
of options in this area under title and
that<00:01:12.159> will<00:01:12.280> be<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.429> case<00:01:12.520> with<00:01:12.789> movies<00:01:13.210> too

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that will be the case with movies too

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.389 
that will be the case with movies too
because<00:01:13.689> movies<00:01:13.990> often<00:01:14.140> have<00:01:14.469> extra<00:01:15.009> features

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
because movies often have extra features

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.370 
because movies often have extra features
and<00:01:15.670> other<00:01:15.759> things<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.359> so<00:01:16.990> when<00:01:17.259> you're

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and other things and so when you're

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.499 
and other things and so when you're
ripping<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.859> title<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.820> only<00:01:19.030> thing<00:01:19.179> handbrake

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
ripping a title the only thing handbrake

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.389 
ripping a title the only thing handbrake
is<00:01:19.539> going<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.020> give<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.469> how<00:01:20.950> long<00:01:21.189> that

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
is going to give you is how long that

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.109 
is going to give you is how long that
title<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.630> track<00:01:22.840> number<00:01:23.229> now<00:01:24.119> that's

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
title is and the track number now that's

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.389 
title is and the track number now that's
not<00:01:25.380> necessarily<00:01:26.380> enough<00:01:26.740> information<00:01:27.009> to

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
not necessarily enough information to

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.039 
not necessarily enough information to
figure<00:01:27.789> out<00:01:27.969> which<00:01:28.119> title<00:01:28.509> you<00:01:28.630> want<00:01:28.749> to<00:01:28.899> rip

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
figure out which title you want to rip

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.929 
figure out which title you want to rip
but<00:01:29.649> if<00:01:29.829> it's<00:01:29.950> something<00:01:30.130> like<00:01:30.249> a<00:01:30.369> movie<00:01:30.759> you

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
but if it's something like a movie you

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.609 
but if it's something like a movie you
know<00:01:30.969> how<00:01:31.210> long<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.469> know

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.270 
as you can see here I've got a few
options<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.929> I've<00:01:47.049> got<00:01:47.079> one<00:01:47.439> that's<00:01:47.679> one<00:01:48.130> hour

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
options and I've got one that's one hour

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.800 
options and I've got one that's one hour
in<00:01:48.399> six<00:01:48.700> minutes<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.210> it's<00:01:49.359> a<00:01:49.479> little<00:01:49.689> bit

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
in six minutes and it's a little bit

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.899 
in six minutes and it's a little bit
longer<00:01:49.929> because<00:01:50.200> it's<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.649> pilot<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.159> then<00:01:51.880> I

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
longer because it's the pilot and then I

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.730 
longer because it's the pilot and then I
have<00:01:52.090> another<00:01:52.299> track<00:01:52.539> that's<00:01:52.749> 45<00:01:53.200> minutes<00:01:53.530> a

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
have another track that's 45 minutes a

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.440 
have another track that's 45 minutes a
couple<00:01:54.310> of<00:01:54.429> tracks<00:01:54.609> that<00:01:54.759> are<00:01:54.850> under<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> minute

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
couple of tracks that are under a minute

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.029 
couple of tracks that are under a minute
so<00:01:55.689> we<00:01:55.780> know<00:01:55.899> those<00:01:56.109> aren't<00:01:56.350> episodes<00:01:56.859> and

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
so we know those aren't episodes and

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.580 
so we know those aren't episodes and
then<00:01:57.670> another<00:01:57.909> track<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.420> 42<00:01:58.869> minutes<00:01:59.079> so

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
then another track that's 42 minutes so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.260 
then another track that's 42 minutes so
we've<00:01:59.740> got<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.069> first<00:02:00.310> three<00:02:00.520> episodes<00:02:00.759> on

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
we've got the first three episodes on

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.080 
we've got the first three episodes on
