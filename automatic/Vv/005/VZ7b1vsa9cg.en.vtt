00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome to the eleventh 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 issue the guild wars 2 itemshop watch 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.050
 is on this news.de 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 Today we have some new products 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.200
 in the program I personally 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.389
 I think that's interesting, too 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.180
 have not looked great yet 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.080
 As always, I buy the things live here 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.029
 with you 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 We do not start with that first 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.099
 interesting things 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.840
 I hope that everything is under action 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.590
 yes that looks good, at least for the most part 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.219
 from we start with the mini 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 lions boys who came for today only 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.120
 seven days into the game 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 that is always the way it is this idea 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 behind the itemshop lately because 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 We think we had the hippo 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 the last time the miniature hippo 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 and this time it is this miniature lion 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 boy to buy for 400 games 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 In the long term, that's a pretty expensive one 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.320
 Take care of all these mini patch 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.760
 pick up 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 That's why I would put on this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 I would recommend to anyone 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.729
 increasingly you really want to have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.760
 I was or am with me now 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.409
 a miniature lion very young 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.900
 sure that I we have the saving 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.600
 also drank on these cats and 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.950
 That's why I'll show you this one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 little cute lions 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.720
 unless I get them out of here 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 and above all, you do not think you're in the way 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.880
 stands 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 now she would have to be the miniature 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 my little one is a little mine 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.320
 little lion boy or my lion 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.930
 young looks but I think really cute 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 and cuddly and that's why I was 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.990
 pretty sure this time 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 invest ten euros and among others 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.320
 these lions boys out of the whole thing 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.649
 take with you so you can now 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.470
 for 7 days in the item shop in the gemstone 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.270
 shop but there are still some 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.750
 more changes we will go in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.509
 the area of ​​fashion because here you would have 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.700
 new things find namely the decorated one 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 ruffled shirt if I'm not wrong 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.590
 would have to be new 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.629
 with those wonderful ruffles on the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.530
 Maybe some people will join them 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.730
 maybe to the people 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.330
 could be interested 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.950
 so we have the rustic matured shirt 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.140
 or the shirred shirt here something 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.870
 old fashioned with the russians here at 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.940
 collar of course and this very much 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.470
 monochromatic look the same as again in 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.700
 cherry blossoms as the cherry blossom shirt 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.140
 Here, too , when I cherry blossom 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.599
 actually had pink in memory 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.989
 Seems that the sentence is green here too 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.750
 and that would have to be if I am not 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.730
 be mistaken been the new things 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.200
 or media the pants is still one of them 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.450
 actually, a pair of pants was the one 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 could possibly stand for at least 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.819
 the case that i will start soon 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.170
 should play golf that is the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.989
 Khaki cargo pants for the people who 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.209
 are a little interested in the outfit 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.190
 should come now though 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.859
 really interesting pato 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.530
 that this dance is like the pros 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.959
 how to dance band 1 band one that is 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.780
 the important here will be even more 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.440
 countries are coming, I am already very much 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.019
 curious; excited 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.680
 I have the item now here at the 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.970
 taken 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.180
 you see it and you are learning 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.599
 dance steps with this band so me 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.569
 would have to double click so I use that 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.130
 came is build account that is the 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.810
 can you be of your character for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.250
 send others and then we'll meet 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.190
 but how about we dance here 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.419
 Six can finish this first 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 all the dancing we should probably 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.790
 do not use at the beginning 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.810
 skill7 is the credential step of the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.430
 badge step looks like this for 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.599
 the who are interested especially people 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.599
 maybe not make a weird 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.549
 but on a flat surface like me 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.989
 that just as we see the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.510
 failure step left to right 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.699
 left to right with the 8 can 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:14.129
 we are called inventory mission then looks like that 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.480
 the dance steps of the job must 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.950
 of course we now have cool music 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:24.060
 accompany and g9 is the endless 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.560
 equipment hunts a bit from the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.060
 page 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.000
 Personally, I find three pretty cool ones 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.550
 moves but it gets even better namely 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.110
 in case you are your friends 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.199
 you can animate with the elite 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.819
 select skill area would need 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.610
 I now of course a player here 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.569
 then dance with me 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 we may try that again in 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.880
 Löwenstein I'm curious if that too 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.349
 so works like this is meant 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.150
 marks a player of the spirit of 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.300
 and then he has us with the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.319
 would have to follow dance steps 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.449
 I usually do mine 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.639
 Itemshop borgers like outside of 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.289
 Lowenstein 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.430
 But now we enter the city 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.539
 and look at the whole thing in action 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.639
 or maybe strangers 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.770
 to animate them to dance now 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.699
 here 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.949
 we will probably know now 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.530
 what I do with them that is perhaps 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.169
 also the funny thing about it but we will 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.690
 now to join in animate that me 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.400
 start dancing before you start 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:28.000
 let's see I'm there too 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.669
 as I said not really sure how 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.840
 the whole thing works great 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.599
 Dance moves is a bit on one 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.969
 more oblique mostly level again by 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:47.740
 so change the send me now times 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:49.270
 our dance movement is okay with you there 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.590
 I was not quite sure whether you 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.280
 maybe if the other player 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 eventually must join stelle 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.190
 must join in or how the whole 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.539
 then expires it can still try 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:06.069
 Let's find a player here 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:12.009
 Maybe you would like to draw with the player 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:13.990
 So there is not just standing around and the 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.599
 spirit of the dance of me gets so good 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.060
 the are we would then have the individual in 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.650
 single case try it yourself if you 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.610
 that with this spirit of dance 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:28.240
 he has got here now i believe 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:31.940
 a name to dance 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.590
 He has this question now he uses him 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.220
 also that I think then you have to 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.890
 apparently self-employed as a player 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.770
 join in and then dance on the spot 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.280
 and that was the itemshop watch on this one 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.850
 part 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.230
 There were three new nice things for me 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.120
 a few equipment especially, finally 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.790
 my pants i personally have is very much 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.030
 very little pants seen of the miniature 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.070
 lion cub and how to dance band 1 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.560
 We can also look forward to band 2 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.170
 and possibly further following volumes 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.790
 his thinking is to subscribe to hans 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:09.160
 and we hear and see each other again 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.160
 next video until then much fun
