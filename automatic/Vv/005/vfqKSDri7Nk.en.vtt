magazine that's been around I think for

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.660 
magazine that's been around I think for
115<00:03:44.310> years<00:03:44.609> and<00:03:44.880> has<00:03:45.239> only<00:03:45.450> had<00:03:45.810> four

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
115 years and has only had four

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.650 
115 years and has only had four
african-americans<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.819> its<00:03:47.970> cover<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.450> all

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
that time and LeBron James is the first

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.120 
that time and LeBron James is the first
black<00:03:51.299> man<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.900> on<00:03:51.989> its<00:03:52.139> cover<00:03:52.350> yeah<00:03:52.980> it

he's a very low-key guy I will show you
a<00:05:13.370> hundred<00:05:13.669> images<00:05:13.940> from<00:05:14.270> Sports<00:05:14.569> Illustrated

a hundred images from Sports Illustrated

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.170 
a hundred images from Sports Illustrated
where<00:05:15.289> that's<00:05:15.530> LeBron<00:05:15.979> of<00:05:16.430> course<00:05:16.729> he's<00:05:17.150> been

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
where that's LeBron of course he's been

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.210 
where that's LeBron of course he's been
that<00:05:17.599> honest<00:05:18.199> those<00:05:18.440> but<00:05:18.710> there<00:05:18.860> were<00:05:18.979> other

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
that honest those but there were other

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.219 
that honest those but there were other
pictures<00:05:19.940> that<00:05:20.180> they<00:05:20.330> could<00:05:20.569> have<00:05:20.659> chosen<00:05:20.930> so

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
pictures that they could have chosen so

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:22.990 
pictures that they could have chosen so
of<00:05:21.319> course<00:05:21.530> that<00:05:21.650> make<00:05:22.009> basically<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.610> magazine

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
of course that make basically a magazine

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.120 
of course that make basically a magazine
I<00:05:23.330> think<00:05:23.599> that<00:05:23.720> had<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.900> most<00:05:24.110> energy<00:05:24.800> in<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.099> I

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
I think that had the most energy in it I

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.559 
I think that had the most energy in it I
don't<00:05:25.699> think<00:05:25.909> it<00:05:25.970> was<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.120> black-white<00:05:26.539> issue

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
don't think it was a black-white issue

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.510 
don't think it was a black-white issue
one<00:05:26.960> man<00:05:27.169> energy<00:05:27.770> can<00:05:27.979> be<00:05:28.099> another<00:05:28.370> as

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
one man energy can be another as

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.279 
one man energy can be another as
offensive<00:05:29.090> but<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.360> think<00:05:29.630> that's<00:05:29.780> also<00:05:30.139> what

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
offensive but I think that's also what

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:31.540 
offensive but I think that's also what
great<00:05:30.469> art<00:05:30.710> does<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.130> fact<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.400> we're

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
great art does the fact that we're

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.010 
great art does the fact that we're
having<00:05:31.580> this<00:05:32.000> discussion<00:05:32.449> I'm<00:05:32.719> going<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.930> say

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
having this discussion I'm going to say

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.719 
having this discussion I'm going to say
I<00:05:33.199> do<00:05:33.500> not<00:05:33.650> believe<00:05:34.099> that<00:05:34.159> people<00:05:34.490> have<00:05:34.580> all

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
I do not believe that people have all

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.480 
I do not believe that people have all
kind<00:05:34.969> of<00:05:35.000> any<00:05:35.300> intention<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:36.190> having<00:05:37.190> said

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
kind of any intention of having said

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.950 
kind of any intention of having said
that<00:05:37.520> though<00:05:37.820> but<00:05:38.120> are<00:05:38.419> they<00:05:38.570> having<00:05:38.900> this

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
that though but are they having this

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.379 
that though but are they having this
discussion<00:05:39.349> means<00:05:40.130> that's<00:05:40.820> great<00:05:41.150> mark

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
discussion means that's great mark

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.510 
discussion means that's great mark
because<00:05:41.599> we<00:05:41.719> intended<00:05:42.590> like<00:05:42.740> awareness<00:05:43.370> are

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
because we intended like awareness are

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.360 
because we intended like awareness are
two<00:05:43.669> different<00:05:43.969> things<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:45.159> what<00:05:46.159> is<00:05:46.250> the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
two different things so what is the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.740 
two different things so what is the
awareness<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.880> you<00:05:47.030> want<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.419> say<00:05:47.570> this

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
awareness that you want to say this

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.570 
awareness that you want to say this

public eye who are putting these images

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.379 
public eye who are putting these images
out<00:05:51.889> should<00:05:52.190> be<00:05:52.310> thinking<00:05:52.699> about<00:05:52.789> well<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.210> have

to<00:05:53.509> go<00:05:53.630> back<00:05:53.750> to<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.050> point<00:05:54.289> even<00:05:54.650> though<00:05:54.740> a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
to go back to the point even though a

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.409 
to go back to the point even though a
lot<00:05:54.830> of<00:05:54.979> people<00:05:55.159> don't<00:05:55.669> know<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:55.969> vogue

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
hasn't had like so much integration and

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.159 
hasn't had like so much integration and
their<00:05:58.550> covers<00:05:58.909> because<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.419> think<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.750> numbers

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
their covers because I think a numbers
