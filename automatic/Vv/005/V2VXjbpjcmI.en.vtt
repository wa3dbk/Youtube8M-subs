as<00:02:32.810> well<00:02:33.650> also<00:02:34.340> most<00:02:34.519> people<00:02:34.700> were<00:02:35.000> confused

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
as well also most people were confused

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.140 
as well also most people were confused
about<00:02:35.629> how<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.019> actually<00:02:36.230> pronounced<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.700> think

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
about how to actually pronounced I think

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.280 
about how to actually pronounced I think
it's<00:02:38.329> like<00:02:38.510> Super<00:02:39.440> Saiyan<00:02:40.060> God<00:02:41.060> Super<00:02:41.290> Saiyan

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
it's like Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.899 
it's like Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan
I<00:02:42.560> think<00:02:42.829> that's<00:02:43.010> how<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.129> pronounce<00:02:43.250> Super

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
I think that's how you pronounce Super

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.599 
I think that's how you pronounce Super
Saiyan<00:02:44.120> God<00:02:44.269> Super<00:02:44.329> saying<00:02:45.190> that's<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.310> only

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
Saiyan God Super saying that's the only

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.759 
Saiyan God Super saying that's the only
thing<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.090> can<00:02:47.150> imagine<00:02:48.019> how<00:02:48.409> you're<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.680> to
