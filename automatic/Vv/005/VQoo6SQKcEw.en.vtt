00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.460
 song is going to be the title of the album is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 the best album in the world is not a 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.239
 song is not to live but to die 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.199
 quiet medium to leave a trace 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.570
 we have given everything there are Russian musicians 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.410
 Serbs of all good there are more than 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 four hundred people who have 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.710
 collaborated and from Barcelona we 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.309
 generated sergio and his team since it is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 and this has been a very long life many 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.190
 sleepless nights 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.900
 you really want a lot of nerve and a lot 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.229
 concentration to go to the pot 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.420
 and deviate from the positive because a disc 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.220
 positive inside the disk you will see the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 proof of all those who have recorded in 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.440
 serbia the best russian saxophonist all 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.820

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.100
 let's go we're a chorus that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 already went around the world because it was a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.140
 star with the video rafael soler the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.090
 cartoon creator of willy fox 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.380

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 caught chorus we have put a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.149
 sociable verse that are positive 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.560
 for people to be encouraged and in these 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.149
 times where there are many people 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 she cries she has always cried now yes 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.080

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 At least get a smile from those who

 that he has taken out by the title that he puts 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 if this nordic of the insurmountable world does not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.229
 you can be better and point is the best 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.869
 is Canarian musicians are please 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.229
 try to be with these names not 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.179
 They are rare 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.730
 like what that 's called Russian florist 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.810
 it's the most cars all the cars 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.640
 Dollars 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.090
 and those who play gave names of the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 Russian Perez Perez 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.620
 the names for example if the demand 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.470
 he could not put them 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.030
 because impossible now is that now 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.950
 I can be that I take a street one they were 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.390

 the grand jury is the one who listens to it 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.099
 what is clear is that we have 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.870
 worked with more impossible love the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.170
 musicians with this title have turned 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.819

 May that what we want is firstly 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.989

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.370

 we escape we have food the refrigerator and 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.700
 we eat we're going to think about ourselves 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.530
 in making them rich because we are already rich 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.579
 because we have food because right now 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.470
 whoever has food and a little 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.359
 freedom can already be rich looking at the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.330
 life with philosophy truth because there is no 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.570
 work 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.970
 tears is to be positive today is a luxury 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.530
 because it is a luxury according to eduardo 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.840
 prescribed to the design of the projects 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.280
 positive all work because there is no 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.570
 there is no then we do not have 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.910
 no competition right now there's no 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.610
 the groups that are releasing records with 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.650
 wanting to be and make happy the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.360
 people have had many moments of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.670
 success throughout your life and more with 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.470
 these seven discs hope that this new 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.240
 disc also have the smash that they have 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.590
 had the others not no if the title says 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.130
 the best album in the world of all there is no 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.220
 there is no 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.320
 yesterday for example he went back to when you 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.870
 You take out an album you pass through a lot of 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.940
 places to be heard experts do not 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.040
 and the topics that there are as one likes 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.630
 this other likes the other with the musicians 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.370
 for example the Russians and Serbs when 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.100
 they arrive they recorded there they brought it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.010
 for here and the musicians said no who 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.650
 plays and not the beast musicians those of 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.450
 here then the same thing and then that title the 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.920
 people have laughed a lot because it says there 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.620
 have what we have with a title 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.880
 but of course you also have to try 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.860
 have the least possible errors for 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.470
 that does not give us much cane but always 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.820
 there will always be a rod but the music 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.820
 what's there when they listen to the record is 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.650
 and other types of topics we will find 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.230
 on this album because there will be music from 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.080
 love now music mixed with I do not know that 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.020
 there will be this style of music so if 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.440
 wants to speak against something if everything 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.520
 all different 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520
 888 888 1 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.650
 that mix a little bit of cultures and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.180
 then I tell you that there is in this disc 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.250
 one way or another they collaborate more than 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.030
 four people and within the 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.730
 disc is all well explained all how 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.430
 it was done where it was made because it was made 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.480
 they all sang a little a cappella 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.480
 some disk 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.220
 I have the guitar 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.439
 empathic 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:51.659
 and even that a little bit once a 

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:51.659
 is different 

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:59.919
 what madness madness what madness is love 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.299
 nonsense that is made when you lose 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.269
 the reason 

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:07.449
 what madness what madness what madness is the 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:11.699
 love nonsense that are made when 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.699
 you lose the reason there is love 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.739
 santana the best apology
