for<00:00:00.450> decades<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:01.230> subway<00:00:01.709> has<00:00:01.949> been<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.520> way

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
for decades the subway has been the way

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.420 
for decades the subway has been the way
to<00:00:02.850> commute<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.449> New<00:00:03.600> York<00:00:03.810> City<00:00:04.170> 54%<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
to commute in New York City 54% of

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.849 
to commute in New York City 54% of
residents<00:00:05.940> use<00:00:06.240> it<00:00:06.420> every<00:00:06.750> day<00:00:06.779> but<00:00:07.740> as

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
residents use it every day but as

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.400 
residents use it every day but as
ridership<00:00:08.309> increases<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.750> have<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> delays

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
ridership increases so have the delays

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.940 
ridership increases so have the delays
and<00:00:10.440> fares<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.719> we<00:00:12.719> wondered<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.679> subway

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
and fares so we wondered is the subway

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890 
and fares so we wondered is the subway
still<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.700> best<00:00:14.910> way<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> get<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.540> work

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
still the best way to get to work

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.570 
still the best way to get to work

so how did everyone do the ferry is

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
so how did everyone do the ferry is
beautiful<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.450> relaxing<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.500> limited

it from being a serious contender for

it from being a serious contender for
now<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.930> taxi<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.470> cheaper<00:02:56.890> than<00:02:56.920> uber<00:02:57.400> but

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
now the taxi was cheaper than uber but

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.460 
now the taxi was cheaper than uber but
it<00:02:57.730> suffers<00:02:58.120> from<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.390> lack<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.600> apps<00:02:59.080> which<00:02:59.440> is

it suffers from a lack of apps which is

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.470 
it suffers from a lack of apps which is
especially<00:03:00.130> problematic<00:03:00.640> in<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.330> outer

boroughs uber was fast comfortable and
had<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.630> best<00:03:04.750> app<00:03:05.080> but<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.530> loses<00:03:05.740> points<00:03:06.160> for

the new uber pool option could change

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.200 
the new uber pool option could change
