00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the same time and then and then around

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.780 
dude but I like about Adam Sandler the
most<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.040> has<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.280> group<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> guys

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
most is that he has this group of guys

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.460 
most is that he has this group of guys
that<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.450> friends<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.409> like

that are just as friends that are like

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
that are just as friends that are like
in<00:01:49.829> every<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.310> his<00:01:50.460> movies<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:51.420> are

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
in every one of his movies they are

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.910 
in every one of his movies they are
writing<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.259> movies<00:01:52.530> together<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

I think that's really cool there even

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.690

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
those kind of movies and maybe we just

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.680 
those kind of movies and maybe we just
look<00:02:44.520> at<00:02:44.640> mr.<00:02:44.880> deeds<00:02:45.120> or<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> chuck<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.660> Larry

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
look at mr. deeds or a chuck and Larry

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.390 
look at mr. deeds or a chuck and Larry
we're<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.290> looks<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.680> garbage<00:02:47.160> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
we're like that looks like garbage and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.160 
we're like that looks like garbage and
it's<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:48.060> garbagey<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.720> Billy<00:02:49.050> Madison

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
it's really as garbagey as Billy Madison

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.720 
it's really as garbagey as Billy Madison
would've<00:02:49.560> been<00:02:49.650> yeah<00:02:49.950> perhaps<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.520> mean<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
would've been yeah perhaps I mean I

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.700 
would've been yeah perhaps I mean I
haven't<00:02:51.150> watched<00:02:51.360> Billy<00:02:51.630> Madison<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.530> while

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
haven't watched Billy Madison in a while

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.350 
haven't watched Billy Madison in a while

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I watched have to Gilmore I think I'd be

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.660 
I watched have to Gilmore I think I'd be
one<00:02:54.450> worth<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.630> better<00:02:54.750> movie<00:02:55.400> every<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.520> often

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
one worth a better movie every so often

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.480 
one worth a better movie every so often
when<00:02:56.820> it's<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.000> TV<00:02:57.150> or<00:02:57.300> whatever<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:58.400> don't<00:02:59.400> know

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.010 
when it's on TV or whatever I don't know
I<00:02:59.520> I<00:02:59.700> think<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.720> about<00:03:00.840> his

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.880 
I I think that what I like about his
movies<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.440> they<00:03:01.590> all<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.860> same

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
movies is that they all have the same

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.080 
movies is that they all have the same
tone<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:03.050> it's<00:03:04.050> stupid<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.400> stupid

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090

think that their movies are just dumb I
mean<00:04:00.270> think<00:04:00.450> about<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.660> movie<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.930> he<00:04:01.140> wasn't

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
mean think about a movie that he wasn't

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.199 
mean think about a movie that he wasn't
in<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:01.770> that<00:04:01.920> he<00:04:02.190> had<00:04:02.400> something<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.150> with

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
in but that he had something to do with

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.490 
in but that he had something to do with
in<00:04:03.360> terms<00:04:03.570> of<00:04:03.690> his<00:04:03.810> production<00:04:04.170> company<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
in terms of his production company and

good example like when was until I got

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.100
