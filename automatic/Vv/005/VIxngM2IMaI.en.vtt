a<00:01:03.250> lot<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:03.519> people<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.989> it's<00:01:05.170> pretty<00:01:05.379> basic

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979

I'll<00:01:06.580> go<00:01:06.759> into<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.150> little<00:01:07.300> bit<00:01:07.420> more<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.780> just

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
I'll go into it a little bit more I just

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.930 
I'll go into it a little bit more I just
going<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.350> show<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.619> vacuum<00:01:09.009> lines<00:01:09.220> but<00:01:09.550> I'm

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
going to show the vacuum lines but I'm

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.430 
going to show the vacuum lines but I'm
out<00:01:10.090> here<00:01:10.270> freezing<00:01:10.540> anyway<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.050> I<00:01:11.229> might<00:01:11.259> as

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
out here freezing anyway so I might as

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.230 
out here freezing anyway so I might as
well<00:01:11.500> go<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:13.659> you<00:01:13.720> have<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.869> fuel<00:01:14.110> line

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
well go into it so you have a fuel line

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.900 
well go into it so you have a fuel line
there<00:01:16.240> ends<00:01:16.509> in<00:01:16.600> your<00:01:16.750> carburetor<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:18.490> mixes

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
there ends in your carburetor it mixes

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.040 
there ends in your carburetor it mixes
it

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it
ah

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.160 

you<00:01:24.610> give<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> gas<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.960> course<00:01:27.870> you<00:01:28.870> get<00:01:28.990> more

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
you give a gas of course you get more

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.510 
you give a gas of course you get more
fuel<00:01:29.380> kicking<00:01:29.800> through<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.070> which<00:01:30.220> makes<00:01:30.370> your

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
fuel kicking through it which makes your

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.090 
fuel kicking through it which makes your
car<00:01:30.670> run<00:01:30.880> faster<00:01:31.330> actually<00:01:32.080> it's<00:01:32.170> more<00:01:32.290> air<00:01:32.500> it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
car run faster actually it's more air it

car run faster actually it's more air it
kind<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.400> operates<00:01:33.729> like<00:01:33.880> an<00:01:34.000> air<00:01:34.150> pump<00:01:34.380> except

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:24.769 
an oil pump which is the exact same time
drives<00:06:21.629> this<00:06:21.779> year<00:06:23.269> well<00:06:24.269> not<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.509> oil<00:06:24.689> pump

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:24.779 
drives this year well not the oil pump

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.670 
drives this year well not the oil pump
itself<00:06:25.169> but<00:06:25.499> so<00:06:26.339> that<00:06:26.669> turns<00:06:26.939> which<00:06:27.419> turns<00:06:27.719> the

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
itself but so that turns which turns the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.240 
itself but so that turns which turns the
distributor<00:06:30.669> makes<00:06:31.509> the<00:06:31.630> distributor<00:06:32.250> rotor

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
distributor makes the distributor rotor

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.730 
distributor makes the distributor rotor
turn<00:06:33.550> inside<00:06:34.139> so<00:06:35.139> everything<00:06:35.470> has<00:06:35.590> to<00:06:35.710> be

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
turn inside so everything has to be

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.770 
turn inside so everything has to be
timed<00:06:36.039> properly<00:06:36.449> because<00:06:37.449> you<00:06:37.600> want<00:06:37.750> your

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
timed properly because you want your

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.830 
timed properly because you want your
piss<00:06:38.020> in<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.229> top<00:06:38.440> dead<00:06:38.650> center<00:06:39.690> when<00:06:40.690> the

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
piss in the top dead center when the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.650 
piss in the top dead center when the
router<00:06:41.400> touches<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:42.610> metal<00:06:42.940> prong<00:06:43.360> inside

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
router touches the metal prong inside

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.330 
router touches the metal prong inside
the<00:06:43.780> cap<00:06:43.990> which<00:06:44.320> sends<00:06:44.590> a<00:06:44.650> spark<00:06:44.949> down<00:06:45.190> the

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
the cap which sends a spark down the

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.370 
the cap which sends a spark down the
plug<00:06:45.610> to<00:06:46.210> the<00:06:46.240> plug<00:06:46.479> wire<00:06:46.750> which<00:06:46.900> exposed<00:06:47.259> on

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
plug to the plug wire which exposed on

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.439 
plug to the plug wire which exposed on
top<00:06:47.560> of<00:06:47.740> piston<00:06:48.100> which<00:06:48.669> turns<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.120> pushes<00:06:49.360> the

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
top of piston which turns and pushes the

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.779 
top of piston which turns and pushes the
next<00:06:49.720> one<00:06:49.900> up<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.289> so<00:06:50.979> on<00:06:51.130> and<00:06:51.310> so<00:06:51.430> on<00:06:51.520> and<00:06:51.759> so

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
next one up and so on and so on and so

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.189 
next one up and so on and so on and so
on<00:06:51.970> that's<00:06:52.270> how<00:06:52.360> you're<00:06:52.479> cringing<00:06:52.600> constantly

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
on that's how you're cringing constantly

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:56.550 
on that's how you're cringing constantly
turns<00:06:54.330> so<00:06:55.330> if<00:06:55.449> your<00:06:55.570> engines<00:06:55.810> constantly<00:06:56.320> turn

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 
turns so if your engines constantly turn

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.529 
turns so if your engines constantly turn
in<00:06:56.680> a<00:06:56.800> fire<00:06:57.039> and<00:06:57.310> well<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:58.180> your<00:06:58.360> carburetor

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:58.539 
in a fire and well and your carburetor

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.529 
in a fire and well and your carburetor
is<00:06:58.870> mixing<00:06:59.199> the<00:06:59.320> gas<00:06:59.940> to<00:07:00.940> the<00:07:01.030> right<00:07:01.180> mixture

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
is mixing the gas to the right mixture

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.240 
is mixing the gas to the right mixture
and<00:07:01.870> letting<00:07:02.199> enough<00:07:02.410> in<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.889> have<00:07:03.099> the

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
and letting enough in and have the

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.580 
and letting enough in and have the
proper<00:07:03.580> feed<00:07:03.820> to<00:07:04.090> it<00:07:04.270> your<00:07:04.960> cars<00:07:05.139> going<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.380> run

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
proper feed to it your cars going to run

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.499 
proper feed to it your cars going to run
on<00:07:05.710> right<00:07:05.919> everything<00:07:06.520> after<00:07:06.639> that's<00:07:06.970> tuning

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
on right everything after that's tuning

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.749 
on right everything after that's tuning
now<00:07:08.080> like<00:07:08.800> I<00:07:08.889> said<00:07:08.919> I<00:07:09.130> made<00:07:09.370> this<00:07:09.490> video

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
now like I said I made this video

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.640 
now like I said I made this video
because<00:07:10.000> I<00:07:10.180> had<00:07:10.330> some<00:07:10.570> questions<00:07:10.720> come<00:07:11.259> in<00:07:11.289> and

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
because I had some questions come in and

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.659 
because I had some questions come in and
I've<00:07:11.770> been<00:07:11.860> talking<00:07:12.009> about<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:12.280> couple<00:07:12.520> people

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
I've been talking about a couple people

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.480 
I've been talking about a couple people
had<00:07:12.910> questions<00:07:13.090> on<00:07:13.509> this<00:07:13.660> and<00:07:13.870> that<00:07:14.020> so<00:07:14.199> I<00:07:14.560> have

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
had questions on this and that so I have

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.370 
had questions on this and that so I have
another<00:07:15.729> video<00:07:15.940> actually<00:07:16.570> a<00:07:16.780> three<00:07:16.960> part<00:07:17.169> and

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
another video actually a three part and

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.890 
another video actually a three part and
how<00:07:17.440> to<00:07:17.500> set<00:07:17.770> your<00:07:17.919> timing<00:07:18.449> so<00:07:19.449> i<00:07:19.479> hope<00:07:19.720> this

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
how to set your timing so i hope this

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.260 
how to set your timing so i hope this
clear<00:07:20.229> clarifies<00:07:20.919> a<00:07:20.949> couple<00:07:21.430> things<00:07:21.610> that<00:07:22.000> I

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.270 
clear clarifies a couple things that I
