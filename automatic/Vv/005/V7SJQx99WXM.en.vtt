firewall<00:01:13.910> it<00:01:14.910> was<00:01:15.120> I<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.290> Chloe<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.740> McAfee

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
firewall it was I was a Chloe and McAfee

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
firewall it was I was a Chloe and McAfee
I<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.730> I<00:01:18.000> had<00:01:18.870> McAfee<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:21.570> time<00:01:21.810> had

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I think I had McAfee and it the time had

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
I think I had McAfee and it the time had
run<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.230> and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.520> wasn't<00:01:23.700> working<00:01:23.970> no<00:01:24.270> longer

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
run out and it wasn't working no longer

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.090 
run out and it wasn't working no longer
but<00:01:24.660> I<00:01:24.750> thought<00:01:24.960> maybe<00:01:25.230> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.740> problem

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
but I thought maybe this is the problem

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
but I thought maybe this is the problem
so<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.310> I'm<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.850> old<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> fee<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.870> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so I I'm just old back a fee and it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
search some more and it seems like

always<00:03:21.390> duplicates<00:03:22.079> itself<00:03:23.329> but<00:03:24.329> basically

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
always duplicates itself but basically

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.400 
always duplicates itself but basically
what<00:03:24.870> happened<00:03:25.290> when<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.829> first<00:03:26.190> found<00:03:26.489> this

what happened when I first found this

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.620 
what happened when I first found this
everything<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.680> these<00:03:29.579> boxes<00:03:30.120> what<00:03:30.269> was

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
everything this these boxes what was

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.349 
everything this these boxes what was
ticked<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.709> basically<00:03:32.220> prevents<00:03:32.730> Team

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.330 
servers so what you need to do is you
need<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.329> take<00:03:39.570> out<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:40.109> button<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.829> this

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
need to take out this button and this

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.630 
need to take out this button and this
button<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.030> in<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.500> can't<00:03:44.100> click<00:03:44.430> off

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640

all<00:03:44.940> of<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> buttons<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.690> think<00:03:46.140> that's

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
all of the buttons I think that's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.030 
all of the buttons I think that's
impossible<00:03:46.950> at<00:03:47.790> least<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.180> can't<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.890> need

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
impossible at least I can't but you need

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.990 
impossible at least I can't but you need
to<00:03:50.130> keep<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:52.130> public<00:03:53.130> which<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.579> what<00:03:53.730> says

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
to keep a public which is what says

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.120 
to keep a public which is what says
right<00:03:54.329> here<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:55.739> need<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.010> keep<00:03:56.269> public<00:03:57.269> off

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
right here you need to keep public off

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.949 
right here you need to keep public off
like<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.940> keep<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:00.780> if

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
like on you can keep that on so if

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.199 
like on you can keep that on so if
you're<00:04:01.079> on<00:04:01.260> an<00:04:01.640> airport<00:04:02.640> or<00:04:02.790> something<00:04:02.850> you

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
you're on an airport or something you

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.390 
you're on an airport or something you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
this is home network and you need to key
