00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.790
 fruit of the synthesis between brush 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.600
 the one from jÃ¡vea 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.300
 a new concept of machines is born 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.419
 the indicator brush 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:13.119
 designed for those jobs where the use of a sander is insufficient and 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.080
 using a brush is not suitable 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.080
 given the nature of the materials 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.179
 with a work system similar to that of a conventional brush incorporated in 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.119
 place of knives a long lasting abrasive roller 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.360
 although it may seem that the roller will wear out quickly 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
 his work system does not allow it at all 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.820
 to brush a millimeter involved more than 20 aggressive milligrams 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.360
 so the work of each summer is only 3 thousand cases 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.379
 also 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.100
 the enormous centrifugal force generated by the 16,500 minute revolution of the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 roller 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.300
 indicates that the extracted material if it starts to analyze 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.700
 so its wear is minimal and its superior performance and more economical 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 that a set of knives of a conventional brush 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.230
 Likewise 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.830
 the roller rotates in the forward direction 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.040
 so the powder is directly led to the suction torera 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.509
 The range of dictator brushes consists of two models 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.230
 the ceeg 23 that in him 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.350
 from Barcelona 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.500
 miguel c 123 n adjustable base curve 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 for curved surfaces 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.550
 there are many possible applications of this new generation of machines 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.820
 next we will see some of the most significant where the brush 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.050
 picador shows some outstanding attitudes 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.900
 It is ideal for low resource settings 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.579
 there is no risk of suffocating humanity 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.579
 although we work with contractors 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 the shelf settings sing to two are performed quickly and accurately 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.219
 and without risks of asphyxia of the panel from the outside as in the championship 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.420
 your ability to brush lizardo 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.630
 this exceptional for a system with abrasive material 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.549
 allow brush and paste one millimeter deep in a single pass 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.739
 It is very versatile in its handling 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.819
 allowing to work on materials with confidence and precision 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.519
 having no blades suso on surfaces is not so aggressive 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.239
 but nevertheless 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.150
 It has a high level of material extraction 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.390
 also allowing its lightness 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.609
 handle it with one hand 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.199
 Its brush structure allows you to brush it polycarp only thickness 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.329
 adjusted in the front garden 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.389
 when the machine rests on the back 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.189
 A) Yes 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.609

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.789
 and with precision 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.979
 The extraction of paints and varnishes is an application where the brush 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 dictator demonstrates exceptional effectiveness 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.379
 in this case the extraction of a deteriorated exterior varnish is carried out 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.379
 for the subsequent rehabilitation of the piece 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.879
 the result obtained in a very short time 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
 it's amazing 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.359
 it even starts 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.139
 with several layers of paint and varnish 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.639
 one over the other over the years 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.559
 the heat brush demonstrates its great extraction capacity 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.559
 and recovery of the piece 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.419
 check how the rinsing roller is kept clean of paint residues and 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.229
 varnish 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:48.509
 the brushing of the edges is carried out without fear splintering the mother 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:49.880
 and also allows 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.639
 give it a different finish 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 given the ease of modeling the piece 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.080
 in the conventional corridors 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.660
 Finding a nail or staple hidden in the wood can damage the blades and 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.019
 even the portal 'cars days 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.789
 the brush they left instead 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:12.099
 john work without fear of finding the metallic elements 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.879
 because these 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.879
 Do not damage the roller or the machine 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.729
 simply the metal parts that we can find will be in past 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 on the worked surface 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.409
 the brush readers 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.400
 It is ideal for removing paints of all kinds 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 getting a high school level if the brands 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.090
 their ability to extract these children was eliminated even 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.400
 hard coatings 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.669
 as in the psychic 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.669
 either on the surface or on the edge 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.870
 the way the heat roller acts 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.610
 allows brushing surfaces formed of materials of different nature 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.710
 in the image we see when brushing on a polystyrene wooden surface 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.870
 the result is a smooth surface 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.030
 with all the materials perfectly integrated 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.739
 being possible also brushed the angle without fear of damaging the 

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:27.739
 more brittle and fragile materials 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.659

 in a few seconds and without the need for tools 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.940
 The type of roller is easily identifiable thanks to the band of 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.860
 color that incorporates the adjustment of the base is also very simple through the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.300
 front knob we will adjust the thickness of the pass in the same way as 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.979
 we would act with a conventional brush 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.070
 we must adjust the back 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.610
 according to the robinho team that we place 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.520
 so that the same thing will happen 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.419
 clemente respectively flush
