00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:04.240
 voodoo 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.890
 me 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.890
 Hmm 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:29.680
 I made a live jacket 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.680
 Recently, self- inflating life jackets have become mainstream, though 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.840
 After all Toka little not force secure when they do what the winter of boat 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.560
 Something 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.530
 Sometimes happened 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.440
 The type with old-fashioned Yuyu buoy is better 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 Well 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.930
 It's a sense of security 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 thing I said 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.120
 Unexpectedly it will be cold measures 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 I tried 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.739
 that 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.170
 However, if you focus on design too much, you can not secure a buoyant body 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.430
 Go hard 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.730
 Only of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 Old put the body 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.820
 Tan yet suitable for fishing 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820
 By say 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.439
 As a design feature 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.810
 It's side, let's go with the zipper 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 Opening the Pasona 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 size is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.990
 If you should hear go 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.230
 further 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.910
 Say this 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.910
 Tome mustard Toka or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.609
 One more pattern 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.880
 Here and here is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:02.000
 In such a feeling there are fine adjustments in four stages 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.680
 Um in line at the rod that it here? Types do that Natick bell head is with this 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.280
 Is low 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:16.200
 Outside N as simple as possible in the competition troublesome fire 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.200
 But I adopt this kind of path formula that can be adjusted again 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.920
 Well it is not only this side but this part 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.920
 Fasteners on shoulders 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.050
 Does not happen 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.040
 If you can 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.970
 I wore that winter clothes 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.740
 Or bitter 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.940
 When possible 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.600
 Body fit 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.600
 Like you can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.230
 It is shaped 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.230
 plate 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.840
 Also inside 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.840
 eh 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.900
 I'm betting 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.590
 It narrows down with this 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.580
 Squeezing or loosening now 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580
 Adjust by doing 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.879
 Back cloth is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.879
 mesh 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.689
 Someday I wonder what this part is like 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.150
 I'm going to feel nice 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.140
 Also to see the purpose 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.520
 There is a touch 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.310
 Pooh
