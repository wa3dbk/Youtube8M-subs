00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello very good everyone I'm sp 26 and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.390
 welcome to this new tutorial in the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.419
 I want to teach how to close programs 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.040
 that they are left not close the deal this 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.340
 it's a fairly common error in 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.110
 windows is good and the solution is very 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 simple according surely when 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.970
 I feel you already know more or 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.920
 less how are the shots going about this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.530
 tutorial but there will be many people 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.080
 also that I do not know the steps that I'm going 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 to treat the Columbian below and 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.720
 nothing this mistake and I tell you can 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.880
 be people 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.490
 we are not working with the program and 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.410
 others and suddenly it does not answer the 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 program of it and the worst of all is 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.200
 that does not allow us to close the conseller 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.450
 how the program worked the only way 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.300
 to solve it at least that I 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.950
 know that even the simplest is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.170
 the one that I'm going to teach next 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.399
 a screen are appearing or have 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.750
 already appeared messages and alerts from 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.150
 different situations where you do not 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.130
 Skip that failure 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.650
 and well let's proceed to what is 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.320
 close this program to the teacher who 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.470
 sometime then I fail of these and it tells me 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.830
 do not discount so let's proceed to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.050
 close it but not giving lara x 5 agreement 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.930
 because we already know what happens this problem 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.720
 if you give the X in agreement now 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.880
 same yes because we are not simulating that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.450
 problem since I would have to thank 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 used and others but well let's see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.010
 how we close it resolutely what can we 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.380
 do two ways in windows 7 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.390
 we go here to the bar 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.200
 Taskbar tools let you 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200
 to give the right button 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.210
 we can give you in start administrator 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.840
 of tasks we send to the shout and not 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.929
 I would skip this 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.030
 and here are all the processes worth in 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.880
 all the programs that we have open 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 in that case as we see we have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.000
 in singing he is obviously washing and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.990
 the photoshop that if you were to close 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.590
 here is also the whole list of 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.519
 processes that we have open 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.160
 here I recommend that you do not close the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.930
 processes into action because there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.420
 many processes such as explore and others 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.830
 what are the desk 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.450
 and if we close it then it is possible that 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.940
 the valencianista computer turns off 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.280
 any story is worth it so 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.620
 I recommend looking for a test 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.580
 end a process of an application 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.800
 that was alerted let's look at what 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.690
 Applications 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.370
 in this case as it is a program that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 we have open at the end when it goes to 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 appear here in applications 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.450
 but as you can see I have many others 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.270
 programs that do not appear in 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 applications like for example the bar 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.190
 net supplying maquila barral and its 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.030
 applications in processes that appear 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.010
 as we see there were applications 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.180
 so we do not have to play a game 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.470
 little bit with that is a wall in 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.260
 applications of our martyr to 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.660
 look for it in courage processes and already 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.980
 you can like and select the help 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.659
 has finished the process 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.940
 in this case we have it here in 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.860
 photoshop in applications we will give 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.860
 at the end of late automatically 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.270
 in the same way we can go here to 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.640
 processes look for photoshop here what 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.960
 we have and we close it in the same way 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.520
 we give at the end of the process as you see it is 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.700
 pretty simple to solve the 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.910
 problem although I guess a lot of 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.960
 you would not know which one you would have 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.620
 this one in this little 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.620
 although others, yes 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.790
 this would solve the problem of 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.890
 program error 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.080
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.720
 it's like that to leave it in the comments of 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.400
 way not to start this tutorial and so on 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.540
 and if it has served you 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.050
 obviously the tutorial as I said 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.639
 a disc with extended greetings to all 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.449
 bye 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.449
 I make
