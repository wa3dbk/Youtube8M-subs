00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.670

standards<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.400> economic<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> business<00:01:09.680> in

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
standards of of economic and business in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680 
standards of of economic and business in
Business<00:01:11.130> College<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.180> regret

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
Business College and they don't regret

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.170 
Business College and they don't regret
it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.630 

I<00:01:22.340> think<00:01:23.360> knowing<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:25.130> draw<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
I think knowing how to draw and how to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
I think knowing how to draw and how to
paint<00:01:27.030> always<00:01:27.510> helps<00:01:27.960> painting<00:01:28.860> helps

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
paint always helps painting helps

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.290 
paint always helps painting helps
because<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.660> paint<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.200> learn<00:01:31.440> how<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
because when you paint you learn how to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.900 
because when you paint you learn how to
how<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.330> play<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.960> colors<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.670> learn

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
how to play with colors you you learn

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.540 
how to play with colors you you learn
composition<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.590> very<00:01:37.830> important<00:01:38.370> for

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
composition which is very important for

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.969 
composition which is very important for
any<00:01:38.760> artwork<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.600> photography<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.470> digital

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
any artwork like photography or digital

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.920 
any artwork like photography or digital
art<00:01:41.190> but<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.330> all<00:01:42.570> these<00:01:42.720> new

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
art but because of all these new

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.469 
art but because of all these new
technologies<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.160> like<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.640> combine<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
technologies I really like to combine it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.700 
technologies I really like to combine it

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
and make new rules and make new kind of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.700 
and make new rules and make new kind of
work<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> haven't<00:01:50.460> been<00:01:50.520> done<00:01:50.760> before

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.969 

you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979

well<00:02:05.979> all<00:02:06.220> art<00:02:06.580> is<00:02:06.820> an<00:02:07.060> illusion<00:02:07.780> basically

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
well all art is an illusion basically

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.150 
well all art is an illusion basically

like painting the photo realistic
painting<00:02:12.160> for<00:02:12.370> example<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:15.160> digital

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
painting for example and with digital

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.790 
painting for example and with digital
art<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.090> really<00:02:16.720> interesting<00:02:16.959> because<00:02:17.230> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
art it's really interesting because you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.809 
art it's really interesting because you
can<00:02:18.550> create<00:02:19.200> illusion<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.319> everything<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
can create illusion of everything you

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.720 
can create illusion of everything you
can<00:02:22.060> do<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.750> recreate<00:02:23.380> analog<00:02:24.190> thing<00:02:24.459> so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
can do you can recreate analog thing so

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.760 
can do you can recreate analog thing so
you<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.480> really<00:02:25.900> plastic<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.770> purpose

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.500 

for<00:02:32.770> this<00:02:32.890> project<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.610> had<00:02:33.820> different<00:02:34.330> ideas

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
for this project I had different ideas

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.480 
for this project I had different ideas
and<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.890> wanted<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> do<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:38.050> had<00:02:38.500> few<00:02:38.890> ideas<00:02:39.040> in

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
and I wanted to do I had few ideas in

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.690 
and I wanted to do I had few ideas in
mind<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:39.990> at<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.170> last<00:02:41.320> minute<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.890> decided<00:02:42.340> to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
mind but at the last minute I decided to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.230 
mind but at the last minute I decided to
choose<00:02:43.410> something<00:02:44.410> from<00:02:44.800> mythology<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.820> was

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
choose something from mythology so I was

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.870 
choose something from mythology so I was
inspired<00:02:46.510> by<00:02:46.870> greek<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.070> slavic<00:02:48.610> mythology

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
inspired by greek and slavic mythology

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.210 
inspired by greek and slavic mythology
they<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:51.420> female<00:02:52.420> bird<00:02:52.810> kind<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.680> harpy

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
they have this female bird kind of harpy

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.400 
they have this female bird kind of harpy
and<00:02:54.460> I<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.180> decided<00:02:55.390> they<00:02:55.930> want<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.260> do

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and I just decided they want to do

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.170 
and I just decided they want to do
something<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.790> think<00:02:57.820> it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
something like that and I think it

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.780 
something like that and I think it
turned<00:02:58.450> out<00:02:58.540> pretty<00:02:58.840> good

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.170 

I'm<00:03:05.790> working<00:03:06.150> with<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:07.489> interest<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.849> 10

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I'm working with the interest like 10

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.710 
I'm working with the interest like 10
years<00:03:09.209> already<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.510> natural<00:03:12.510> i<00:03:12.660> do

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
years already so it just natural i do

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.890 
years already so it just natural i do
everything<00:03:13.319> with<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:14.090> I<00:03:15.090> don't<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.450> how<00:03:15.690> my

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
everything with it I I don't know how my

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.690 
everything with it I I don't know how my
work<00:03:16.140> would<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.739> if<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.190> wouldn't<00:03:17.610> have

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
work would be not if I wouldn't have

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.229 
work would be not if I wouldn't have
this<00:03:18.030> technology<00:03:18.300> can't<00:03:18.930> even<00:03:19.910> describe<00:03:20.910> it

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
this technology can't even describe it

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.930 
this technology can't even describe it
so<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.760> wouldn't<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.940> able<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.380> create<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.700> work

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
so I wouldn't be able to create the work

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.890
