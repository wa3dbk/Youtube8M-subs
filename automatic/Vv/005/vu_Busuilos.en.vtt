that for some reason kind of reminds me

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.199 
that for some reason kind of reminds me
of<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> 70s<00:02:59.290> maybe<00:02:59.920> disco<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.000> not

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
of the 70s maybe disco it's not

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.789 
of the 70s maybe disco it's not
completely<00:03:01.840> something<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.410> can<00:03:02.560> put<00:03:02.709> my

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
completely something that I can put my

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.250 
completely something that I can put my
finger<00:03:03.160> on<00:03:03.190> whether<00:03:03.940> is<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.450> rhythm<00:03:04.780> itself

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
finger on whether is the rhythm itself

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.470 
finger on whether is the rhythm itself
or<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> chord<00:03:05.829> progression<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.609> it's<00:03:07.030> there

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
or the chord progression but it's there

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.960 
or the chord progression but it's there
for<00:03:07.750> me<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.260> still<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:08.799> Nicki<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.730> dove<00:03:09.849> is

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
being pretty direct on this track they

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
sounds and effects like the bridge which

the<00:03:26.680> Dove<00:03:26.829> definitely<00:03:27.370> approaches<00:03:27.940> these

different<00:03:28.569> angles<00:03:29.049> with<00:03:29.500> some<00:03:30.190> nice<00:03:30.340> contrast

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
different angles with some nice contrast

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.490 
different angles with some nice contrast
between<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.750> verses<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.320> choruses

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
between the verses and the choruses

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.230 
between the verses and the choruses
some<00:03:33.650> decent<00:03:34.070> hooks<00:03:34.340> but<00:03:34.520> I'm<00:03:34.640> not<00:03:34.760> completely

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
some decent hooks but I'm not completely

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.320 
some decent hooks but I'm not completely
impressed<00:03:35.930> with<00:03:36.490> every<00:03:37.490> one<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.760> their<00:03:37.970> songs

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
impressed with every one of their songs

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.080 
impressed with every one of their songs
throughout<00:03:39.110> some<00:03:39.740> songs<00:03:40.040> really<00:03:40.670> strike<00:03:41.060> me

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
throughout some songs really strike me

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.200 
throughout some songs really strike me
as<00:03:41.270> having<00:03:41.660> some<00:03:41.870> pretty<00:03:42.530> corny<00:03:43.220> lyrics<00:03:43.850> most

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
as having some pretty corny lyrics most

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.990 
as having some pretty corny lyrics most
notably<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.810> beach<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:46.430> tracks<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
notably the beach and the tracks the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.990 
notably the beach and the tracks the
drummer<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:47.450> DJ<00:03:48.380> ease<00:03:48.650> my<00:03:48.890> mind<00:03:49.190> too

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
drummer and DJ ease my mind too

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.120 
drummer and DJ ease my mind too
but<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.240> thing<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.420> those<00:03:50.720> two<00:03:50.750> tracks<00:03:51.290> take

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
but the thing is those two tracks take

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.640 
but the thing is those two tracks take
an<00:03:52.430> overtly<00:03:53.120> electro<00:03:53.900> approach<00:03:54.320> with<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
an overtly electro approach with the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.500 
an overtly electro approach with the
production<00:03:55.160> which<00:03:55.310> kind<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:55.670> takes<00:03:55.940> me<00:03:56.180> out<00:03:56.450> of

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
production which kind of takes me out of

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.890 
production which kind of takes me out of
the<00:03:57.280> general<00:03:58.280> musical<00:03:58.730> theme<00:03:59.090> of<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.780> other

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
the general musical theme of the other

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.410 
the general musical theme of the other
tracks<00:04:00.290> which<00:04:01.100> makes<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.640> album<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.330> whole

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
tracks which makes this album as a whole

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.990 
tracks which makes this album as a whole
feel<00:04:02.810> kind<00:04:03.080> of<00:04:03.170> disjointed<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.520> most<00:04:04.820> of

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
feel kind of disjointed because most of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.510 
feel kind of disjointed because most of
the<00:04:05.090> time<00:04:05.360> Nikki<00:04:06.170> in<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.440> dev<00:04:06.620> are<00:04:06.860> switching

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520

the time Nikki in the dev are switching
back<00:04:07.730> and<00:04:07.790> forth<00:04:08.090> between<00:04:09.340> embracing<00:04:10.340> the

back and forth between embracing the

vocal style and I'm not really sure it

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.070 
vocal style and I'm not really sure it
fits<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.220> theme<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.970> song<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.810> really

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
fits the theme of the song so really

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.240 
fits the theme of the song so really
that's<00:04:45.200> kind<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.530> the<00:04:45.620> only<00:04:45.770> other<00:04:46.010> major

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
that's kind of the only other major

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.480 
that's kind of the only other major

there maybe there are moments that feel
a<00:05:08.300> little<00:05:08.810> more<00:05:09.080> lush<00:05:09.440> but<00:05:10.130> it's<00:05:10.460> not<00:05:10.640> like<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
a little more lush but it's not like the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.969 
a little more lush but it's not like the
songwriting<00:05:11.419> was<00:05:11.630> so<00:05:11.810> memorable<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
songwriting was so memorable and the

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.640 
songwriting was so memorable and the
ambition<00:05:13.669> was<00:05:13.880> so<00:05:14.140> immense<00:05:15.140> that<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.440> was

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
ambition was so immense that I was

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.590 
ambition was so immense that I was
consistently<00:05:16.370> impressed<00:05:16.820> with<00:05:17.030> this<00:05:17.180> LP

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
consistently impressed with this LP

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.469 
consistently impressed with this LP
especially<00:05:18.440> around<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.770> last<00:05:19.010> third<00:05:19.550> of<00:05:19.850> this

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
especially around the last third of this

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.690 
especially around the last third of this
album<00:05:20.780> where<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.530> think<00:05:21.950> Nicky<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.550> Dove

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
album where I think Nicky and the Dove

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.850 
album where I think Nicky and the Dove
pretty<00:05:22.970> much<00:05:23.090> stopped<00:05:23.479> adding<00:05:23.840> variety<00:05:24.169> it's

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
pretty much stopped adding variety it's

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.260 
pretty much stopped adding variety it's
actually<00:05:25.220> kind<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.430> weird<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.790> feel<00:05:25.820> like<00:05:26.180> the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
actually kind of weird I feel like the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.540 
actually kind of weird I feel like the
production<00:05:26.630> on<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.380> last<00:05:27.590> third<00:05:27.919> of<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.160> LP

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
production on that last third of this LP

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.400 
production on that last third of this LP
is<00:05:28.669> kind<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.940> different<00:05:29.240> -<00:05:29.419> it<00:05:29.780> feels<00:05:30.080> less

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
is kind of different - it feels less

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.640 
is kind of different - it feels less
lush<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.280> colorful<00:05:32.120> than<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.540> nine<00:05:33.260> or<00:05:33.470> so

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
lush and colorful than the nine or so

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.860 
lush and colorful than the nine or so
songs<00:05:33.979> that<00:05:34.340> come<00:05:34.580> before<00:05:34.790> it<00:05:35.090> it's<00:05:35.600> kind<00:05:35.840> of

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
songs that come before it it's kind of

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.210 
songs that come before it it's kind of
like<00:05:36.020> listening<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.590> an<00:05:36.710> entirely<00:05:37.070> different

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
like listening to an entirely different

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.570 
like listening to an entirely different
release<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:38.030> was<00:05:38.150> just<00:05:38.360> tagged<00:05:38.990> on<00:05:39.320> to<00:05:39.860> the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
release that was just tagged on to the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.940 
release that was just tagged on to the
back<00:05:40.820> end<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:41.780> thing<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.349> know<00:05:42.620> for<00:05:42.890> the

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
back end of this thing I know for the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.480 
back end of this thing I know for the
most<00:05:43.160> part<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.580> album<00:05:44.000> is<00:05:44.120> just

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
most part this album is just

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.240 
most part this album is just
culmination<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.300> tracks<00:05:45.630> that<00:05:46.250> pre-existed

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
culmination of tracks that pre-existed

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.029 
culmination of tracks that pre-existed
this<00:05:47.789> release<00:05:48.240> but<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:48.900> don't<00:05:49.500> really<00:05:49.800> feel

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
this release but I don't really feel

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.659 
this release but I don't really feel
like<00:05:50.099> that<00:05:50.430> should<00:05:50.910> be<00:05:51.229> so<00:05:52.229> apparent<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.520> it

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
like that should be so apparent that it

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.999 
like that should be so apparent that it
kind<00:05:53.849> of<00:05:53.910> ruins<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.449> flow<00:05:54.840> of<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.199> album<00:05:55.620> so

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
kind of ruins the flow of the album so

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.499 
kind of ruins the flow of the album so
I'm<00:05:56.310> kind<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.520> feeling<00:05:56.639> too<00:05:56.819> light<00:05:57.000> too<00:05:57.120> decent

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
I'm kind of feeling too light too decent
