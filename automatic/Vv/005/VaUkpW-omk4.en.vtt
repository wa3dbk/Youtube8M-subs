00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.590
 Hello everyone, program n2 + 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.330
 Today I decided to move away from my 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 familiar format and run-up 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 starry weekend in india which happens 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.400
 this weekend I would like to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.480
 delve into the story and tell you with 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.550
 what it all started 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.220
 we will talk about the first match of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 stars rewind history for 62 years 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.720
 back and start 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.000
 but 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.990
 in the early 50s popularity 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.330
 professional basketball in the usa was 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.890
 not too high behind such a view 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.170
 sports like american football 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.910
 baseball boxing and even student 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.680
 basketball however at the same time 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.540
 a series of scandal broke out in the student 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.440
 basketball related to juggling 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.390
 match results 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.800
 so the nba guide began to look 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.020
 ways to increase their popularity in 1951 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.729
 year president you sea ​​downturn love 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 hired as head of the department 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.180
 public relations 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.140
 haskele whom on that same year on one 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.330
 from meetings hem of a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.369
 owners of boston celtics walter brown 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.380
 and who offered the last idea 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.479
 holding a demonstration game like 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 all-star baseball league match 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.110
 which will be happy the best players 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.149
 associations although most owners 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.070
 clubs and podolog skeptical about 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.510
 this idea Brown was sure of success 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.400
 such an event 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.680
 he also offered to host the match at 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380
 his arena boston gordon and cover all 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.660
 expenses for its conduct despite 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.180
 optimism brown even weeks before the match is not 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.799
 it was known for sure whether it would take place 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.930
 as a podolog wanted to cancel it 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.330
 finally not spoil the face of the association 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.040
 when no one comes to the game it could 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.860
 finally undermine the reputation of young 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.630
 leagues and disgrace her better player forged 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.549
 also offered to give a small gift 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.560
 players who will participate in the game 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.360
 hem agreed with the condition that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.850
 gifts would not be worth more than two 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.709
 dollars each later who succeeded 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 enter into a contract with a local store and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.060

 got 50 dollars 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.489
 despite the fact that brown I organized 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.070

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.600

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.120
 Friday March 2, 1951 more than ten 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.650
 thousand people came to boston gordon 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.820
 to watch the first ever match 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.710
 all stars n2 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720
 team coaches met their 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.180
 wards only locker rooms shortly 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.910
 night warm-up there stripped like a 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.440
 players took a short interview 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.630
 west team mentor jong un two 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.100
 later admitted to being a little scared 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.660
 the fact that he will have to head 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.640
 so many stars on one team 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.650
 so for the time he had it 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.840
 sketched a few simple schemes to players 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.850
 games fortunately for him in the team was 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.160
 three players from me were sneakers 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.320
 so his blanks with worked well 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.780
 both teams were quite different 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.030
 among themselves on the style of the game so in the team 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.830
 of the West were such game experts in 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.890
 front line like mike king mickelson 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.960
 thunderstorms and fast as well as bird &amp; defenders 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.180
 davis who could go fast 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.500
 breakthrough at every opportunity in 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.570
 the team of the east prevailed 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.030
 middle distance specialists such as 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.440
 uzi to Philippe and thus Maguire 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.750
 expected confrontation force 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.490
 basketball vs speed for coach 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.220
 teams of the east the main problem was 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.690
 center opponents george shirts 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.520
 so against her bra put and 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.800
 at home if that usually showed 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.450
 good game against t-shirts on and when they 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.490
 played against each other them 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.949
 statistics were about 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.030
 in the match, the east team defeated the west 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:45.530
 with a score of 111 94 with a gap of 17 points in 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.330
 the game did not complete one throw 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.729
 top unlike modern match 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.229
 all the stars in the leaders on points in the east 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.169

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.030
 that the team allowed to raise 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.099
 league popularity and the latter also 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.660

 free salary of 100 dollars at that 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.259
 time is remembered more than the rings in 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.340
 subsequent games financially match 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.560
