this<00:00:11.429> thing<00:00:11.490> looks<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.360> question<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:12.900> though

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
this thing looks the question is though

this thing looks the question is though
will<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.740> controversial<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.910> last

will it be as controversial as the last

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.390 
will it be as controversial as the last
one<00:00:18.199> I've<00:00:19.199> noticed<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> there<00:00:19.920> always<00:00:20.070> seems

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
one I've noticed that there always seems

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.310 
one I've noticed that there always seems
to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> big<00:00:20.789> stir<00:00:21.029> around<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.689> official

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
to be a big stir around the official

World Cup soccer ball to help explain
this<00:00:24.300> let's<00:00:24.689> first<00:00:24.960> look<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.199> how<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.560> ball

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this let's first look at how the ball

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.779 
this let's first look at how the ball
has<00:00:26.189> changed<00:00:26.760> over<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> years<00:00:27.439> up<00:00:28.439> until<00:00:28.789> 2006

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
has changed over the years up until 2006

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.880 
has changed over the years up until 2006
the<00:00:30.060> ball<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.539> composed<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> traditional

architect Richard Buckminster Fuller who
came<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.210> with<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> design<00:00:39.809> as<00:00:40.050> he<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.350> trying

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
came up with the design as he was trying

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.690 
came up with the design as he was trying
to<00:00:40.620> find<00:00:40.829> new<00:00:40.980> ways<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> constructing

to find new ways of constructing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729 
to find new ways of constructing

a perfectly round ball they called it
and<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.570> shouldn't<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.200> good

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and really shouldn't this be a good

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
and really shouldn't this be a good
thing<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.180> big<00:01:12.360> design

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
thing the thing is the big design

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
thing the thing is the big design
difference<00:01:13.200> makes<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.860> ball<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
difference makes the ball different to

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.570 
difference makes the ball different to

seams and shallower seams as they were

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
seams and shallower seams as they were
no<00:01:22.950> longer<00:01:23.159> stitched<00:01:23.670> together<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.630> result

no longer stitched together the result

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
no longer stitched together the result
was<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> smooth<00:01:25.500> ball<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.070> had<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> floating

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
was a smooth ball but it had a floating

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.609 
was a smooth ball but it had a floating
beach<00:01:27.150> ball<00:01:27.420> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> behavior<00:01:28.200> at<00:01:28.380> high

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
beach ball kind of behavior at high

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
beach ball kind of behavior at high
speeds<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> issue<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.299> forwards

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
speeds so the issue was that forwards

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
speeds so the issue was that forwards
had<00:01:31.409> problems<00:01:31.799> shooting<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> then

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
had problems shooting it and then

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.539 
had problems shooting it and then
goalies<00:01:33.450> had<00:01:33.659> problems<00:01:34.140> catching<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.680> alright

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
goalies had problems catching it alright

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.950 
goalies had problems catching it alright
that<00:01:35.729> brings<00:01:35.850> us<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> brazuca<00:01:36.689> ball

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that brings us back to the brazuca ball

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
that brings us back to the brazuca ball
and<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.100> have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and you think that they would have

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.950 
and you think that they would have
learned<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.549> lesson<00:01:38.700> by<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> gone<00:01:39.570> back<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
learned a lesson by now and gone back to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
learned a lesson by now and gone back to
a<00:01:39.990> greater<00:01:40.290> number<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.680> panels<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.060> not

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
a greater number of panels but it's not

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.660 
a greater number of panels but it's not
the<00:01:42.479> case<00:01:42.720> we're<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.200> down<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.680> six<00:01:43.979> panels

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the case we're now down to six panels

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
the case we're now down to six panels
but<00:01:45.240> instead<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.630> being<00:01:45.840> smooth<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.530> roughed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
but instead of being smooth they roughed

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.990 
but instead of being smooth they roughed
them<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.460> are<00:01:47.520> still<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.909> together

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
them up they are still put together

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.330 
them up they are still put together
through<00:01:48.390> thermal<00:01:48.750> bonding<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.680> instead<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
through thermal bonding but instead of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.830 
through thermal bonding but instead of
being<00:01:50.729> really<00:01:51.119> shallow<00:01:51.390> they've<00:01:51.659> actually

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
being really shallow they've actually

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.319 
being really shallow they've actually
made<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.560> seam<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.220> lot<00:01:53.490> deeper<00:01:53.700> again<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.299> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
made the seam a lot deeper again kind of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.080 
made the seam a lot deeper again kind of
like<00:01:54.390> back<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.470> old<00:01:55.619> stitch<00:01:56.100> 32<00:01:56.759> panel

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
like back to the old stitch 32 panel

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
but how it holds up in the games well

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.240 
but how it holds up in the games well
it's<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.330> wait<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:13.130> all<00:02:14.130> right

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
