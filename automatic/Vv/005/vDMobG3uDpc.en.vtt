00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.740
 the other teens do impact 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.500
 and how are you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 that's curled up 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.179
 so compact 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.439
 if it's really time 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.470
 expands 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.470
 quite large permian wood is suitable 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 Right angle from the Catholic church 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.529
 so delicious 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.370
 and it was not meant to be there 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.120
 for example, simply other cameras Christmas objective Wowereit 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.470
 Something must Nowitzki is mainly thought to lied 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 how to travel around, for example, to accommodate the stuff in your head 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.510
 to pack again closer 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 These facilities should be deleted on both sides 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 in other countries it is a bit diminished 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.550
 and that is also the counterpart 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 to the source of fire Peter Schuster is by her side 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.560
 and of course a big man 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.480
 as one of the top teams here so needed from the bus of an object or 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.270
 flared so we would have moved this strip something on this way 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.760
 because that's the Rome so this thought 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 that's not true 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310
 that's why he is criticized too 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.580
 with this whole 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.230
 Spacing across all this wide they say here on both sides 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.140
 negative 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 everyone in the hall was also easy to shut up 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.850
 SOB 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 I have it for example 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.610
 Canon 54 de 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.390
 with a 28 and 38 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.280
 that's how Bommer struck 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.670
 and that's so wonderful 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 pack 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 from the since over and then 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.420
 Streibl easy 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.640
 connect and make 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.210
 and of course from the other side as well 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.600
 for the eighth time here and advice why 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.760
 and and here outside grazed 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.420
 and attached 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.919
 the whole is then 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.589
 Son, for example, packed 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.299
 and as she said that it took no solution to the intended meeting 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.329
 and just getting out of the said accident is chatting but 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.779
 these things are packaged as they are shockproof for example in a suitcase or 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.549
 Just keep Bud backpack 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.939
 Of course, the facts are also fully deserved with 1 0 7 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.919
 Who, for example, that you are here Bitkom 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.169
 Zack just like that 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.429
 spent three times 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.429
 Visitors wait 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:45.999
 and so Troost the whole 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.999
 pro sure 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.609
 Take the green light for Take that but always have it with you when you go 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.309
 she needs or does not know exactly if you need it 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:01.309
 dpa what just together again 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 but how much too careless together 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:10.119
 just the whole country in such a 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.949
 that's one of those 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.009
 Nylon python- to be able to 81 that has simply one 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.489
 Carsten Gockel just has to push us a violation 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.899
 not only suppress 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.899
 that pulls it together 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:30.069
 and so does the concept packed up not necessary 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.219
 cause we are well 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.389
 and a good protection for 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.919
 to find expensive and valuable
