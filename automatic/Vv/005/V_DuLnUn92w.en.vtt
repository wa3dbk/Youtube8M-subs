right here Franken well pro boxing made
from<00:01:05.180> Kuwait<00:01:05.740> 40nm<00:01:06.740> tree<00:01:06.979> not<00:01:07.250> 45<00:01:07.640> energy<00:01:07.970> and

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
from Kuwait 40nm tree not 45 energy and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.100 
from Kuwait 40nm tree not 45 energy and
is<00:01:10.310> now<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.860> is<00:01:12.979> she<00:01:13.100> trying<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.399> do<00:01:13.700> here<00:01:14.110> ok

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
so he's trying to go through the wall

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.730 
so he's trying to go through the wall
and<00:01:17.060> attack<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.539> orb<00:01:17.979> wells<00:01:20.470> since<00:01:21.470> there<00:01:21.649> are

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
and attack the orb wells since there are

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.949 
and attack the orb wells since there are
archers<00:01:22.220> our<00:01:22.640> long-range<00:01:23.300> units<00:01:23.690> can<00:01:23.840> go

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
archers our long-range units can go

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.139 
archers our long-range units can go
through<00:01:24.229> walls<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.830> attack<00:01:25.069> which<00:01:25.910> is<00:01:26.030> exactly

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
through walls to attack which is exactly

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.050 
through walls to attack which is exactly
with<00:01:26.539> frontage<00:01:26.990> trying<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.410> do<00:01:28.060> while

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
with frontage trying to do while

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.290 
with frontage trying to do while
prolapse<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:29.869> going<00:01:30.110> T<00:01:30.289> to<00:01:30.319> and<00:01:31.300> making

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
prolapse is going T to and making

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.949 
prolapse is going T to and making
frontal<00:01:32.929> waste<00:01:33.110> energy<00:01:33.349> in<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.950> main<00:01:34.099> mix<00:01:37.959> so

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
frontal waste energy in the main mix so

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.570 
frontal waste energy in the main mix so
now<00:01:39.080> prob<00:01:39.319> laughs<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.619> gotta<00:01:39.800> see<00:01:40.069> two<00:01:40.310> and

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
now Frank is waiting for energy to 42

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.849 
now Frank is waiting for energy to 42
but<00:01:55.119> it<00:01:55.359> is<00:01:55.810> getting<00:01:55.929> quickly<00:01:56.500> countered

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
since franchise number one frost player

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.300 
since franchise number one frost player
but<00:02:41.099> yet<00:02:41.280> loses<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.790> fire<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.950> biggest

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
but yet loses to fire with the biggest

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
but yet loses to fire with the biggest
advantage<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.970> game<00:02:45.000> frost<00:02:45.540> versus<00:02:45.930> fire

that's<00:02:47.629> kind<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.810> ironic<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:51.019> mean<00:02:52.019> water<00:02:52.260> beeps

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that's kind of ironic I mean water beeps

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.979 
that's kind of ironic I mean water beeps
fire<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:55.159> ice<00:02:56.159> is<00:02:56.849> basically<00:02:57.389> water<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:59.989> so

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
fire and ice is basically water is so

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.879 
fire and ice is basically water is so
spin<00:03:01.379> she<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:02.180> prop<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.329> sees<00:03:03.569> just<00:03:04.290> getting

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
spin she is prop up sees just getting

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.759 
spin she is prop up sees just getting
some<00:03:05.069> energy<00:03:05.609> i'm<00:03:05.849> guessing<00:03:06.299> who<00:03:07.079> else<00:03:07.319> yeah

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
some energy i'm guessing who else yeah

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.270 
some energy i'm guessing who else yeah
there<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.099> go<00:03:08.180> we<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.329> got<00:03:09.450> another<00:03:09.629> one<00:03:09.810> I

on<00:04:58.910> tues<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.389> wells<00:05:00.250> basically<00:05:01.250> aggressive

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
on tues to wells basically aggressive

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.339 
on tues to wells basically aggressive
well<00:05:01.729> actually<00:05:01.880> minus<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.630> world<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.110> so

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
well actually minus the world there so

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:09.670 
well actually minus the world there so
it's<00:05:03.470> three<00:05:03.710> walls<00:05:03.889> on<00:05:04.099> 22<00:05:06.069> but<00:05:07.069> yeah<00:05:08.680> overall

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
it's three walls on 22 but yeah overall

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.820 
it's three walls on 22 but yeah overall
spinach<00:05:10.160> is<00:05:10.280> doing<00:05:10.490> a<00:05:10.550> great<00:05:10.669> job<00:05:11.620> now<00:05:12.620> he's

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
spinach is doing a great job now he's

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.230 
spinach is doing a great job now he's
destroying<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.400> wells<00:05:13.580> there<00:05:13.849> and<00:05:16.030> Frank<00:05:17.030> was

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
destroying the wells there and Frank was

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.719 
destroying the wells there and Frank was
too<00:05:17.419> busy<00:05:18.849> and<00:05:19.849> what<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:21.250> lets<00:05:22.250> just<00:05:22.430> going

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
too busy and what this lets just going

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.189 
too busy and what this lets just going
too<00:05:22.910> much<00:05:23.150> yet<00:05:23.740> she<00:05:24.740> has<00:05:24.949> too<00:05:25.130> much<00:05:25.250> energy<00:05:25.520> can

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
too much yet she has too much energy can

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.129 
too much yet she has too much energy can
easily<00:05:27.199> go<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:28.270> three<00:05:29.270> right<00:05:29.449> now<00:05:29.630> but<00:05:29.870> I<00:05:29.900> think

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
easily go to three right now but I think

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.850 
easily go to three right now but I think
he's<00:05:30.229> an<00:05:30.380> Anderson<00:05:31.360> yeah<00:05:32.360> well<00:05:32.599> by<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.139> number

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
he's an Anderson yeah well by the number

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.860 
he's an Anderson yeah well by the number
of<00:05:33.889> time<00:05:34.160> left<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:34.669> she's<00:05:35.300> basically<00:05:35.570> gonna

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
of time left and she's basically gonna

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.170 
of time left and she's basically gonna
end<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.380> same<00:05:36.590> g2

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180
