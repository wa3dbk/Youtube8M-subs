accelerator<00:03:36.370> but<00:03:36.609> I'm<00:03:36.730> just<00:03:36.969> slightly<00:03:37.180> below

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
accelerator but I'm just slightly below

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.539 
accelerator but I'm just slightly below
and<00:03:37.629> it<00:03:37.719> doesn't<00:03:37.959> register<00:03:38.189> that's<00:03:39.189> a<00:03:39.310> little

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
and it doesn't register that's a little

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.970 
and it doesn't register that's a little
bit<00:03:39.639> of<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.939> weird<00:03:40.450> thing<00:03:40.689> but<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.439> can<00:03:41.680> play

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
bit of a weird thing but you can play

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.500 
bit of a weird thing but you can play
around<00:03:42.099> with<00:03:42.459> their<00:03:42.579> options<00:03:42.969> on<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.269> so<00:03:43.450> if

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
around with their options on this so if

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.679 
around with their options on this so if
i<00:03:43.629> go<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> say<00:03:44.769> home<00:03:45.299> go<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.980> options<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.819> then

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:49.689 
i go to say home go to options and then

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.580 
i go to say home go to options and then
controls<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:52.599> can<00:03:52.629> also<00:03:53.049> mess<00:03:53.290> with<00:03:53.439> their

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
controls you can also mess with their

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.920 
controls you can also mess with their
use<00:03:53.799> analog<00:03:54.250> steering<00:03:54.760> as<00:03:54.879> well<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.870> can

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
use analog steering as well so you can

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.589 
use analog steering as well so you can
turn<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.349> on<00:03:56.409> and<00:03:56.969> then<00:03:57.969> if<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.239> go<00:03:58.329> back<00:03:58.540> to

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
turn that on and then if you go back to

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.470 
turn that on and then if you go back to
the<00:03:58.750> game<00:03:59.430> itself<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.909> don't<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.299> the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the game itself you don't have the

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800 
the game itself you don't have the
buttons<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.139> such<00:04:02.409> so<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:04.209> just<00:04:04.359> resume<00:04:04.689> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
buttons as such so you just resume the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.800 
buttons as such so you just resume the
game<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.819> you<00:04:06.909> got<00:04:07.030> no<00:04:07.150> button<00:04:07.449> there<00:04:07.629> but

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
game so you got no button there but

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.470 
game so you got no button there but
you've<00:04:07.930> got<00:04:08.109> this<00:04:08.290> little<00:04:08.590> joystick<00:04:08.919> I<00:04:09.480> find

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
you've got this little joystick I find

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.119 
you've got this little joystick I find
this<00:04:10.599> little<00:04:10.840> joystick<00:04:11.139> harder<00:04:12.099> to<00:04:12.280> use

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
this little joystick harder to use

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.080 
this little joystick harder to use
because<00:04:15.129> it<00:04:15.280> doesn't<00:04:15.579> go<00:04:15.639> in<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.819> straight<00:04:15.969> line

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
because it doesn't go in a straight line

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.759 
because it doesn't go in a straight line
when<00:04:16.449> you<00:04:16.539> let<00:04:16.690> go<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:17.109> just<00:04:17.139> keeps<00:04:17.500> on<00:04:17.620> going

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
when you let go it just keeps on going

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.830 
when you let go it just keeps on going
in<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.039> direction<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.639> where<00:04:19.359> ever<00:04:19.509> you<00:04:19.690> were

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
in the direction of where ever you were

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.930 
in the direction of where ever you were
last<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.470> I'll<00:04:21.220> find<00:04:21.430> out<00:04:21.549> a<00:04:21.579> little<00:04:21.789> bit

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
last and I'll find out a little bit

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.460 
last and I'll find out a little bit
unknown<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.539> be<00:04:22.630> fair<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:22.930> I'll<00:04:23.050> keep<00:04:23.289> on

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
unknown to be fair and I'll keep on

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.450 
unknown to be fair and I'll keep on
hitting<00:04:25.530> whoops<00:04:26.530> I'm<00:04:26.710> going<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.919> go<00:04:27.009> after<00:04:27.160> so

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
hitting whoops I'm going to go after so

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.089 
hitting whoops I'm going to go after so
I'd<00:04:27.580> keep<00:04:27.789> on<00:04:27.970> hitting<00:04:28.330> stuff<00:04:28.539> I<00:04:28.660> shouldn't<00:04:28.900> be

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
I'd keep on hitting stuff I shouldn't be

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.520 
I'd keep on hitting stuff I shouldn't be
so<00:04:30.099> as<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.610> notice<00:04:30.940> it's<00:04:31.120> on<00:04:31.300> from<00:04:31.870> dragging

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
so as you notice it's on from dragging

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.529 
so as you notice it's on from dragging
off<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.830> screen<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.310> control<00:04:33.669> disappears<00:04:34.270> as

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
off the screen the control disappears as

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.260 
off the screen the control disappears as
it<00:04:34.690> does<00:04:34.870> there<00:04:35.669> see<00:04:36.669> if<00:04:36.699> I'm<00:04:36.880> dragging<00:04:37.180> off

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
it does there see if I'm dragging off

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.420 
it does there see if I'm dragging off
screens

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
screens

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.159 
screens
not<00:04:40.430> prefer<00:04:40.729> that<00:04:40.909> not<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.300> happen<00:04:41.479> really<00:04:41.810> so

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
not prefer that not to happen really so

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.279 
not prefer that not to happen really so
it's<00:04:42.800> better<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.610> do<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.759> with<00:04:44.169> keeping<00:04:45.169> your

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
it's better to do it with keeping your

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.350 
it's better to do it with keeping your
fingers<00:04:45.469> on<00:04:45.830> natural<00:04:46.520> screen<00:04:46.849> but<00:04:47.090> it's<00:04:47.180> very

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
fingers on natural screen but it's very

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.360 
fingers on natural screen but it's very
hard<00:04:47.659> to<00:04:47.749> do<00:04:48.020> when<00:04:48.710> you're<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.039> middle<00:04:49.219> of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
hard to do when you're in the middle of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.550 
hard to do when you're in the middle of
playing<00:04:49.580> again<00:04:49.939> I'm<00:04:50.810> doing<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.139> middle<00:04:51.379> of<00:04:51.499> a
