you<00:00:22.790> like<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.030> normal<00:00:23.300> type<00:00:26.830> you<00:00:27.830> guys<00:00:27.950> do

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
you like the normal type you guys do

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.690 
you like the normal type you guys do
this<00:00:28.190> every<00:00:28.310> day

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
this every day

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.160 
this every day
yep<00:00:29.860> point<00:00:30.860> five<00:00:31.280> twice<00:00:31.870> Walker<00:00:32.870> Valley

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
yep point five twice Walker Valley

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.400 
yep point five twice Walker Valley
taking<00:00:36.170> that<00:00:36.440> last<00:00:36.860> one<00:00:37.130> attack<00:00:38.260> back<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
taking that last one attack back the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.600 
taking that last one attack back the
tree<00:00:39.590> I<00:00:40.430> think<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.059> open<00:00:42.160> doesn't<00:00:43.160> like

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
tree I think it's open doesn't like

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.110 
tree I think it's open doesn't like
school<00:00:43.850> better<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.280> every<00:00:46.280> day

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.870 

okay<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:50.900> I<00:00:51.140> am<00:00:51.530> using<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.220> Norman<00:00:52.610> Texas

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
okay so I am using the Norman Texas

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.860 
okay so I am using the Norman Texas
cover<00:00:53.090> unit

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
cover unit

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.050 
cover unit
what<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.650> does<00:00:54.830> is<00:00:55.130> it<00:00:55.310> uses<00:00:55.490> pulsing

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
what it does is it uses pulsing

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.270 
what it does is it uses pulsing
technology<00:00:56.660> start<00:00:57.350> starting<00:00:57.860> at<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.130> very

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
technology start starting at the very

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.729 
technology start starting at the very
distal<00:00:58.760> ends<00:00:59.090> of<00:00:59.150> my<00:00:59.330> lower<00:01:00.080> extremities<00:01:00.140> so

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
distal ends of my lower extremities so

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.700 
distal ends of my lower extremities so
right<00:01:00.920> at<00:01:01.070> my<00:01:01.190> feet<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:02.260> creates<00:01:03.260> intermittent

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
right at my feet it creates intermittent

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.130 
right at my feet it creates intermittent
compression<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.850> goes<00:01:05.030> up<00:01:05.300> through<00:01:05.990> my

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
compression and it goes up through my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.730 
compression and it goes up through my
legs<00:01:06.410> forcing<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.600> fluid<00:01:08.619> circulation<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
legs forcing the fluid circulation and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.219 
legs forcing the fluid circulation and
blood<00:01:09.920> flow<00:01:10.070> back<00:01:10.340> up<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.940> my<00:01:11.060> torso<00:01:11.330> this

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
blood flow back up to my torso this

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.240 
blood flow back up to my torso this
helps<00:01:12.590> stimulate<00:01:13.810> recovery<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.890> cool

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
helps stimulate recovery and the cool

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.550 
helps stimulate recovery and the cool
thing<00:01:16.400> about<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.820> once<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.110> compression

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
thing about it is once the compression

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.800 
thing about it is once the compression
comes<00:01:18.800> up<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.640> maintains<00:01:20.240> compressions

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
comes up it maintains compressions

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.690 
comes up it maintains compressions
distally<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.070> fluid<00:01:22.340> doesn't<00:01:22.490> go

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
distally so that the fluid doesn't go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.850 
distally so that the fluid doesn't go
