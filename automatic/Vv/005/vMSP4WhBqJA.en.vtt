time on a single serving basis this is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
time on a single serving basis this is
what<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> product<00:00:44.460> looks<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:44.960> it's<00:00:45.960> got<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
what the product looks like it's got a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
what the product looks like it's got a
vessel<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> top<00:00:47.280> where<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.489> line<00:00:47.700> sets

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
vessel in the top where the line sets

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.790 
vessel in the top where the line sets
and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> narrating<00:00:48.870> chamber<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.379> then

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and then a narrating chamber and then

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
and then a narrating chamber and then
the<00:00:49.920> wine<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.370> released<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.300> glass

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the wine is released out into the glass

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.760 
the wine is released out into the glass
and<00:00:51.719> here's<00:00:51.899> how<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.140> works

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.720 

so<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.860> can<00:00:58.950> hear<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.430> sounds

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so you can hear the way that sounds

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.670 
so you can hear the way that sounds
right<00:00:59.880> all<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.329> aeration<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.200> creates

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
right all that aeration going on creates

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.930 
right all that aeration going on creates
that<00:01:01.800> sound<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.400> you<00:01:02.460> look<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:02.790> glass

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that sound then if you look in the glass

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.460 
that sound then if you look in the glass
after<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:03.450> pour<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> wine<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.350> those

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
after you pour the wine to see all those

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.830 
after you pour the wine to see all those
bubbles<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:04.979> top<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:06.330> indicate

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
bubbles on the top and they indicate

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
bubbles on the top and they indicate
aeration<00:01:07.380> goodness<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.220> small

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
mitz ready to go so there's three

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
mitz ready to go so there's three
characteristics<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> product<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
characteristics of this product that I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
characteristics of this product that I
think<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:13.920> pretty<00:01:14.100> unique<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.060> first<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
think are pretty unique the first is

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
think are pretty unique the first is
that<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.780> made<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.290> cast<00:01:16.680> acrylic<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that it's made of cast acrylic it's a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.090 
that it's made of cast acrylic it's a
plastic<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> glass<00:01:18.690> if<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> accidentally

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
plastic not a glass if you accidentally

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
plastic not a glass if you accidentally
tap<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> counter<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
tap it on the counter it's not going to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.050 
tap it on the counter it's not going to
break<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.350> has<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.860> smooth<00:01:23.640> seamless

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
break it has a very smooth seamless

break it has a very smooth seamless
appearance<00:01:24.630> I've<00:01:24.720> told<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.050> it's<00:01:25.170> turned<00:01:25.410> on

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
appearance I've told that it's turned on

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
appearance I've told that it's turned on
a<00:01:25.590> lathe<00:01:25.860> how<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.250> make<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.210> most

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
a lathe how they make it it's most

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.180

the<00:03:10.379> future<00:03:10.560> i'll<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.800> doing<00:03:10.920> probably<00:03:11.220> a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the future i'll be doing probably a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.820 
the future i'll be doing probably a
three-way<00:03:11.790> comparison<00:03:12.780> between<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.410> recipe

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
three-way comparison between the recipe

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.150 
three-way comparison between the recipe
era<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.670> venturi<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.360> also<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:15.810> soiree<00:03:16.160> the

era the venturi and also the soiree the
soiree<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.700> quite<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.360> bit<00:03:18.569> different<00:03:18.690> from

soiree is quite a bit different from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.750 
soiree is quite a bit different from
this<00:03:19.110> product<00:03:19.440> remember<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.519> the

this product remember this is a on the
bottle<00:03:21.290> aerator<00:03:22.290> right<00:03:22.500> you<00:03:22.620> should<00:03:22.709> put<00:03:22.860> it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
bottle aerator right you should put it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.650 
bottle aerator right you should put it
on<00:03:23.010> there<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.700> pour<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.000> line<00:03:24.239> through

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
on there and you pour the line through

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.270 
on there and you pour the line through
there<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.379> kind<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> whole<00:03:25.830> different<00:03:26.129> class

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
there so kind of a whole different class

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
there so kind of a whole different class
of<00:03:26.310> products<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.910> terms<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.750> way<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.140> works

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
of products in terms of the way it works

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.470 
of products in terms of the way it works
conceptually<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.730> they're<00:03:29.849> all<00:03:29.940> targeted<00:03:30.390> at

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
conceptually but they're all targeted at

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.059 
conceptually but they're all targeted at
the<00:03:30.569> same<00:03:30.780> problem<00:03:31.080> area<00:03:31.319> into<00:03:31.530> wine<00:03:31.680> quickly

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
the same problem area into wine quickly

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.330 
the same problem area into wine quickly
and<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.400> fly<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.930> product<00:03:34.170> lists<00:03:35.069> for

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
and on the fly so this product lists for

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.949 
and on the fly so this product lists for
thirty-five<00:03:35.880> dollars<00:03:36.090> i<00:03:36.390> believe<00:03:36.630> whereas

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
thirty-five dollars i believe whereas

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.259 
thirty-five dollars i believe whereas
the<00:03:37.110> venturi<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.920> at<00:03:38.069> forty<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.610> soiree<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.150> it

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
the venturi is at forty the soiree is it

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.030 
the venturi is at forty the soiree is it
25<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.140> where<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.319> comes<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.590> terms<00:03:40.860> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
25 so that's where it comes in terms of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.759 
25 so that's where it comes in terms of
price<00:03:42.000> point<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.930> terms<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.290> minded

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
price point in terms of minded

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.259 
price point in terms of minded
criticisms<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> only<00:03:44.670> thing<00:03:44.760> haven't<00:03:45.180> been

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269

too thrilled with our the stand it

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:48.890 
too thrilled with our the stand it
really<00:03:47.940> doesn't<00:03:48.150> work<00:03:48.239> too<00:03:48.390> well<00:03:48.420> as<00:03:48.629> it<00:03:48.720> drips

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
really doesn't work too well as it drips

really doesn't work too well as it drips
tin<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.319> it<00:03:49.410> kind<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.650> adheres<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.190> the

here<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.069> probably<00:03:53.099> wouldn't<00:03:53.489> make<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.640> real

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
