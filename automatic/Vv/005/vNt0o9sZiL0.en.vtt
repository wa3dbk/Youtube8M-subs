effectiveness<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.790> bipod<00:01:36.270> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
effectiveness now on to the bipod and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.780 
effectiveness now on to the bipod and
I've<00:01:36.600> found<00:01:36.720> by<00:01:36.960> floods<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:37.759> much<00:01:38.759> more

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
I've found by floods for me much more

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.310 
I've found by floods for me much more
effective<00:01:39.329> than<00:01:39.420> running<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> gunning<00:01:40.049> with

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
effective than running and gunning with

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
effective than running and gunning with
a<00:01:40.350> grip<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> again<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.790> your

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
a grip and again it's all about your

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
a grip and again it's all about your
playstyle<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.770> with

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
playstyle here so what I like to do with

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.789 
playstyle here so what I like to do with
LMGs<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.579> moving<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.270> setup<00:01:45.720> wait<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> then

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
LMGs is moving and setup wait and then

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319 
LMGs is moving and setup wait and then
move<00:01:46.979> again<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> another<00:01:47.490> spot<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.030> repeat

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
move again to another spot and repeat

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.149 
move again to another spot and repeat
the<00:01:48.360> process<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.710> why<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the process and you will see why in the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.469 
the process and you will see why in the
background<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> sometimes<00:01:51.090> his<00:01:51.210> weapon

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
background that sometimes his weapon

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.670 
background that sometimes his weapon
isn't<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.869> greatest<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> come<00:01:52.470> under

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
isn't the greatest when you come under

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.889 
isn't the greatest when you come under
pressure<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:53.220> play<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> safe<00:01:54.329> when<00:01:54.540> using<00:01:54.780> em

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
pressure so play it safe when using em

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.499 
pressure so play it safe when using em
to<00:01:55.110> 40<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.680> set<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:56.549> bipod<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:56.969> drop<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
to 40 be set up your bipod and drop the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.330 
to 40 be set up your bipod and drop the
targets<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:57.990> they<00:01:58.110> come<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.590> another

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
targets as they come to you another

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
targets as they come to you another
great<00:01:59.549> advantage<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> bipod<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
great advantage to you the bipod is the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
great advantage to you the bipod is the
range<00:02:01.259> factor<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.219> actually<00:02:02.399> very<00:02:02.579> good<00:02:03.000> at

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
range factor it is actually very good at

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
range factor it is actually very good at
suppressing<00:02:03.540> long-range<00:02:04.140> target<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.799> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
suppressing long-range target and it is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
suppressing long-range target and it is
quite<00:02:05.100> possible<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.670> set<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.390> far<00:02:06.630> away

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
quite possible to set up very far away

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.809 
quite possible to set up very far away
from<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.259> enemies<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.710> drop<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> few<00:02:08.399> targets

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
from your enemies and drop a few targets

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.979 
from your enemies and drop a few targets
from<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.780> where<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
from there and this is where the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.040 
from there and this is where the
magnifier<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:10.860> have

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
magnifier can really have

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.200 
magnifier can really have
about<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.470> having<00:02:12.190> said<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.430> though<00:02:12.820> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
about to having said that though the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.490 
about to having said that though the
weapon<00:02:13.510> can<00:02:13.780> still<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.170> used<00:02:14.320> for

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
weapon can still be used for

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.960 
weapon can still be used for
close-quarter<00:02:14.980> takedowns<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.760> higher

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
close-quarter takedowns it's higher

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.940 
close-quarter takedowns it's higher
damage<00:02:16.210> output<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.930> rate<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.200> fire<00:02:17.530> can<00:02:17.770> drop

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
damage output and rate of fire can drop

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.860 
damage output and rate of fire can drop
groups<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.430> enemies<00:02:18.550> rather<00:02:18.940> fast<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.720> can

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
groups of enemies rather fast you can

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.390 
groups of enemies rather fast you can
either<00:02:19.960> hit<00:02:20.170> fire<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.740> enemy<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:20.980> really

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
either hit fire if the enemy is really

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160 
either hit fire if the enemy is really
really<00:02:21.580> close<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.690> guys<00:02:22.870> might<00:02:23.050> be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
really close so you guys might be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.570 
really close so you guys might be
thinking<00:02:23.410> about<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> low<00:02:23.830> magazine<00:02:24.250> size<00:02:24.460> of

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
thinking about a low magazine size of

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.250 
thinking about a low magazine size of
100<00:02:24.910> with<00:02:25.000> only<00:02:25.120> one<00:02:25.360> other<00:02:25.510> magazine<00:02:25.960> at<00:02:26.140> your

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
100 with only one other magazine at your

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140 
100 with only one other magazine at your
disposal<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.520> downsides<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
disposal this is one of the downsides to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.940 
disposal this is one of the downsides to
this<00:02:28.180> weapon<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.960> low<00:02:29.140> ammo<00:02:29.380> count<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
this weapon the low ammo count and the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.200 
this weapon the low ammo count and the
high<00:02:30.100> rate<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.340> fire<00:02:30.460> can<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.060> make

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
high rate of fire can really make

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.670 
high rate of fire can really make
problems<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.810> especially<00:02:32.470> when<00:02:32.530> you're

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
problems for you especially when you're

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.260 
problems for you especially when you're
planning<00:02:32.830> aggressive<00:02:33.310> you'll<00:02:33.850> find<00:02:34.120> yourself

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
planning aggressive you'll find yourself

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.940 
planning aggressive you'll find yourself
constantly<00:02:34.720> reloading<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.650> refurnished

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
constantly reloading it and refurnished

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.010 
constantly reloading it and refurnished
in<00:02:36.160> your<00:02:36.280> animo<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.300> reload<00:02:37.600> speed<00:02:37.780> is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
in your animo and the reload speed is

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.990 
in your animo and the reload speed is
rather<00:02:38.200> slow<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:38.800> well<00:02:39.130> so<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.940> said

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
rather slow as well so like I said

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.700 
rather slow as well so like I said
before<00:02:40.180> try<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.660> avoid<00:02:40.900> playing<00:02:41.200> aggressive

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
before try to avoid playing aggressive

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.380 
before try to avoid playing aggressive
