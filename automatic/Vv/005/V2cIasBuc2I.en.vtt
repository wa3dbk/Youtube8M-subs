break<00:03:45.680> in<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:45.920> little<00:03:46.190> bit<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.489> then<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.790> was<00:03:47.030> out

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
break in a little bit and then I was out

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.300

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
on the track all day long no problems at

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.309 
on the track all day long no problems at
all<00:03:49.370> totally<00:03:49.670> comfortable<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.870> think<00:03:51.139> the

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
all totally comfortable and I think the

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.500 
all totally comfortable and I think the
biggest<00:03:51.680> attribute<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:53.030> why<00:03:53.150> these<00:03:53.209> are<00:03:53.389> so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
biggest attribute for why these are so

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.720 
biggest attribute for why these are so
comfortable<00:03:53.780> is<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.560> leather<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.549> the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
comfortable is the leather is on the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.089 
comfortable is the leather is on the
palm<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.239> actually<00:03:56.750> kangaroo<00:03:57.260> skin<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:57.980> you've

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
palm is actually kangaroo skin so you've

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.039 
palm is actually kangaroo skin so you've
got<00:03:58.130> kangaroo<00:03:58.760> leather<00:03:58.790> that's<00:03:59.510> not<00:03:59.780> cheap

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
got kangaroo leather that's not cheap

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.140 
got kangaroo leather that's not cheap
guys<00:04:00.260> that's<00:04:00.500> expensive<00:04:00.950> leather<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.760> reason

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
guys that's expensive leather the reason

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.909 
guys that's expensive leather the reason
that<00:04:02.180> they<00:04:02.389> use<00:04:02.540> kangaroo<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.230> it's<00:04:03.650> more

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
that they use kangaroo is it's more

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.720 
that they use kangaroo is it's more
abrasion<00:04:04.760> resistant<00:04:05.480> for<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.019> for<00:04:06.410> a<00:04:06.440> thinner

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
abrasion resistant for the for a thinner

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.819 
abrasion resistant for the for a thinner
thickness<00:04:07.730> when<00:04:08.630> compared<00:04:09.019> to<00:04:09.079> cowhide<00:04:09.500> so

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
thickness when compared to cowhide so

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.979 
thickness when compared to cowhide so
that<00:04:10.310> gives<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.730> couple<00:04:11.060> things<00:04:11.269> first<00:04:11.780> of

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
that gives you a couple things first of

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.449 
that gives you a couple things first of
all<00:04:12.109> it<00:04:12.440> gives<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> glove<00:04:12.950> that's<00:04:13.099> a<00:04:13.220> little

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
abrasion resistance so very very

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.730 
abrasion resistance so very very
well-made<00:04:38.240> you'll<00:04:38.389> see<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.660> all<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.230> extra
