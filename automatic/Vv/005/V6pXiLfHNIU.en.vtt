00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
German counterparts but that's changed

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
important thing to look at is combined

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310

a slightly smaller rear legroom number
than<00:01:18.180> many<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> competition<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
than many of the competition but if you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
than many of the competition but if you
put<00:01:19.979> those<00:01:20.159> two<00:01:20.400> together<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> about

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
put those two together it's right about

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.240 
put those two together it's right about
the<00:01:21.420> same<00:01:21.600> size<00:01:21.810> as<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> B&amp;W<00:01:22.380> 3-series

the same size as the B&amp;W 3-series
that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.880> important<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> comes<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720

relatively upright position with the

relatively upright position with the

front seat in that position I can barely
install<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.630> rear-facing<00:01:36.960> child<00:01:37.290> seat<00:01:37.710> sitting

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
install a rear-facing child seat sitting

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
install a rear-facing child seat sitting
right<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.430> behind<00:01:38.759> myself<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.299> 6<00:01:39.689> feet<00:01:39.900> tall

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
right there behind myself at 6 feet tall

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.749 
right there behind myself at 6 feet tall
now<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.860> did<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.310> child<00:01:41.520> seat

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
now if I did have this child seat

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.219 
now if I did have this child seat
latched<00:01:42.030> into<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> vehicle<00:01:42.750> properly<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
latched into the vehicle properly it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.870 
latched into the vehicle properly it
would<00:01:43.320> move<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.890> bit<00:01:44.070> further<00:01:44.310> rearward

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
would move a little bit further rearward

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
would move a little bit further rearward
but<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> proper<00:01:46.350> angle<00:01:46.770> for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
but it is in the proper angle for

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
but it is in the proper angle for
installation<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.939> vehicle<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
installation in this vehicle the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.910 
installation in this vehicle the
takeaway<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
takeaway from this is that the is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
takeaway from this is that the is
performs<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.729> similarly<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> BMW

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
performs very similarly to the BMW

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
performs very similarly to the BMW
3-series<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.920> both<00:01:53.130> vehicles<00:01:53.399> have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
3-series because both vehicles have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
3-series because both vehicles have
about<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> same<00:01:54.450> amount<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> combined<00:01:55.259> rear

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
about the same amount of combined rear

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.709 
about the same amount of combined rear
legroom<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.520> you'll<00:01:56.640> definitely<00:01:57.060> find<00:01:57.210> more

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
legroom but you'll definitely find more

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.179 
legroom but you'll definitely find more
room<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.380> than<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.740> something<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
room in this than in something like a
