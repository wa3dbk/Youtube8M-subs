00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.539 
hipfire spread from our fast-paced
gameplay<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> reason<00:01:40.860> I've<00:01:40.950> chosen<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
gameplay and the reason I've chosen the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
gameplay and the reason I've chosen the
CBJ<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.329> particular<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
CBJ in particular is because it has the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.760 
CBJ in particular is because it has the
fastest<00:01:44.520> fire<00:01:44.790> rate<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> whole<00:01:45.420> game<00:01:45.770> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fastest fire rate in the whole game that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.020 
fastest fire rate in the whole game that
was<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> mouthful<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.399> fire<00:01:47.640> rate<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
was a mouthful really fire rate is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
was a mouthful really fire rate is
pretty<00:01:48.270> crazy<00:01:48.570> by<00:01:48.869> default<00:01:49.259> but<00:01:49.470> that's<00:01:49.649> not

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pretty crazy by default but that's not

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.770 
pretty crazy by default but that's not
enough<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.490> crank<00:01:50.880> head<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.570> we're<00:01:51.689> gonna

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
enough for a crank head so we're gonna

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
enough for a crank head so we're gonna
choose<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.140> rapid<00:01:52.740> fire<00:01:52.920> attachment<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
choose the rapid fire attachment to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.999 
choose the rapid fire attachment to
crank<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.570> fire<00:01:54.930> rate<00:01:55.170> from<00:01:55.409> 1,000

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
crank up that fire rate from 1,000

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.690 
crank up that fire rate from 1,000
rounds<00:01:56.159> per<00:01:56.369> minute<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> whopping<00:01:58.700> 1176

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
rounds per minute to a whopping 1176

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
rounds per minute to a whopping 1176
rounds<00:02:00.030> per<00:02:00.149> minute<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.780> does<00:02:00.960> no<00:02:01.079> favors<00:02:01.560> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
rounds per minute this does no favors to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.440 
rounds per minute this does no favors to
the<00:02:01.829> weapons<00:02:02.130> performance<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.880> already<00:02:03.210> got

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the weapons performance it's already got

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.510 
the weapons performance it's already got
pretty<00:02:03.719> crazy<00:02:04.110> recoil<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.310> damage

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
pretty crazy recoil and this damage

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
pretty crazy recoil and this damage
means<00:02:05.850> you're<00:02:06.000> gonna<00:02:06.090> need<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.450> six<00:02:06.930> shots

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
means you're gonna need up to six shots

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.440 
means you're gonna need up to six shots
to<00:02:07.409> kill<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.429> it's<00:02:08.580> great<00:02:08.789> fun<00:02:09.000> spewing

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to kill but it's great fun spewing

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.760 
to kill but it's great fun spewing
bullets<00:02:09.810> out<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.140> thing<00:02:10.379> when<00:02:10.590> you're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
bullets out of this thing when you're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.729 
bullets out of this thing when you're
cranked<00:02:11.310> up

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
cranked up

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.410 
cranked up
it's<00:02:12.010> as<00:02:12.159> if<00:02:12.280> someone's<00:02:12.579> just<00:02:12.790> pressed<00:02:13.090> fast

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
it's as if someone's just pressed fast

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.229 
it's as if someone's just pressed fast
forward<00:02:14.019> on<00:02:14.140> your<00:02:14.290> gameplay<00:02:14.849> your<00:02:15.849> rapid-fire

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
forward on your gameplay your rapid-fire

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.240 
forward on your gameplay your rapid-fire
attachment<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.930> CBJ<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.829> gonna<00:02:18.010> make<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
attachment on the CBJ is gonna make the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.890 
attachment on the CBJ is gonna make the
recoil<00:02:18.640> even<00:02:18.879> worse<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.390> we'll<00:02:19.540> go<00:02:19.689> with<00:02:19.719> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
recoil even worse so we'll go with the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.360 
recoil even worse so we'll go with the
grip<00:02:20.109> just<00:02:20.290> helped<00:02:20.680> aim<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.099> slightly

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
grip just helped aim it slightly

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.979 
grip just helped aim it slightly
although<00:02:22.209> you're<00:02:22.329> often<00:02:22.599> just<00:02:22.780> better<00:02:22.930> off

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
although you're often just better off

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.839 
although you're often just better off
spraying<00:02:23.500> from<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.859> hips<00:02:24.069> in<00:02:24.340> same<00:02:24.579> endow

sights<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.659> thing<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.079> often

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
sights with this thing just often

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.580 
sights with this thing just often
results<00:02:26.859> in<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.129> aiming<00:02:27.549> towards<00:02:27.969> the<00:02:28.090> clouds

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
results in you aiming towards the clouds

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.140 
results in you aiming towards the clouds
the<00:02:29.590> rest<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.889> the<00:02:29.980> setup<00:02:30.219> does<00:02:30.549> make<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> pretty

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the rest of the setup does make a pretty

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.270 
the rest of the setup does make a pretty
competitive<00:02:31.569> cranks<00:02:32.379> loadout<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.069> it's<00:02:33.219> only

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
competitive cranks loadout so it's only

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.449 
competitive cranks loadout so it's only
the<00:02:33.430> CBJ<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.420> kind<00:02:34.629> of<00:02:34.950> handicaps<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.159> so<00:02:36.340> if

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
the CBJ that kind of handicaps you so if

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.009 
the CBJ that kind of handicaps you so if
you're<00:02:36.579> looking<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.939> get<00:02:37.060> good<00:02:37.269> scores<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
you're looking to get good scores and I

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.509 
you're looking to get good scores and I
definitely<00:02:38.409> recommend<00:02:38.650> swapping<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.310> out

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
definitely recommend swapping this out

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.069 
definitely recommend swapping this out
for<00:02:39.849> any<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> assault<00:02:40.480> rifles

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
for any of the assault rifles

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.319 
for any of the assault rifles
maybe<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.799> F<00:02:42.069> ad<00:02:42.310> which<00:02:42.730> comes<00:02:42.969> along<00:02:43.120> with

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
maybe the F ad which comes along with

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.420 
maybe the F ad which comes along with
quite<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.569> high<00:02:43.810> fire<00:02:44.169> rate<00:02:44.409> but<00:02:44.919> is<00:02:45.040> much<00:02:45.159> more

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
quite a high fire rate but is much more

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.250 
quite a high fire rate but is much more
