quite<00:04:24.130> genius<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.729> they've<00:04:25.180> created<00:04:25.390> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
quite genius and they've created a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.130 
quite genius and they've created a
tripod<00:04:26.290> mount<00:04:26.560> system<00:04:27.270> where<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.479> strap<00:04:28.870> of

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
tripod mount system where the strap of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.020 
tripod mount system where the strap of
the<00:04:29.229> camera<00:04:29.590> actually<00:04:30.070> hooks<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.550> way<00:04:30.820> down

the camera actually hooks on way down

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.420 
the camera actually hooks on way down
here<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:32.229> basically<00:04:32.650> what<00:04:32.890> you're<00:04:32.979> doing<00:04:33.310> is

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
here so basically what you're doing is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.010 
here so basically what you're doing is
you're<00:04:33.580> attaching<00:04:34.060> their<00:04:34.210> mounting<00:04:34.660> system

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
you're attaching their mounting system

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.830 
you're attaching their mounting system
with<00:04:35.140> just<00:04:35.440> this<00:04:35.560> hard<00:04:35.860> aluminum<00:04:36.490> that's<00:04:37.390> also

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
with just this hard aluminum that's also

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.290 
with just this hard aluminum that's also
quite<00:04:38.050> light<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.560> very<00:04:39.430> sturdy<00:04:39.850> you're

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
quite light and very sturdy you're

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.570 
quite light and very sturdy you're

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
like I've done here

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.080 
like I've done here

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
caused a problem at all because you can

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.930 
caused a problem at all because you can
take<00:04:50.600> your<00:04:50.750> tripod<00:04:51.050> quick-release<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.130> you

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
can lock that right on to the bottom of

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.070 
can lock that right on to the bottom of
their<00:04:55.970> mounting<00:04:56.480> system<00:04:56.840> so<00:04:56.960> you<00:04:57.050> can

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
their mounting system so you can

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.500 
their mounting system so you can
basically<00:04:57.290> double<00:04:57.920> up<00:04:58.070> your<00:04:58.220> mount<00:04:58.520> which
