 produced in artisanal conditions 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.040
 this can be judged by the number was 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.320
 together installation booze 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.930
 however the particulate filter was programs on 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.460
 remote system at the moment 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.780
 is straight durable 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:32.080
 its resonator is cut out from the exhaust 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.259
 systems give flange mounting 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.259
 particulate filter 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.930
 cuts the pipe behind the particulate filter and 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.860
 particulate filter remove remove sensor 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.860

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.600
 also given a shock mount 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.580
 suspension and front of the hardware 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.980
 systems with gopro extracted and a tooth for wife 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:15.260
 diesel particulate filter cut off the van and 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.260
 fasteners make repair pipe 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.849
 it will connect the flute with the pipe 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.689
 catalyst pipe debi firm bang bye 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.689
 bend 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.160
 then distribute according to 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.700
 diameter and paid system try on 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.700
 regular place 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 then it is welded to the corrugation 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.130
 type interlock three-layer internal 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.750

 yoke 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.300
 again on pipe benders made 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.490
 repair pipe this pipe 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:28.400
 will be connected to part of the old 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:35.840
 exhaust pipe and connect flame arrester 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:40.610
 with corrugation pipe installed on the staff 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:48.650
 place is fixed by welding sets 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:53.600
 sensor lawn yes to the nozzle 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.330
 weld the flange mounting pipe 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.020
 with flange mounted on flame arrester 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.020
 sprint junction boil 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.629
 then the flame arrester are set to 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.719
 regular place going flange 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.719
 compound

 flame arrester coupling 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:34.460
 welded to the back of the exhaust 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:39.110
 system and so installed a new corrugation 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.110
 flame arrester and connecting pipes 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.889
 welding places paint heat resistant 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.889
 paint 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.700
 repair is over warranty on everything 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.840
 work performed and installed 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.840
