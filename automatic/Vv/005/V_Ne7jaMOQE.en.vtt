00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
then we're going to scroll down to

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
then we're going to scroll down to
accessibility<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.990> from<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.070> we're<00:00:32.160> going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
accessibility and from here we're going

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
accessibility and from here we're going
to<00:00:32.309> pretty<00:00:32.489> much<00:00:32.579> scroll<00:00:33.000> down<00:00:33.180> all<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> way

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
to pretty much scroll down all the way

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
to pretty much scroll down all the way
to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.079> bottom<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> find

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to the bottom and you want to find

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.850 
to the bottom and you want to find
assistive<00:00:36.059> touch<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.290> we'll<00:00:37.410> open<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.800> up

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
assistive touch so we'll open that up

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.950 
assistive touch so we'll open that up
and<00:00:38.219> we'll<00:00:38.399> turn<00:00:38.579> assistive<00:00:39.149> touch<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and we'll turn assistive touch on and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
and we'll turn assistive touch on and
basically<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> create<00:00:41.489> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
basically this is going to create this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
basically this is going to create this
sort<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> digital<00:00:42.540> button<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sort of like a digital button here and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770 
sort of like a digital button here and
this<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.129> various<00:00:44.730> things<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.300> showed<00:00:45.629> you
