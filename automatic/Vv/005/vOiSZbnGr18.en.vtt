00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.759 

not<00:03:12.120> bad<00:03:12.360> at<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.019> 42<00:03:13.409> grams<00:03:13.590> of

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
not bad at all and this is 42 grams of

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.430 
not bad at all and this is 42 grams of
protein<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.269> not<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.599> best<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:16.080> flavors

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
protein it is not the best of flavors

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.039 
protein it is not the best of flavors
guys<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:17.010> not<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:18.299> me<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.690> tastes<00:03:18.900> like

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
guys it's not to me what it tastes like

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.990 
guys it's not to me what it tastes like
is<00:03:21.080> kool<00:03:22.080> aid<00:03:22.290> that's<00:03:22.860> missing<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.519> little<00:03:23.879> bit

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
is kool aid that's missing a little bit

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720 
is kool aid that's missing a little bit
of<00:03:24.090> sugar<00:03:24.269> I<00:03:24.620> think<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.860> added<00:03:26.129> one<00:03:26.459> like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
of sugar I think if you added one like

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.670 
of sugar I think if you added one like
pack<00:03:27.150> splenda<00:03:27.659> packet<00:03:28.019> or<00:03:28.079> something<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.560> is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
pack splenda packet or something that is

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.100 
pack splenda packet or something that is
it<00:03:28.829> be<00:03:28.950> perfect<00:03:29.430> because<00:03:30.269> it<00:03:30.540> does<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:30.900> like

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
it be perfect because it does have like

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.020 
it be perfect because it does have like
a<00:03:31.140> little<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.829> tastes<00:03:32.489> like<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.790> needs<00:03:32.970> a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
a little it tastes like it needs a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.270 
a little it tastes like it needs a
little<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.299> sugar<00:03:33.680> which<00:03:34.680> by<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> way<00:03:35.040> these

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
little more sugar which by the way these

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.740 
little more sugar which by the way these
have<00:03:35.489> no<00:03:35.670> sugar<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.060> them<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.450> could<00:03:36.720> be

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
have no sugar in them so that could be

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.559 
have no sugar in them so that could be
why<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.010> doesn't<00:03:38.370> taste<00:03:38.519> bad<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:39.360> really

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
why but it doesn't taste bad it really

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.580 
why but it doesn't taste bad it really
doesn't<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:43.190> will<00:03:44.190> finish<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
doesn't I will finish this and the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.110 
doesn't I will finish this and the
reason<00:03:46.620> why<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:47.340> going<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.640> put<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
reason why I was going to put this in a

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.759 
reason why I was going to put this in a
crystal<00:03:48.510> light<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.079> thought<00:03:49.379> it<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.590> be

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
crystal light but I thought it would be

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.030 
crystal light but I thought it would be
too<00:03:49.980> sweet<00:03:50.190> but<00:03:51.260> being<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:53.010> a

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
too sweet but being that this is not a

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.069 
too sweet but being that this is not a
sweet<00:03:53.370> flavor<00:03:53.519> at<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.299> think<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.930> would<00:03:55.049> be

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
sweet flavor at all I think it would be

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.009 
sweet flavor at all I think it would be
perfect<00:03:55.709> in<00:03:55.890> Crystal<00:03:56.250> Light<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:57.019> crystallite

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
perfect in Crystal Light a crystallite

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.949 
perfect in Crystal Light a crystallite
