home and it didn't work I don't really

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
home and it didn't work I don't really
care<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.300> need<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.690> LED<00:00:52.110> light

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140

on<00:00:52.469> my<00:00:52.620> magnifying<00:00:53.129> glass<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:54.570> you're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
on my magnifying glass but if you're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
on my magnifying glass but if you're
going<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.829> reading<00:00:56.190> or

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
going to use this for reading or

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.959 
going to use this for reading or
something<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> guess<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.840> might<00:00:57.989> be

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
something I guess that might be

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
something I guess that might be
unfortunate<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.559> pick<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
