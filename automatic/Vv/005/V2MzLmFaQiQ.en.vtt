 that you also know your part jaua 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.309

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 Carlos Caves is a criminalist 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.090
 has made it possible to identify people 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.910
 thanks to its physical characteristics 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.590
 they say a lot about a person in the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.690
 conference that we are going to impart 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.060
 We are talking about looking for the face 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.800
 of an aggressor as we are going to give

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 imaginary line at the tip and they 're going to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.890
 cross are going to cross then in the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.780
 moment that those eyebrows intersect there is a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 character clash then that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.649
 Although rooted aggressiveness person 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.480
 even if it manifests with us from 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.980
 very simple way very quiet going to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.920
 arrive the moment that person goes 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
 to explode in the eyebrows version in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 that shape in horizontal shape with fall 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 of sentimentality tells us a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.800
 quiet person very sentimental a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.050
 person who can break into tears very 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
 easily but also the movements 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.050
 bodily they also say a lot about one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.070
 same 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.810
 and gesticulate if you raise your eyebrows 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.640
 that information is these lines 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 horizontals that are marked me is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.520

 techniques applied by life coaching 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.760

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 character temperament and way of being of 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.750
 a person with the other two 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 very powerful tools that we are 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.710
 trying to combine here and give the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.530
