this vehicle has been totally redesigned

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.929 
this vehicle has been totally redesigned
BMW<00:00:19.350> made<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:20.010> lighter<00:00:20.930> larger<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> longer

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
BMW made it lighter larger and longer

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.330 
BMW made it lighter larger and longer
it's<00:00:23.939> also<00:00:24.439> more<00:00:25.439> fuel<00:00:25.710> efficient<00:00:26.160> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
it's also more fuel efficient so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
it's also more fuel efficient so
basically<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.060> were<00:00:27.119> trying<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
basically what they were trying to do is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.099 
basically what they were trying to do is
to<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:29.359> everything<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.050> about

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to take everything that was good about

the daily driver the first thing you're

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
the daily driver the first thing you're
going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> notice<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> 2012<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
going to notice on the 2012 on the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.209 
going to notice on the 2012 on the
difference<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.520> low<00:00:47.700> slung<00:00:48.059> hood<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
difference is the low slung hood and in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
difference is the low slung hood and in
the<00:00:50.309> whole<00:00:50.460> front<00:00:50.760> fascia<00:00:51.000> giving<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the whole front fascia giving it a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.770 
the whole front fascia giving it a
little<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.170> more<00:00:52.410> aerodynamic<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.629> other

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
little bit more aerodynamic the other

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
little bit more aerodynamic the other
feature<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.350> you'll<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.160> you've

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
feature that you'll see is that you've

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
feature that you'll see is that you've
got<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> lot<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.760> surface<00:00:57.329> area<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.899> your

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
got a lot more surface area on your

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.580 
got a lot more surface area on your
light<00:00:58.640> obviously<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> safety<00:01:00.539> feature<00:01:00.690> when

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
light obviously a safety feature when

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.080 
light obviously a safety feature when
driving<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:02.010> night<00:01:02.629> one<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.129> I<00:01:05.129> think<00:01:05.970> one

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
driving at night one of the I think one

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
driving at night one of the I think one
of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> best<00:01:06.360> feats<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.080> did<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
of the best feats that they did on this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.380 
of the best feats that they did on this
vehicle<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:09.560> changed<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> engine<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.640> 328

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
vehicle was changed the engine the 328

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
vehicle was changed the engine the 328
starting<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> 2012<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.549> comes<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> four

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
but it's the first time I've seen BMW

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.220 
but it's the first time I've seen BMW
actually<00:06:19.370> put<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.850> different<00:06:20.090> color<00:06:20.540> on<00:06:21.020> the

dashboard and on the steering wheel i

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.340 
dashboard and on the steering wheel i
when<00:06:26.300> i<00:06:26.330> looked<00:06:26.600> at<00:06:26.720> this<00:06:26.840> i<00:06:27.020> first<00:06:27.260> thought

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
when i looked at this i first thought

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.960 
when i looked at this i first thought
okay<00:06:27.740> what<00:06:27.920> would<00:06:28.040> this<00:06:28.190> be<00:06:28.400> good<00:06:28.610> for<00:06:28.850> well

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
okay what would this be good for well

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.190 
okay what would this be good for well
first<00:06:29.150> of<00:06:29.270> all<00:06:29.300> it<00:06:29.450> looks<00:06:29.720> great

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
first of all it looks great

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.530 
first of all it looks great
second<00:06:31.070> of<00:06:31.160> all<00:06:31.280> in<00:06:31.520> the<00:06:31.700> hot<00:06:31.850> summer<00:06:32.210> heat

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.200 
second of all in the hot summer heat
this<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:34.040> probably<00:06:34.400> going<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:34.670> be<00:06:34.850> at<00:06:34.970> least

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
this is probably going to be at least

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.110 
this is probably going to be at least
fifty<00:06:35.630> degrees<00:06:35.960> cooler<00:06:36.650> than<00:06:37.040> than<00:06:37.730> an<00:06:37.850> actual
