unusually<00:00:41.879> sturdy<00:00:42.239> heavy<00:00:42.600> cardboard<00:00:44.000> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
unusually sturdy heavy cardboard much

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
unusually sturdy heavy cardboard much
higher<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> pound

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
higher you know pound

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.540 
higher you know pound
however<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.550> rate<00:00:47.700> cardboard<00:00:49.129> that's<00:00:50.129> kind

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
however they rate cardboard that's kind

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.139 
however they rate cardboard that's kind
of<00:00:50.610> nice<00:00:53.210> yeah<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.570> instruction<00:00:55.320> sheet

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.450 

painting<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.270> marking<00:01:00.390> guide<00:01:01.340> looks<00:01:02.340> like

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
painting and marking guide looks like

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.170 
painting and marking guide looks like
there's<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.879> variants<00:01:03.680> both<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> these<00:01:05.150> no<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there's two variants both of these no I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
there's two variants both of these no I
take<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.200> Spanish

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
take that back there's one Spanish

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
take that back there's one Spanish
variant<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> guess<00:01:08.790> I'd<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.740> honest<00:01:10.740> no<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
variant so I guess I'd be honest no that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.320 
variant so I guess I'd be honest no that
wouldn't<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.369> Condor<00:01:11.790> Legion<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.150> would

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
wouldn't be Condor Legion that would

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.719 
wouldn't be Condor Legion that would
have<00:01:12.420> been<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> German<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.700> have

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have been the German so this would have

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.390 
have been the German so this would have
been<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> Soviet<00:01:17.479> leased<00:01:18.479> vehicle<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> guess<00:01:19.400> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
been a Soviet leased vehicle I guess so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
been a Soviet leased vehicle I guess so
there's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> Spanish<00:01:20.909> version<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
there's a Spanish version and then a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
there's a Spanish version and then a
Russian<00:01:22.619> version<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.009> guess<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.460> be

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Russian version I guess this would be

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.840 
Russian version I guess this would be
pre-war<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:25.530> course<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.009> speak<00:01:26.310> know

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pre-war of course I don't speak know

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.310 
pre-war of course I don't speak know
that<00:01:27.060> looks<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.360> Spanish<00:01:27.720> -<00:01:27.869> looks<00:01:28.080> maybe

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that looks like Spanish - looks maybe

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.590 
that looks like Spanish - looks maybe
better<00:01:28.590> both<00:01:28.829> Spanish<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> instruction<00:01:31.860> sheet

comes with a jig and then the individual
track<00:02:12.410> pins<00:02:12.739> let<00:02:13.430> me<00:02:13.520> hold<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.790> up<00:02:14.030> for<00:02:14.239> you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
track pins let me hold that up for you

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.949 
track pins let me hold that up for you
you<00:02:15.970> actually<00:02:16.970> cut<00:02:17.150> these<00:02:17.270> little<00:02:17.510> pins<00:02:17.750> off

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
you actually cut these little pins off

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.470 
you actually cut these little pins off
and<00:02:18.319> then<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.560> insert<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.280> pin<00:02:19.819> on<00:02:19.849> each<00:02:20.180> side

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and then you insert a pin on each side

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
and then you insert a pin on each side
of<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.690> track<00:02:20.900> link<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.040> that's<00:02:22.459> not<00:02:22.640> too<00:02:22.790> bad

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
of the track link so that's not too bad

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.259 
of the track link so that's not too bad
and<00:02:23.300> just<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> trumpeter<00:02:25.760> kits<00:02:26.030> there's

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
and just like the trumpeter kits there's

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.160 
and just like the trumpeter kits there's
a<00:02:26.330> separate<00:02:26.660> compartment<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.470> hole<00:02:27.680> and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
a separate compartment for the hole and

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.020 
a separate compartment for the hole and
really<00:02:30.170> super-nice<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:31.130> don<00:02:31.250> t<00:02:31.280> see<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.700> or<00:02:31.880> not

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
really super-nice I don t see it or not

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.960 
really super-nice I don t see it or not
super<00:02:32.930> nice<00:02:33.080> rivet<00:02:33.650> detail<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:37.489> course<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:37.880> a

there's the decals sheet and of course

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.720 
there's the decals sheet and of course
it<00:02:59.840> obviously<00:03:00.500> that's<00:03:00.799> going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> correspond

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
it obviously that's going to correspond

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
kind of interesting and there's a really

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
kind of interesting and there's a really
delicate<00:04:41.070> injection<00:04:41.850> molded<00:04:42.180> antenna<00:04:42.660> inside
