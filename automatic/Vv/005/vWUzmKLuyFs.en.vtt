contacts<00:00:30.269> were<00:00:30.539> taken<00:00:31.140> off<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.679> organ<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
contacts were taken off of the organ and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.479 
contacts were taken off of the organ and
an<00:00:32.910> anti<00:00:33.329> latch<00:00:33.660> mechanism<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.829> installed<00:00:35.309> in

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
an anti latch mechanism was installed in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.389 
an anti latch mechanism was installed in

them art III s and D 100 Hammonds have a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.750 
them art III s and D 100 Hammonds have a
nasty<00:00:38.879> habit<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.579> depress<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
nasty habit where if you depress the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.490 
nasty habit where if you depress the
pedal<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.360> quickly<00:00:42.719> or<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> lot<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
pedal very quickly or with a lot of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
pedal very quickly or with a lot of
force<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.670> contacts<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.539> actually

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
force the contacts can actually

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
force the contacts can actually
overshoot<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> bus<00:00:46.920> bars<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.640> latch

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
overshoot the bus bars and then latch

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.660 
overshoot the bus bars and then latch
underneath<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.190> happens

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
underneath them and when that happens

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
underneath them and when that happens
the<00:00:50.820> contacts<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.600> been<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> bus<00:00:52.379> bars

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
the contacts get been to the bus bars

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.150 
the contacts get been to the bus bars
can<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.070> destroyed<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.829> stuck

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
can get destroyed and you have stuck

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.150 
can get destroyed and you have stuck
notes<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> pedals<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.120> don't<00:00:57.480> stop<00:00:57.780> playing

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
notes and pedals that don't stop playing

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
notes and pedals that don't stop playing
that<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> case<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> organ<00:01:00.600> when

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that was the case with this organ when

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
that was the case with this organ when
it<00:01:00.870> came<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> wires<00:01:02.129> were<00:01:02.430> cut

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it came in here but the wires were cut

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.179 
it came in here but the wires were cut
so<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> pedals<00:01:03.510> wouldn't<00:01:03.840> sound<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:05.040> any

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so that the pedals wouldn't sound in any

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
so that the pedals wouldn't sound in any
case<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.900> had<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> trek<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.380> pedal<00:01:08.330> anti<00:01:09.330> latch

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
case we had the trek to pedal anti latch

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.320 
case we had the trek to pedal anti latch
upgrade<00:01:10.439> installed<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> pedal

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
upgrade installed or the or the pedal

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
upgrade installed or the or the pedal
Jam<00:01:12.810> preventer<00:01:13.409> kit<00:01:14.000> which<00:01:15.000> adds<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.810> plate<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Jam preventer kit which adds a plate of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.100 
Jam preventer kit which adds a plate of
metal<00:01:16.680> underneath<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.340> pedal<00:01:17.640> actuators<00:01:18.390> so

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
metal underneath the pedal actuators so

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
metal underneath the pedal actuators so
that<00:01:19.290> went<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.830> they<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.159> pressed<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.790> force

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that went if they are pressed with force

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.749 
that went if they are pressed with force
they<00:01:21.960> can't<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.650> bottomed<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> they

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
they can't they bottomed out and they

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270 
they can't they bottomed out and they
can't<00:01:24.030> go<00:01:24.270> beyond<00:01:24.659> their<00:01:24.990> intended<00:01:25.680> distance

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
can't go beyond their intended distance

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
can't go beyond their intended distance
therefore<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.750> problem<00:01:28.049> will<00:01:28.290> not

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
therefore that this problem will not

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.950 
therefore that this problem will not
happen<00:01:28.680> again

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
happen again

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.690 
happen again
again<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.259> only<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.770> problem<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
again this is only a problem for the

not flash out in addition you may
remember<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> lot<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.720> missing

remember that we had a lot of missing

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.300 
remember that we had a lot of missing
tones<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> manuals<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.860> after<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:55.979> opened

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
tones on the manuals and after we opened

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
tones on the manuals and after we opened
up<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> manuals<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.060> took<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> look<00:01:57.540> it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
up the manuals and took a look it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.740 
up the manuals and took a look it
actually<00:01:58.350> ended<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> where<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:59.009> needed<00:01:59.219> to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
actually ended up where we needed to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
actually ended up where we needed to
replace<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.049> manuals<00:02:01.469> completely<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> this

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
replace the manuals completely in this

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.600 
replace the manuals completely in this
instrument<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:04.140> bus<00:02:04.350> bars<00:02:04.649> were<00:02:04.950> had<00:02:05.250> gotten

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
instrument the bus bars were had gotten

the in the manuals basically destroying
the<00:02:28.800> keyboard<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.090> only<00:02:30.300> did<00:02:30.450> we<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.690> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the keyboard so not only did we have a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.420 
the keyboard so not only did we have a
lot<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:30.990> broken<00:02:31.410> wires<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.220> foam<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:34.430> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
lot of broken wires and foam and you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.880 
lot of broken wires and foam and you
know<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.760> bad<00:02:35.940> busbars<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.870> also<00:02:37.020> had<00:02:37.350> key

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
know and bad busbars but we also had key

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.340 
know and bad busbars but we also had key
contacts<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.610> were<00:02:38.730> also<00:02:38.910> bad<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.720> opted

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
contacts that were also bad so we opted

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.410 
contacts that were also bad so we opted
instead<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.800> replace<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> manuals<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.300> this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
instead to replace the manuals in this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.490 
instead to replace the manuals in this
organ<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:42.960> a<00:02:42.990> set<00:02:43.920> from<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.250> donor<00:02:44.460> instrument

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
organ with a set from a donor instrument

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.760 
organ with a set from a donor instrument
so<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.890> was<00:02:47.580> done<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.750> original<00:02:49.200> keys<00:02:49.500> are

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
so that was done the original keys are

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.380 
so that was done the original keys are
still<00:02:50.010> being<00:02:50.250> returned<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.850> customer<00:02:51.240> as

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
still being returned to the customer as

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.640 
still being returned to the customer as
well<00:02:51.420> as<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> key<00:02:51.930> combs<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.470> they<00:02:52.590> were

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
well as the key combs because they were

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.420 
well as the key combs because they were
in<00:02:52.860> very<00:02:52.980> very<00:02:53.250> good<00:02:53.370> shape<00:02:54.860> we<00:02:55.860> rebuilt<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
in very very good shape we rebuilt the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.570 
in very very good shape we rebuilt the
drawbar<00:02:56.910> assembly<00:02:57.709> clean<00:02:58.709> all<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.280> switch

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
drawbar assembly clean all the switch

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.199 
drawbar assembly clean all the switch
tablets<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.480> controls<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.490> now<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.550> organ<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
tablets and controls so now the organ is

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.350 
tablets and controls so now the organ is
very<00:03:03.660> quiet<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.700> everything<00:03:05.700> operates<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
very quiet and everything operates the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.290 
very quiet and everything operates the
way<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.600> should<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.610> I'll<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.940> play<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.209> little

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
way it should so I'll just play a little

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.900 
way it should so I'll just play a little
bit<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.140> am<00:03:10.260> NOT<00:03:10.410> an<00:03:10.530> organist<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.340> you'll

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
bit and I am NOT an organist so you'll

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.620 
bit and I am NOT an organist so you'll
have<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.300> excuse<00:03:13.050> my<00:03:13.640> ability<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.120> here

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
have to excuse my ability here but here

00:03:15.630 --> 00:04:22.850

so<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.370> kind<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.700> sums<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.120> up<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.680> we're<00:04:26.680> off

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
so that kind of sums it up and we're off

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.560 
so that kind of sums it up and we're off
to<00:04:26.890> return<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.550> to<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.730> customer<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.360> will
