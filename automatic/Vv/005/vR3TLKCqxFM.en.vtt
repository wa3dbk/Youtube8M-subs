00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.820
 the most important thing to have a dog 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.370
 balanced and enjoy it during 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.770
 all his life that are 15 years is that 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.770
 when you call, go to the call and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:27.900
 here he lives here and here and does very well and 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.900
 You can also save your life 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.940
 the first thing that should be done so that 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
 a dog when you call him come to you very 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.699
 quickly is that I associate the word 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.590
 here with a little bit of food and so 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.920
 we condition the word here here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.930
 here here here and here here with 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.110
 give him a little bit of food here here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110
 here 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.610
 when the dog approaches you is 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.320
 always very relaxed very friendly with 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.580
 them because the arrival to you and the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.760
 arrival to the human has to be always 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.409
 the best for your life and the more 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.240
 let's condition our dog with the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.760
 word here here here more food 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 we will obtain in the long run very good 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 results and this that I just 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.720
 explain is only the first step 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.479
 the world of the dog is based on the smells 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.979
 in the chemicals is very 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.560
 possible that the dog when we call him 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.909
 do not go to our call for that now 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.909
 let's see the second step 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 to perfect the call in the case 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.409
 in which the dog does not come is very 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.829
 important to use a string of more than 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.829
 7 meters 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.850
 let's try it here here and here towards 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.970
 Here very well 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.259
 we put it on and let the dog 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.259
 smell the environment 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.690
 and we call it here and here here if not 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.490
 come help her with the army here 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.709
 here we help you with the rope in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.300
 the moment the dog calls him and he 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.970
 go to the opposite side simply 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.819
 we will help you with a light touch of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.989
 belts directing you towards us here 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.989
 here here here here here 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.049
 Y 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 She says yes to what good 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.500
 and the most important thing to have a dog 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.240
 balanced is to walk every day and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.010
 if the dog directs the walk it will be 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.790
 impossible to come to our call 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.790
 here 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.940
 once the dog is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.100
 conditioned with food and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.830
 conditioned with the rope I'm going to 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.840
 teach what a balanced dog is 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.980
 it's a dog that goes to the call to the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.550
 first 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.550
 or not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.270
 and it's very important when it comes to going out 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.320
 walk that the one that is always very 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.610
 quiet and nothing excited do not go out to 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.610
 the war we went for a walk 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.290
 we can allow the dog to get away 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.420
 about 10-15 meters but not much more and 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.750
 whenever we call him he always has 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750
 to come 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.560
 here here so here here here returns 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.890
 they are all defects 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.920
 you see this is a true dog 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.840
 balanced does not separate very much from me 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.209
 I can allow it to separate a little 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.310
 but not too much and there's the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.430
 balance very well you can see his face 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.430
 of happiness 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.879
 and of course play a little bit with 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.879
 they 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.120
 I like to bring dogs to this area 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.430
 because they get tired a lot more since it is 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.620
 a beaten earth ' and what he's going to do 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.840
 is that the dog 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.669
 since much more muscle and dry 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.740
 much more because he has to do a lot 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:40.180
 more strength when walking and much more to 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.180
 run we go up 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.630
 and of course the ball at the end 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.810
 it's always mine 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 a tired dog is a balanced dog 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.460
 never forget for the children I love 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.460
 guys, let's go guys 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.340
 If you do not want your dog to be a 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.229
 slave belt and also power 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.330
 let go to enjoy more of the 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.820
 walks is very important to be addressed 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.440
 jce to make the call to perception 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.729
 provide in your food and a little bit of 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.729
 water that simple
