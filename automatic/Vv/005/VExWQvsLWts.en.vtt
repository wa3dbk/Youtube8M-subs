there are that's the plant designation

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.299 
there are that's the plant designation
they<00:00:46.230> were<00:00:46.289> pumping<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.890> things<00:00:47.129> out

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
they were pumping these things out

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
they were pumping these things out
pretty<00:00:47.579> heavy<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> 60s<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.200> they

digit that's the body style in this case

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
digit that's the body style in this case
that<00:01:01.800> would<00:01:01.980> mean<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.579> fastback<00:01:03.090> fifth

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that would mean it's a fastback fifth

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.690 
that would mean it's a fastback fifth
digit<00:01:04.350> real<00:01:04.650> important<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.280> that's<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
digit real important one that's the
engine<00:01:06.150> code<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.110> must<00:01:07.350> look<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
engine code you must look at that one in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
engine code you must look at that one in
this<00:01:08.400> case<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.030> T<00:01:09.270> meaning<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> thing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
this case it's a T meaning this thing

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
this case it's a T meaning this thing
was<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> six<00:01:10.890> cylinder<00:01:11.070> car<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.640> these<00:01:12.330> last
