think<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.590> client<00:00:47.190> think<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> me

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
think of me as your client think of me

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.279 
think of me as your client think of me
as<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.930> team<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> first<00:00:54.750> point<00:00:55.140> of

as one of your team the first point of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
as one of your team the first point of
reference<00:00:55.530> i<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.309> steve<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
reference i think for steve was the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.069 
reference i think for steve was the
campus<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.710> Stanford<00:00:59.370> his<00:01:00.180> home<00:01:00.480> territory

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
campus at Stanford his home territory

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.670 
campus at Stanford his home territory
and<00:01:01.579> also<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.000> landscape<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.439> grew<00:01:04.650> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
and also the landscape that he grew up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
and also the landscape that he grew up
he<00:01:05.400> still<00:01:05.670> remembered<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.780> fruit<00:01:07.049> bowl

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
he still remembered it as the fruit bowl

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
he still remembered it as the fruit bowl
of<00:01:07.590> America<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.650> idea<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> bring

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of America the idea is to bring

them<00:01:38.829> with<00:01:39.310> even<00:01:39.789> more<00:01:40.000> resilient<00:01:40.840> species

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
them with even more resilient species

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.499 
them with even more resilient species
such<00:01:41.829> as<00:01:41.860> folks<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.670> are<00:01:42.759> well<00:01:42.909> adapted<00:01:43.210> to
