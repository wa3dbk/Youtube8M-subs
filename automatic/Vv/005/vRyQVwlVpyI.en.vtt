00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520 
big gun and I'm only prioritizing to 704
in<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> minute<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.649> he<00:01:02.129> has<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.600> most

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
in a minute because he has the most

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.550 
in a minute because he has the most
dangerous<00:01:05.010> gun<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.290> other

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
dangerous gun and I know that the other

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
dangerous gun and I know that the other
tanks<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.220> them<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.119> able<00:01:09.240> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
tanks for them will not be able to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.590 
tanks for them will not be able to
penetrate<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.080> STI<00:01:10.439> frontally<00:01:11.159> her<00:01:12.150> mangled

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
penetrate the STI frontally her mangled

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.530 
penetrate the STI frontally her mangled
because<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.409> thought<00:01:13.909> 225<00:01:14.909> millimeters<00:01:15.420> at

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
because they thought 225 millimeters at

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.880 
because they thought 225 millimeters at
the<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.110> penetration<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.750> yeah<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.530> what

more<00:04:46.910> considering<00:04:47.570> health<00:04:48.200> if<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.560> tanks<00:04:48.890> I

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
more considering health if the tanks I

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.600
