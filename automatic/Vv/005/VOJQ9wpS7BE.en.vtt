00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi everyone how are you in the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.420
 today's video I will teach how they are made 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.300
 these necks bibs or necks of peter 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.340
 bread is a super simple craft and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.040
 I personally is a complement that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.619
 I love it because it serves to convert 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 Any shirt or dress shirt 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 simple that we have in an outfit of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 party or good at least helps 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.900
 turn it into a party weekend and you're going to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 see that it's super simple that you can 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 customize in any way if we 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 like glitter you can do it with 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.180
 pebbles or even tacks and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.950
 Well that everyone you can 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.680
 customize to your own taste 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.660
 another good thing that this necklace has is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 which is very fast to do so if 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.070
 you have to do for example a gift 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 of invisible friend- so last minute and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.329
 you do not know what to give then if the girl 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 in question he likes the complements 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 of this type because you can invent a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 collar a custom bib necklace 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.469
 for her I love that about 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.910
 gift handmade things and especially 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.830
 if I know that the other person has done it 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.690
 thinking about my customized for me 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.370
 it gives me according to a necklace of facts 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 I would be very excited if I 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.930
 I want to see how I measure this necklace 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.810
 he has downloaded the tutorial 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.360
 for this day and cool you're going to need a 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.540
 piece of felt of any color 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.800
 scissors glue a tie brush 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.270
 Glitter counts up soles or 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 anything else that you want 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.200
 decorate your neck 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.289
 will also need a pattern to 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.960
 the neck and I did mine with 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.789
 photoshop and then I printed it and good 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.679
 although in reality they are not necessary 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.539
 two halves so saying is not necessary 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.340
 print the two halves I wanted 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.109
 do it like this to get an idea of 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.840
 how was the necklace going to be after 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.869
 finish it if you want you can make a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.429
 larger pattern or a smaller one and 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.429
 that already depends on the taste of each 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.579
 one but if you want to use this one 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.630
 I leave the link to the site where 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.630
 you can download in my blog 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.390
 now let's take our piece of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.400
 felt 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.400
 we're going to fold it in half 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.260
 and we are going to take 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.060
 the pattern that we have cut out 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.060
 we are going to put here on the felt 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.420
 and let's draw with what we have 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.780
 I think a highlighter a milestone for 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.780
 fabric that would be ideal the outline of the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.040
 once we have finished the outline 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.910
 we removed the template 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.290
 and now we are ready to 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.290
 with the fabric 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.000
 once I have it so folded by the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:11.170
 half 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:13.300
 Well, I'm going to start recovering once 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.350
 that we have our collar trimmed what 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.550
 we put on a paper surface not 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.709
 I recommend you do it on the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.459
 table because if you are going to use glitter 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.810
 glue and materials well first if I 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.560
 The best protect the table so that 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.380
 finish 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.690
 elsa powder 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.080
 Now I'm going to take my fabric glue 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.650
 and I'm going to fill one of the halves of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.650
 glue 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.410
 and with my little pin 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.410
 well I will cover well whole 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.060
 Now let's take our purpurina 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.060
 and let's throw it over 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.570
 and I will very generously apply 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:21.129
 making sure 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.730
 as we commented at the beginning of the video 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.760
 You can do this craft with 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.560
 little stones with studs with beads 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.060
 with what you can think of if you are going to 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.770
 do with something other than glitter 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.050
 and I advise you not to buy this 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.450
 glue this is what I bought myself in 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.640
 eroski that he put that was for textiles and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.320
 good is good for pasting cloth with fabric or 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.290
 for example something finite like 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.690
 glitter but it really is very difficult 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.170
 hit something a little heavier so 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.120
 if you want to stick pebbles or pearls 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.100
 I advise you to buy a 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.080
 Waterman glue that is ideal for 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.150
 all this kind of crafts what 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.400
 It happens that I would say that I went to the store 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.280
 to buy the materials because they did not have 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.220
 that's why I went to eroski and I bought the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.410
 I found that it was this but good and 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.850
 I tell you if you want to hit pebbles 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.370
 you're going to need something a little bit more 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.130
 strong elapsed less hours I by 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.240
 if I have allowed this to dry for 10 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.690
 hours 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.599
 let's take the neck and let's 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.479
 shake the glitter we have to shake 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.099
 very well the excess as you can see 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.009
 lot of glitter because I had it 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.259
 buried under glitter and nothing 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.840
 it would stay like this once the 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.819
 glitter excess we are going to fix the one that 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.470
 has been stuck to the neck with lacquer 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.410
 lacquer the truth is that it goes very well 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.979
 to fix glitter on the neck or blue 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.020
 that you have seen in the intro of the video 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.050
 I have already put it on and it has not fallen off 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.569
 almost nothing of glitter having moved away 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.930
 the cause that I recommend this in a 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.130
 I thought about varnishing it but I thought 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.770
 after we talk about the garmin 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.720
 would raise the glitter and well then not 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.240
 I dared to do it like that so I threw him 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.650
 the lacquer and the truth is that it has been fixed 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.900
 fairly good 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.509
 the next step would be to cut two 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.220
 pieces of tie of the same size that is 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.160
 long enough to 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.110
 tie them around our neck 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.750
 once we have the two pieces of 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.760
 ties we take through the glue and 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.920
 we turn the neck and put a 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.320
 point of being administrative and other 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.900
 here and we paste on each side a piece of 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.330
 tie those would be the steps to make 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.490
 this bib collar as you see is 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.550
 you can do it to your 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.440
 taste and nothing if there is any doubt 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.720
 leaving a comment below and it 's 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.280
 happy pleased and nothing when always 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.260
 thank you very much for verne and not 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.260
 start the next video until later
