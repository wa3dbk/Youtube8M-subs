00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.440
 anne nor jorge will not teach a theater 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.440
 One day they think zig zag 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 Look how pretty she wants you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.340
 learn well with us 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 hello girls how can you understand me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 I was pregnant with the girl and I'm 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.740
 editing and putting voice to you now 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 good for making super braid hairstyles 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.609
 beautiful 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.320
 you need to separate a wick from the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.780
 front of your head like this. 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 separating this hair is important hair 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 be at ease to give it all 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.390
 right good looks the deal should stay 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.050
 very well, you use the cable of a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.989
 comb now you will separate in 4 mexes 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.670
 more or less of the same thickness 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.289
 hairstyle may seem a little difficult 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.280
 but it 's not just having a little bit of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.260
 patience 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.629
 now we have four strands in our hands 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.049
 You'll get the tip to go over 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 the next underneath the other and above 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.100
 of the other 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.070
 O father in the order there is two in the middle. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.890
 you pass over one another and go 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:28.009
 do the same thing here is there in 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.009
 tip you will go over underneath 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.930
 and now over 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.720
 Then you go over and so I tried 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.240
 show you the right one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.880
 half passes over one another always 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.820
 the middle you pass the right hand 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.619
 over the left hand and is doing 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 this looks goes over underneath by 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.119
 top 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 Then you get the two middle moves. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.439
 passes from the right hand over the hand 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.740
 left 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.630
 so once again let's see how it does not 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.470
 It's difficult after you pick up the pace. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.530
 you do it easily and it gets super 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.090
 It's beautiful, this hairstyle is one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 incredible visual and you're doing it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.430
 always the way I taught it above 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.920
 looks down and over 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.410
 Then you'll have two moves in the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.920
 half passes from the right hand over the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.880
 table of the left hand over 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.420
 down over two little marches in the middle 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.940
 You will pass from the right hand over 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.970
 of the left hand and will do the same 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.170
 thing until the end of your hair you 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.230
 can 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.380
 on one side only on both sides you can 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.410
 use this technique and make one 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.290
 a part of the hair make behind leaving 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.500
 on top of your hair so you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.319
 can use your creativity can do 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.319

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.769

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.260

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.299
 Occasions when it's over, you'll do it. 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.760
 that way I taught you to repeat 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.860
 several times until the end when it arrives 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.519
 in the end you have some middle moves 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.570
 and goes pulling thus pushing the hair 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.209
 the braid up and goes straight 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.459
