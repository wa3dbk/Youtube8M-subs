black<00:03:10.140> eye<00:03:10.380> shadow<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:10.980> step<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.490> would

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
black eye shadow in this step it would

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.820 
black eye shadow in this step it would
add<00:03:11.790> great<00:03:12.240> dimension<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.200> lot<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.470> depth

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
add great dimension and a lot of depth

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.100 
add great dimension and a lot of depth
to<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:14.550> I'm<00:03:15.540> also<00:03:15.720> gonna<00:03:15.900> take<00:03:16.050> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
little bit more of nocturnal and use

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.330
