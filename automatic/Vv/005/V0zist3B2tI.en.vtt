you<00:03:28.979> know<00:03:29.359> or<00:03:30.359> work<00:03:30.599> for<00:03:30.930> arms<00:03:31.349> for<00:03:31.560> grip<00:03:31.859> I

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
you know or work for arms for grip I

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:38.539 
you know or work for arms for grip I
believe<00:03:33.150> that's<00:03:35.359> that's<00:03:36.359> two<00:03:36.689> different<00:03:37.549> two

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
believe that's that's two different two

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.349 
believe that's that's two different two
different<00:03:38.879> things<00:03:39.030> two<00:03:39.269> different<00:03:39.389> strengths

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
different things two different strengths

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.569 
different things two different strengths
that's<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.479> grip<00:03:42.900> strength<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.579> grip

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
that's the grip strength is grip

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.839 
that's the grip strength is grip
strength<00:03:44.909> is<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:45.359> of<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:46.609> static<00:03:47.609> whole<00:03:47.849> and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
strength is more of a static whole and

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.629 
strength is more of a static whole and
the<00:03:50.849> squeezing<00:03:51.829> that's<00:03:52.829> too<00:03:53.040> different<00:03:53.430> you

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
the squeezing that's too different you

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.199 
the squeezing that's too different you
see<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.479> I'm<00:03:54.540> saying<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:56.370> also<00:03:56.549> forearm

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
see what I'm saying so and also forearm

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.210 
see what I'm saying so and also forearm
so<00:03:57.479> you<00:03:57.540> got<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.959> able<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.229> maintain<00:03:58.859> weight

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
so you got to be able to maintain weight

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.280 
so you got to be able to maintain weight
and<00:03:59.549> not<00:03:59.609> just<00:03:59.939> squeeze<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:00.989> got<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.259> be

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and not just squeeze it you got to be

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.349 
and not just squeeze it you got to be
able<00:04:01.439> to<00:04:01.590> hold<00:04:02.009> that<00:04:02.220> portion<00:04:02.909> okay<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:05.359> that's

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
able to hold that portion okay so that's
