00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.169
 all right 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.169
 i 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 ah 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.400
 hello good today I will say but what do you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400
 pass 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.770
 or it can be very easy it's also a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.449
 pasta with broccoli because I want to make it 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.430
 fast because I want that as we have 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 fast because we die of hunger so 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.750
 we go fast with the ingredients that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 are the following a package of pasta 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.830
 It can be of any type of letters 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.720
 that I have a pasta that says here of 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.519
 whole amaranth with vegetables on high 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.400
 but it can be any regular pasta 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.170
 that you want a dram dow a 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.320
 spoonful of brewer's yeast is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 embittered a quarter to chopped onion and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.360
 two cups two cups of broccoli washed and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.280
 raw then these are all the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280
 ingredients and let's sugar 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 then the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.360
 put water to boil with a sheet 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.240
 laurel and a piece of onion until 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.869
 now it is already boiling and along with the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.700
 pasta let's throw the broccoli let's 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.470
 let it be everything and right now it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.420
 finish cooking the pasta already is 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.060
 also at that point will be the broccoli and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.750
 we remove it and I tell them to basile him 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.260
 lack we return 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.980
 very well the pasta is already cooked and 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.330
 drained and the broccoli is barely 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.229
 cooked so you do not lose all your 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.229
 properties 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.540
 I always always prefer to cook more 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.520
 good thing in the steamed vegetables without 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.110
 But in this paste you should put 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 together with the pasta so that also everything 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.550
 the flavor of broccoli but it's very little 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 time I left it on fire about 34 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.640
 minutes depending also on the pasta 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.860
 obviously the fastest ones are questioned 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 fruits is because it is integrate is cooking 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.930
 faster is good and I put a little bit 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.440
 of oil in the pan and may suffer 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440
 the onions 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.120
 the onion 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.440
 transparent 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.440
 and half the equation 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.090
 garlic 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.460
 It is worth mentioning that this recipe 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.050
 october of dimension of ghana is a blog 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.970
 which is dedicated to natural recipes and 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.890
 they turn Italian then credits of 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.320
 them, but here he taught them and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.510
 It also remains in the channel and does not reach 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.880
 that then also have it we are going to 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.070
 approximate then is already changing a 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.550
 little bit of color and we're going to add the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.260
 chopped garlic 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.890
 they do not throw themselves together because they serve do not know 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.140
 what else 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.400
 then through the onion first 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.400
 and later 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.020
 to him and if he is like this half transparent and 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.320
 we are going to throw all the pasta with the forum 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.320
 set 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.510
 and more nothing and what we are going to put 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 let's start spicing up with the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.900
 other ingredients generated by the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.980
 unique and different flavor is the famous 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.489
 brewer's yeast then we're going to 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.489
 sprinkle 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.940
 and the examinee in which I am a recipe 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.830
 where that carries brewer's yeast is 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.810
 bitter then see that it is very 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.550
 versatile then buy yourself a medium in 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.840
 your kitchen because it's versatile is used to 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.940
 various things 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.110
 this is another recipe that takes you and is 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.460
 very well with a little salt I put the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:42.980
 grain 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:45.020
 They are and people are very crazy a little 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.560
 sea ​​salt 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.600
 and the original recipe brings before throwing 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.940
 the pasta and broccoli is a little 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.640
 of chili either from tree of something 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.980
 mainly so that it gets cold and you 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.680
 gives the flavor to the chili to the pasta but 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.290
 As I have children, I have not done it 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.350

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.490
 my dish in fact if the broken can 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.490

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.590
 akihito 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.510
 that's all we have to fry everything 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.390

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.250
