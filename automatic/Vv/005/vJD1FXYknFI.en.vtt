now this necklace is super super

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.520 
now this necklace is super super
lightweight<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.940> skull<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.600> just<00:04:37.290> feels

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
lightweight and the skull it just feels

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.070 
lightweight and the skull it just feels
so<00:04:37.830> delicate<00:04:38.370> she<00:04:38.910> did<00:04:39.090> seal<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.750> give<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.020> a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so delicate she did seal it to give it a

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.560 
so delicate she did seal it to give it a
little<00:04:40.230> more<00:04:40.500> strength<00:04:40.980> so<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:42.090> won't<00:04:42.330> be

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
little more strength so that it won't be

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.590 
little more strength so that it won't be
so<00:04:42.900> fragile<00:04:43.260> but<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.100> am<00:04:44.700> still<00:04:45.030> very<00:04:45.090> very

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
so fragile but I am still very very

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.050 
so fragile but I am still very very
careful<00:04:46.020> with<00:04:46.170> it<00:04:46.320> because<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:47.070> do<00:04:47.550> not<00:04:47.730> want<00:04:47.970> to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
careful with it because I do not want to

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.660 
careful with it because I do not want to
damage<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.480> in<00:04:48.600> any<00:04:48.750> way<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.920> this<00:04:50.250> necklace

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
damage it in any way so this necklace

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.020 
damage it in any way so this necklace
was<00:04:50.960> $48<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.350> shipping<00:04:52.770> was<00:04:52.920> $8.00

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
was $48 and the shipping was $8.00

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.460 
was $48 and the shipping was $8.00
I<00:04:54.060> think<00:04:54.600> these<00:04:54.690> necklaces<00:04:55.080> are<00:04:55.290> really

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
I think these necklaces are really

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.750 
I think these necklaces are really
special<00:04:55.740> because<00:04:56.130> they<00:04:56.250> are<00:04:56.370> one-of-a-kind

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
special because they are one-of-a-kind

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.980 
special because they are one-of-a-kind
