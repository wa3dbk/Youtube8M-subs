00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.880 
intelligent I want to make a new nature
so<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:39.989> don't<00:02:40.830> want<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.459> an<00:02:41.610> imitation<00:02:42.030> of

so I don't want to make an imitation of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.090 
so I don't want to make an imitation of

De<00:03:06.540> Anza<00:03:06.870> has<00:03:07.200> built<00:03:07.410> several<00:03:07.709> generations<00:03:08.489> of

De Anza has built several generations of

De Anza has built several generations of
beasts<00:03:09.150> in<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.390> last<00:03:09.600> 24<00:03:10.170> years<00:03:10.340> his<00:03:11.340> goal<00:03:11.700> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
beasts in the last 24 years his goal is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.959 
beasts in the last 24 years his goal is
to<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.239> them<00:03:12.450> live<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.930> without<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.690 

and<00:03:17.969> this<00:03:18.359> evolutionary<00:03:19.290> tale<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:20.010> far<00:03:20.430> from

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
and this evolutionary tale is far from

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.420 
and this evolutionary tale is far from
over<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:23.370> fast<00:03:23.790> isn't<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.389> for<00:03:24.689> evolution

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
over this fast isn't it for evolution

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.190 
over this fast isn't it for evolution
but<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.939> be<00:03:27.060> fast<00:03:27.329> because<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:27.840> don't

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
but I have to be fast because I don't

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.500 
but I have to be fast because I don't
have<00:03:28.349> millions<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.980> years<00:03:29.280> maybe<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:30.389> have

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
have millions of years maybe you have

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.039 
have millions of years maybe you have
just<00:03:30.719> twenty<00:03:31.109> years<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.519> they<00:03:33.329> need<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.900> be

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
just twenty years and so they need to be

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.240 
just twenty years and so they need to be
go<00:03:34.819> another<00:03:35.840> forty<00:03:36.840> generations<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
go another forty generations in the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.830 
go another forty generations in the
future<00:03:40.549> Taeyeon's<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.790> strand<00:03:42.180> beasts<00:03:42.659> are

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
future Taeyeon's and strand beasts are

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.649 
future Taeyeon's and strand beasts are
found<00:03:43.139> all<00:03:43.469> over<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.829> world<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.760> beaches<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
found all over the world on beaches and

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.789 
found all over the world on beaches and
in<00:03:46.109> exhibitions<00:03:48.019> Johnson<00:03:49.019> hopes<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.379> other

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
in exhibitions Johnson hopes that other

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.979 
in exhibitions Johnson hopes that other
people<00:03:50.219> will<00:03:50.430> continue<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:51.060> refine<00:03:51.510> his

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
people will continue to refine his

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.580 
people will continue to refine his
constructions<00:03:53.329> they<00:03:54.329> will<00:03:54.510> survive<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
constructions they will survive and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.369 
constructions they will survive and
hopefully<00:03:56.069> inspire<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:57.209> lot<00:03:57.540> younger<00:03:57.810> people

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
hopefully inspire a lot younger people

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.929 
hopefully inspire a lot younger people
to<00:03:59.069> go<00:03:59.219> on<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.609> this<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:01.280> so<00:04:02.280> as<00:04:02.579> soon<00:04:02.790> as

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
to go on with this and so as soon as

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.569 
to go on with this and so as soon as
they<00:04:03.180> has<00:04:03.599> spread<00:04:03.959> out<00:04:04.139> my<00:04:04.349> ashes<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
they has spread out my ashes of the

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.170 
they has spread out my ashes of the
beach<00:04:05.810> then<00:04:06.810> maybe<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.040> new<00:04:08.219> generations<00:04:08.939> are

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
beach then maybe the new generations are

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.129 
beach then maybe the new generations are
going<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.169> with<00:04:10.409> this<00:04:11.389> an<00:04:12.389> exhibition<00:04:13.019> of

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
going on with this an exhibition of

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.470 
going on with this an exhibition of
taeyeon<00:04:13.680> sand<00:04:13.949> strand<00:04:14.340> beasts<00:04:14.819> opens<00:04:15.329> in
