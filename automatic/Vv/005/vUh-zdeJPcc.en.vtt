 automotive history 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.789
 throughout the day to be 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 with you and we start with one of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.850
 show nails complete the surf because 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.230
 we are sure of ashes we it is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.140
 does he pass on the stand renault and well 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.909
 he goes there the renault is 50 years old 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 of the 8 gordini that appeared at the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 Paris Salon 1964 with this version 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.020
 so who was the first one so we 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630
 see here on this stand that stands out 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 by rims a little bit more 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.080
 narrow a little difference before 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 to appear after in version 13 are 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.549
 like me a little bit further here and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.659
 this is a rally version because 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.939
 this car was totally 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 versatile could do both 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.369
 circuit racing and rallying well 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 sure and his particular cars did the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.570
 last in monte carlo history with 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 jean ragnotti with other pilots who 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 of course it was 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.350
 through the gordini cut which is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.400
 born in 1966 with the very meaning version there 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.180
 we'll see a little bit later 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.880
 it is 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.560
 it's the gordini cut revealed all 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.520
 a young generation of French pilots 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.220
 who finally had access to the competition 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.780
 a price say modest for the time and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.090
 especially revealed people like jeans 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.300
 stone jarier alain cullier michel 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.640
 leclerc guy frequelin 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.430
 jean ragnotti we already mentioned everything to 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.720
 time and here it is in version 13 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.160
 years which is the most accomplished version 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.660
 the most powerful because she was doing 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.870
 almost 110 horses anyway to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.830
 the time is quite light it was 900 kg 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.750
 basically and it was a race car 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.250
 sold in the renault network had been 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.630
 not a small sport sports car 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.070
 who was giving a race car was 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.750
 really a race car at 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.160
 I was starting to put some 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.660
 safety equipment that we could 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.370
 line up in circuit racing where we 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.810
 immediately rally cars access 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.010
 already it's you even what you have 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.450
 I was a little yellow anyway 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 the time but I had the opportunity to 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.140
 drive a little not in the 80s 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.360
 it was pretty drives it's very 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.050
 alive let's say it's very much alive it takes 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.400
 to be very very very very humble let's say 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.810
 everyone is not called I'll have 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.370
 tools to be able to control 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.020
 great slip of the rear gear is 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.190
 what can we find that today in 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.140
 opportunity is what you can drive with 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.760
 that every day your dear ones maybe a 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.800
 little it's worth his voice a bit expensive because 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.880
 than on the twelve thousand copies 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.260
 products, there is only one 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.850
 many have suffered the name of all 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.980
 it is precisely these young pilots in 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.620
 grass that is a lot have ended in 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.510
 so would the number have decreased a lot 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.490
 and in addition a kind of love rib 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.980
 for the r8 gordini which is fine 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.450
 normal one way remains very expensive at 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.580
 heart of all passionate so the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.020
 side tends to go up and for a very 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.320
 beautiful model we want we can put 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.970
 almost at 30000 okay here we can 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.380
 to ride at almost ten years a 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030
 car that had his certificate of 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.130
 mines obviously with the extensions 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.450
 a little short on vecta mansle at the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.830
 maréchaussée would see maybe that of a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.420
 bad eye but in strictly 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.150
 standard can be rolled on a daily basis 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.300
 very well perfect thank you continues the
