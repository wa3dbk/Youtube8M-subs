hand<00:01:23.010> guards<00:01:23.370> Co<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:26.120> side<00:01:27.120> mirrors<00:01:27.480> because<00:01:27.690> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
hand guards Co so side mirrors because I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710 
hand guards Co so side mirrors because I
believe<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.130> worst<00:01:29.340> aspect<00:01:29.910> of<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.120> bike

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
believe the worst aspect of this bike

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.400 
believe the worst aspect of this bike
other<00:01:31.650> than<00:01:31.800> being<00:01:31.860> carbureted<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
other than being carbureted is it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.350 
other than being carbureted is it's
horrible<00:01:34.410> horrendous<00:01:34.650> mirrors<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.300> I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
horrible horrendous mirrors and so I

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.280 
horrible horrendous mirrors and so I
added<00:01:37.130> pretty<00:01:38.130> ineffective<00:01:38.550> mirrors<00:01:39.290> but

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
added pretty ineffective mirrors but

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.880 
added pretty ineffective mirrors but
they<00:01:40.650> look<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.370> not<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:43.020> honestly<00:01:43.770> they

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
they look cool and not out honestly they

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
they look cool and not out honestly they
actually<00:01:44.220> operate<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.240> lot<00:01:45.450> better<00:01:45.660> than

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually operate a lot better than

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.430 
actually operate a lot better than
little<00:01:46.400> oval<00:01:47.400> shape<00:01:47.670> mirrors<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.300> I<00:01:48.810> just

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440
