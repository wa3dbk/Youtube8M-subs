be<00:01:39.720> torqued<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> 60<00:01:41.630> when<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.810> done<00:01:44.659> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
be torqued to 60 when it's done so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
be torqued to 60 when it's done so
that's<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.579> easy<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.049> these<00:01:49.409> two

babies this is the main air bag one the
heated<00:01:54.090> option<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.899> another

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
heated option will have another

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
heated option will have another
connector<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> did<00:01:56.759> install<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:57.479> car

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
connector which I did install in my car

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.370 
connector which I did install in my car
see<00:01:57.990> he<00:01:58.229> used<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> heated<00:01:59.759> single<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
see he used to have a heated single with

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
see he used to have a heated single with
a<00:02:01.409> slip<00:02:01.770> ring<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.340> slip<00:02:02.640> ring<00:02:02.820> has<00:02:03.000> four

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a slip ring now that slip ring has four

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.580 
a slip ring now that slip ring has four
connectors<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.570> slipping<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.320> my

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
connectors this is my slipping out of my

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.619 
connectors this is my slipping out of my
car<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.879> didn't<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> heated

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
car because I didn't have a heated

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.720 
car because I didn't have a heated
option<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:11.009> victor<00:02:11.310> seeing<00:02:11.610> will

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
option and the victor seeing will

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.670 
option and the victor seeing will
doesn't<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> heel

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
doesn't have a heel

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.890 
doesn't have a heel
the<00:02:12.920> reason<00:02:13.280> being<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.730> he<00:02:14.450> would<00:02:14.599> have<00:02:14.629> seen

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
the reason being is he would have seen

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.170 
the reason being is he would have seen
the<00:02:15.049> wires<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.769> through<00:02:15.980> here<00:02:16.400> and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
the wires going through here and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.339 
the wires going through here and
apparently<00:02:17.659> they<00:02:17.840> go<00:02:17.989> through<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.319> whole

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
apparently they go through the whole

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.640 
apparently they go through the whole
core<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:20.299> doesn't<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.989> he<00:02:21.319> did<00:02:21.470> not

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
core but this one doesn't so he did not

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.039 
core but this one doesn't so he did not
need<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.950> sleep<00:02:22.310> ring<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:23.390> four<00:02:23.659> connectors

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
need a sleep ring the four connectors

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.710 
need a sleep ring the four connectors

good<00:04:04.319> as<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> teeth<00:04:04.770> look<00:04:07.850> it<00:04:08.850> actually<00:04:09.030> did

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
good as the teeth look it actually did

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.750 
good as the teeth look it actually did
go<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:10.500> it's<00:04:10.650> off<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:13.370> mean<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.580> notches

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
go in but it's off I mean the notches
