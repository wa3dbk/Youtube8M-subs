00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.110
 good that such a standard of living 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.780
 artistic dotcom be you 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.030
 welcome again that wave of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.490
 music guitar and I invite you to follow 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.829
 in this course with much enthusiasm a lot 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.620
 delivery and dedication 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.140
 we had already seen the circle of fifths 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.000
 we both saw it separately flats 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.549
 sustained and then the union now 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.610
 let's see the application of that circle 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.290
 of fifths for the scale of F major 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 remember that the armor of the scale 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.759
 of F major had a B flat then 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.759
 the scale of fa is going to be funk 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.979
 but on the way we make the notes 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.940
 natural - of the cycle as in the scale 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:29.610
 in three octaves to my left position 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 of a storage room with two other frets 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 eduardo oils fret four we make 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.210
 more this rope first fret sun is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.990
 agrees third fret 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.170
 to the air if flat fifth string first 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.170
 fret 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.350
 that you remember the fret that keeps the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.229
 air my fourth when they are still behind 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.229
 the fourth string third fret we do 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 second 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.710
 the fourth string third fret 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 third sun to air the third the 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.290
 second fret if flat third in 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.000
 third fret here we are going to do the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.840
 technique that we have always used since the 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.930
 slip or portamento that is let 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.000
 we did go to the dow we do this and 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.260
 we look for the dow with the finger one in 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.260
 third fifth fret string 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 the third seventh fret agreement what 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.470
 we make smooth and looking for the real 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.990
 now to me 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.550
 second fifth string after second ifa 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.550
 sixth string after we make 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.780
 third eighth phase with a sixth string 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 fret only second string eighth after 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:12.450
 the first fifth string fret b flat 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.970
 on first string sixth fret two on 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.260
 first agreement to all fret slipped 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.920
 to look for the rest of the crime in 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.410
 fourth video to the fret 13 but 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.460
 toco is the first rope network 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.460
 we say thank you 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.459
 after my first string or another 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.680
 and then the first string funk 13 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.510
 others with the imitation in the first 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.519
 part use these four fingers from 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.750
 the first fret in the second part 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.450
 use these four fingers from the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.390
 fifth trust 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.519
 of 21 other three fingers these fret 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.330
 another is seventh after this fourth video 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.200
 is other 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.200
 I made this invitation 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:02.390
 and now I moved to the invitation of 21 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.760
 in tenth fret of 22 in a sentence 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.010
 other frets then to other tissue 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.510
 fourth between a fret is this 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.010
 delegation 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.860
 and so much 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.920
 of the video ribbon until you reach the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.050
 finger 1 to break 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.050
 and I'm going to do the whole scale 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.700
 I turn in the same way 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.300
 fa 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:44.330
 Fourth finger precious first fret 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.510
 rope me in 12 to another his first 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.510
 rope 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.990
 in the contrast 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.580
 and slid down and that to me from one 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.780
 the fifth one back but with the fourth I'm going to 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.800
 do the two 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.490
 Simon on the sixth fret the fifth 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.130
 and I return by the way that comes 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.130
 they are for me 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.510
 now ready to look for the see the 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.770
 moon 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.770
 but with finger 3 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.080
 be the technique of sliding towards 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.410
 down the same will serve as a space to 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.410
 techniques 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.409
 It's the water 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.180
 ready friends that's the scale let's do 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.000
 always fingering average index or index 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.069
 annular or half annular or if the 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.629
 combinations that you want now 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.919
 let's see a bit the application is 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:17.069
 scale can serve us this scale is 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.930
 the first scale the first degree the 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.819
 monÃ³nico can serve us to improvise 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.069
 in the key of fa greater naturalness 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.139
 fame me the important grades the fourth 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.949
 and the fifth are important degrees for 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.770
 greater step the B flat greater degree 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.289
 important and fifth grade two fa sun has 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.150
 been and we use the fifth grade with 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:41.990
 seventh minus 27 is let's say a topic that 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.990
 let's have more or less like that 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.370
 we can even with the scale of 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.370
 problem 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.789
 dt 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.430
 dv 

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:27.059
 it's also a relative if we can use 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:29.719
 that scale to improvise what there is 

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:29.719
 is that practice 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.020
 smart friends that's to generate ideas 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.000
 melodic then let's see how 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.950
 generate a little more leads ideas 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.300
 melodic in our later class and 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:01.980
 good but this class has been his 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.980
 very nice liking are very well
