think they're a bit tense out there than

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.750 
think they're a bit tense out there than
this<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.049> for<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.709> price<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.340> think<00:02:54.610> this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
this one for the price I think this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.120 
this one for the price I think this
one's<00:02:55.000> around<00:02:55.209> 75<00:02:55.930> dollars<00:02:56.349> or<00:02:56.530> something<00:02:56.739> and

really<00:05:33.490> like<00:05:33.729> this<00:05:33.909> tan<00:05:34.180> there<00:05:34.539> are<00:05:34.719> a<00:05:34.750> few

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
really like this tan there are a few

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.670 
really like this tan there are a few
cons<00:05:35.259> though<00:05:35.560> again<00:05:36.270> basically<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:38.139> price<00:05:38.409> of

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
cons though again basically the price of

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.110 
cons though again basically the price of
it<00:05:38.830> is<00:05:38.979> just<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.520> damn<00:05:40.210> expensive<00:05:40.839> like<00:05:42.120> why

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
it is just so damn expensive like why

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.879 
it is just so damn expensive like why
why<00:05:43.900> did<00:05:44.500> that<00:05:44.620> have<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.770> be<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.069> expensive<00:05:45.310> and

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
why did that have to be so expensive and

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.800 
why did that have to be so expensive and
like<00:05:47.889> I've<00:05:48.129> used<00:05:48.520> these<00:05:48.639> paid<00:05:48.879> four<00:05:49.479> or<00:05:49.599> five

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
like I've used these paid four or five

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.399 
like I've used these paid four or five
times<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:51.060> have<00:05:52.060> you<00:05:52.210> so<00:05:52.569> much<00:05:52.810> product<00:05:53.110> I

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
times I have you so much product I

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.249 
times I have you so much product I
probably<00:05:53.710> have<00:05:54.039> about<00:05:54.189> one<00:05:54.909> to<00:05:55.569> two<00:05:55.629> turns

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
probably have about one to two turns

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.969 
probably have about one to two turns
left<00:05:56.439> in<00:05:56.740> this<00:05:56.889> and<00:05:57.960> to<00:05:58.960> me<00:05:59.139> that<00:05:59.439> I<00:05:59.469> find<00:05:59.800> that

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
left in this and to me that I find that

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.089 
left in this and to me that I find that
was<00:06:00.159> really<00:06:00.460> disappointing<00:06:01.060> because<00:06:02.099> the

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
was really disappointing because the

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.730 
was really disappointing because the
color<00:06:03.339> is<00:06:03.490> not<00:06:03.610> crazy<00:06:04.029> crazy<00:06:04.419> dark<00:06:04.779> and<00:06:05.169> they

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
color is not crazy crazy dark and they

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.589 
color is not crazy crazy dark and they
call<00:06:05.949> it<00:06:06.099> the<00:06:06.219> intense<00:06:06.580> color<00:06:06.879> so<00:06:07.210> if<00:06:07.569> you

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
call it the intense color so if you

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.329 
call it the intense color so if you
wanted<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.139> really<00:06:08.319> dark<00:06:08.529> turn<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:08.919> have<00:06:09.069> to<00:06:09.219> do

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339 
wanted a really dark turn you have to do

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.640 
wanted a really dark turn you have to do
two<00:06:09.520> layers<00:06:09.699> and<00:06:10.060> honestly<00:06:10.659> you<00:06:11.289> just<00:06:11.319> don't

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
two layers and honestly you just don't

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.200 
two layers and honestly you just don't
get<00:06:11.740> enough<00:06:11.919> product<00:06:12.279> in<00:06:12.400> this<00:06:12.520> I<00:06:12.699> don't<00:06:12.939> think

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
get enough product in this I don't think

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.329 
get enough product in this I don't think
they<00:06:13.360> even<00:06:13.629> come<00:06:13.839> in<00:06:13.990> bigger<00:06:14.379> sizes<00:06:14.680> yeah

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:15.339 
they even come in bigger sizes yeah

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.839 
they even come in bigger sizes yeah
these<00:06:15.729> little<00:06:16.240> bottles<00:06:16.479> are<00:06:16.810> so<00:06:17.139> expensive<00:06:17.849> so

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
these little bottles are so expensive so

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.409 
these little bottles are so expensive so
I<00:06:19.560> really<00:06:20.560> really<00:06:21.039> really<00:06:21.430> wish<00:06:22.029> that<00:06:22.270> they

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
I really really really wish that they

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.240 
I really really really wish that they
had<00:06:22.599> came<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:23.020> bigger<00:06:23.199> bottles<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:23.800> maybe

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
had came in bigger bottles and maybe

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.519 
had came in bigger bottles and maybe
that<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:24.520> was<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.639> little<00:06:25.000> bit<00:06:25.180> darker<00:06:25.529> because

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:26.529 
that it was a little bit darker because

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.920 
that it was a little bit darker because
that<00:06:26.889> way<00:06:27.120> you<00:06:28.120> wouldn't<00:06:28.270> have<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:28.599> apply<00:06:28.870> two

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
that way you wouldn't have to apply two

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.189 
that way you wouldn't have to apply two
coats<00:06:29.139> so<00:06:29.819> that's<00:06:30.819> really<00:06:31.029> my<00:06:31.240> only<00:06:31.479> con<00:06:31.990> with

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
coats so that's really my only con with

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.629 
coats so that's really my only con with
it<00:06:32.319> I<00:06:32.409> just<00:06:32.469> don't<00:06:32.800> really<00:06:33.430> like<00:06:33.729> the<00:06:34.120> price

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639
