00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.659 
is really nice and if she gets really
loud<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.880> 10<00:04:17.209> DB<00:04:17.720> pad<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.859> kind<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.400> a<00:04:19.459> nice

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
loud that 10 DB pad is kind of a nice

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.730 
loud that 10 DB pad is kind of a nice
feature<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.890> now<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.130> move<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.760> MTR<00:04:23.740> 231

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
feature and now we move to the MTR 231

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.860 
feature and now we move to the MTR 231
this<00:04:25.669> microphone

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
this microphone

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.830 
this microphone
has<00:04:26.960> some<00:04:27.260> features<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.600> some<00:04:29.600> other

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
has some features that some other

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.560 
has some features that some other
microphones<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.770> that<00:04:31.250> price<00:04:31.639> category<00:04:32.240> just

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
microphones in that price category just

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.810 
microphones in that price category just
don't<00:04:32.780> have<00:04:33.020> you'll<00:04:33.560> notice<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:33.979> does<00:04:34.190> come<00:04:34.490> as

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
don't have you'll notice it does come as

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.240 
don't have you'll notice it does come as
a<00:04:34.880> really<00:04:35.600> nice<00:04:35.720> carrying<00:04:36.139> case<00:04:36.199> don't<00:04:37.190> forget

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
shock mount and pop filter but this

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.159 
shock mount and pop filter but this
microphone<00:04:43.070> very<00:04:44.060> well<00:04:44.300> built<00:04:44.570> it's<00:04:44.990> heavy

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
microphone very well built it's heavy

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.000 
microphone very well built it's heavy
it's<00:04:45.680> nice<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:46.550> does<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.960> 10<00:04:48.320> DB<00:04:48.740> pad

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
it's nice it does have the 10 DB pad

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.550 
it's nice it does have the 10 DB pad
which<00:04:49.310> will<00:04:49.760> come<00:04:49.940> in<00:04:50.060> handy<00:04:50.210> but<00:04:51.199> look<00:04:51.380> over

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
which will come in handy but look over

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.980 
which will come in handy but look over
here<00:04:51.830> what<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.729> can<00:04:52.940> do<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.270> this<00:04:53.449> microphone

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
here what it can do what this microphone

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.200 
here what it can do what this microphone
can<00:04:54.199> do<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.560> it<00:04:54.949> can<00:04:54.979> be<00:04:55.130> used<00:04:55.250> in<00:04:55.760> three

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
can do is it can be used in three

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.780 
can do is it can be used in three
different<00:04:57.020> patterns<00:04:57.440> what<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.340> means<00:04:58.580> is

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
different patterns what that means is

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.580 
different patterns what that means is
the<00:04:59.419> other<00:04:59.600> microphones<00:05:00.139> and<00:05:00.410> most

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
the other microphones and most

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.320 
the other microphones and most
microphones<00:05:01.160> are<00:05:01.370> a<00:05:01.400> heart-shaped<00:05:01.669> pattern

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
microphones are a heart-shaped pattern

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.969 
microphones are a heart-shaped pattern
so<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.020> it<00:05:03.650> picks<00:05:04.010> up<00:05:04.310> right<00:05:05.270> in<00:05:05.539> this<00:05:05.780> area

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
so that it picks up right in this area

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.120 
so that it picks up right in this area
heart-shaped

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
heart-shaped

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.920 
heart-shaped
this<00:05:07.699> one<00:05:07.910> you<00:05:08.000> can<00:05:08.120> move<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.419> figure<00:05:08.750> eight

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
this one you can move to a figure eight

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.680 
this one you can move to a figure eight
which<00:05:09.500> means<00:05:09.530> that<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:11.090> can<00:05:11.240> put<00:05:11.389> it<00:05:11.479> maybe

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
which means that you can put it maybe

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.740 
which means that you can put it maybe
between<00:05:11.930> two<00:05:12.260> guitarists<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.389> have<00:05:14.389> one<00:05:14.630> on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
between two guitarists and have one on

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.110 
between two guitarists and have one on
this<00:05:14.900> side<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.169> one<00:05:15.530> on<00:05:15.560> that<00:05:15.800> side<00:05:16.120> we've

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
this side and one on that side we've

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.240 
this side and one on that side we've
used<00:05:17.330> these<00:05:17.630> style<00:05:18.470> of<00:05:18.650> microphones<00:05:19.070> in<00:05:19.220> a

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
used these style of microphones in a

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.830 
used these style of microphones in a
wide<00:05:19.460> pattern<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:20.240> pick<00:05:20.389> up<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.600> conversation

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
wide pattern to pick up a conversation

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.930 
wide pattern to pick up a conversation
between<00:05:21.650> two<00:05:21.949> people<00:05:22.720> works<00:05:23.720> very<00:05:24.110> very<00:05:24.199> well

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
between two people works very very well

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.210 
between two people works very very well
and<00:05:25.940> then<00:05:26.620> there's<00:05:27.620> another<00:05:27.770> attachment

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
and then there's another attachment

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.600 
and then there's another attachment
that's<00:05:28.580> Omni<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.630> with<00:05:30.560> an<00:05:30.650> omni<00:05:31.099> direction

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
that's Omni and with an omni direction

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.070 
that's Omni and with an omni direction
basically<00:05:31.940> put<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.479> in<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.690> center<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:32.990> the

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
basically put this in the center of the

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.719 
basically put this in the center of the
room<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.320> will<00:05:33.410> pick<00:05:33.560> up<00:05:33.680> everything<00:05:34.520> all

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
room it will pick up everything all

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.420 
room it will pick up everything all
around<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.510> so<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.349> is<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.590> very<00:05:37.010> very<00:05:37.250> good

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
around it so this is a very very good

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.060 
around it so this is a very very good
microphone<00:05:37.820> again<00:05:38.510> bottom<00:05:39.260> end<00:05:39.440> is<00:05:39.620> not<00:05:39.889> as

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
microphone again bottom end is not as

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.339 
microphone again bottom end is not as
rich<00:05:40.370> as<00:05:40.760> some<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.360> others<00:05:41.630> but<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.200> high

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
rich as some of the others but the high

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.469 
rich as some of the others but the high
frequency<00:05:42.860> response<00:05:42.979> is<00:05:43.490> very<00:05:43.580> very<00:05:44.090> good<00:05:44.330> if

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
frequency response is very very good if

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.420 
frequency response is very very good if
anything<00:05:44.990> it's<00:05:45.110> a<00:05:45.200> little<00:05:45.410> bright<00:05:45.650> on<00:05:45.860> all<00:05:46.160> of

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
anything it's a little bright on all of

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.469 
anything it's a little bright on all of
these<00:05:46.520> MTR<00:05:47.120> microphones<00:05:47.680> for<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.830> price<00:05:49.479> you

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
these MTR microphones for the price you

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.629 
these MTR microphones for the price you
can't<00:05:50.750> go<00:05:50.900> wrong<00:05:51.080> it's<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.440> great<00:05:51.740> way<00:05:51.979> to<00:05:52.250> start

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
can't go wrong it's a great way to start

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.390 
can't go wrong it's a great way to start
building<00:05:53.120> your<00:05:53.419> mic<00:05:53.720> kit<00:05:54.070> so<00:05:55.070> there<00:05:55.250> you<00:05:55.340> have

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
building your mic kit so there you have

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.839 
building your mic kit so there you have
it

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
it

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.330 
it
spec<00:05:56.270> sheet<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.750> we<00:05:57.380> use<00:05:57.560> these<00:05:57.800> microphones

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
spec sheet and we use these microphones

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.800 
spec sheet and we use these microphones
in<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.520> studio<00:05:58.880> in<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.090> number<00:05:59.389> of<00:05:59.419> different

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
in the studio in a number of different

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.480 
in the studio in a number of different
applications<00:06:00.440> and<00:06:00.620> I'll<00:06:01.039> tell<00:06:01.190> you<00:06:01.250> the<00:06:01.340> ones

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
applications and I'll tell you the ones

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.490 
applications and I'll tell you the ones
to<00:06:01.699> really<00:06:01.910> really<00:06:02.270> focus<00:06:02.360> on<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:03.289> low

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
to really really focus on the low

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.189 
to really really focus on the low
frequencies<00:06:04.130> not<00:06:04.699> as<00:06:04.940> rich<00:06:05.360> as<00:06:05.720> some<00:06:06.020> of<00:06:06.110> the

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
frequencies not as rich as some of the

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.560 
frequencies not as rich as some of the
much<00:06:06.800> more<00:06:06.979> expensive<00:06:07.280> microphones<00:06:07.970> but<00:06:08.449> the

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
much more expensive microphones but the

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.870 
much more expensive microphones but the
high<00:06:08.720> ends<00:06:09.110> pretty<00:06:09.680> good<00:06:09.949> frequency<00:06:10.460> response

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
high ends pretty good frequency response

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.129
