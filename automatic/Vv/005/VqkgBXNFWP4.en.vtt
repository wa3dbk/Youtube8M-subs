had to know why she left and I felt that

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.460 
had to know why she left and I felt that
the<00:01:22.130> key<00:01:22.369> to<00:01:22.550> understanding<00:01:23.110> rested<00:01:24.110> with<00:01:24.259> you

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
but now I'm even more confused I can't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.240 
but now I'm even more confused I can't
say<00:01:29.929> whether<00:01:30.140> her<00:01:30.350> choice<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:30.860> fact<00:01:31.069> was

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
say whether her choice in fact was

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.990 
say whether her choice in fact was
foolish<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:31.940> not<00:01:32.679> all<00:01:33.819> residents<00:01:34.819> of<00:01:34.880> the

velvet room are destined to find
themselves<00:01:37.190> it<00:01:38.149> was<00:01:38.360> true<00:01:38.660> for<00:01:38.840> her<00:01:38.990> as<00:01:39.140> well

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
themselves it was true for her as well

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.740 
themselves it was true for her as well
why<00:01:40.340> did<00:01:40.520> she<00:01:40.550> suddenly<00:01:40.880> give<00:01:41.300> up<00:01:41.450> on<00:01:41.600> her

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
why did she suddenly give up on her

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.370 
why did she suddenly give up on her
quest<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:43.220> was<00:01:43.490> my<00:01:43.640> greatest<00:01:43.940> worry<00:01:44.380> but

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
quest that was my greatest worry but

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.150 
quest that was my greatest worry but
then<00:01:45.530> again<00:01:45.679> maybe<00:01:46.640> my<00:01:47.000> premises<00:01:47.509> were<00:01:47.720> flawed

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
then again maybe my premises were flawed

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.609 
then again maybe my premises were flawed
maybe<00:01:49.160> she<00:01:49.429> found<00:01:49.670> her<00:01:49.940> answer<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.569> so<00:01:51.319> left

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
maybe she found her answer and so left

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.699 
maybe she found her answer and so left
this<00:01:51.830> place<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.550> which<00:01:53.450> case<00:01:53.750> my<00:01:54.170> role<00:01:54.440> is<00:01:54.679> not
