00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's only been my my third bottle is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
it's only been my my third bottle is
because<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.340> taking<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> day<00:01:54.210> instead

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
because I was taking one a day instead

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
because I was taking one a day instead
of<00:01:54.570> two<00:01:54.689> times<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.229> day<00:01:55.259> which<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.250> helped

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
and only because

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.880 
and only because
I<00:02:10.869> started<00:02:11.319> taking<00:02:11.560> exhale<00:02:12.989> which<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.230> from

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
I started taking exhale which is from

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.190 
I started taking exhale which is from
the<00:02:15.010> founders<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.459> proactive<00:02:15.670> but<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.959> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
the founders of proactive but it's I I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.780 
the founders of proactive but it's I I
believe<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> version<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.280> team<00:02:18.519> so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
believe this the version for the team so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.820 
believe this the version for the team so
it's<00:02:18.970> like<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:19.360> three<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.780> one<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:20.620> that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it's like all three and one so then that

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.990 
it's like all three and one so then that
you<00:02:21.010> don't<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.370> go<00:02:21.489> through<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.849> whole

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
you don't have to go through the whole

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.880 
you don't have to go through the whole
process<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.750> getting<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.349> know<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.590> cotton

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
scrubber on my face some people said
that<00:03:12.700> they<00:03:13.000> thought<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.329> was<00:03:13.420> too<00:03:13.629> harsh<00:03:13.989> to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
that they thought it was too harsh to

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.590 
that they thought it was too harsh to
use<00:03:15.280> on<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> face<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.910> use<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.180> for<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.420> body

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
use on the face they use it for the body

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.629 
use on the face they use it for the body
but<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.930> me<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.319> was<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:17.889> exfoliating

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
but to me it was like just exfoliating

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.930 
but to me it was like just exfoliating
your<00:03:18.670> face<00:03:19.060> like<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:20.079> like<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:21.400> gravel

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
your face like it just like the gravel

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.539 
your face like it just like the gravel
or<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.299> guess<00:03:22.569> like<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.190> texture<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.370> was<00:03:24.519> a

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
or I guess like the texture it was a

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.460 
or I guess like the texture it was a
little<00:03:24.940> bit<00:03:25.060> too<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.600> guess

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
little bit too I guess

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.720 
little bit too I guess
they<00:03:26.739> thought<00:03:26.889> it<00:03:27.010> was<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.130> little<00:03:27.220> too<00:03:27.459> hard

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
they thought it was a little too hard

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.030 
they thought it was a little too hard
for<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.090> skin<00:03:28.510> or<00:03:29.139> at<00:03:29.410> least<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.680> go<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:29.889> their

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
for the skin or at least to go on their

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.400 
for the skin or at least to go on their
face<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.549> actually<00:03:31.209> my<00:03:31.510> face<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.930> cleared<00:03:32.230> up

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
face but actually my face it cleared up

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.319 
face but actually my face it cleared up
with<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.739> as<00:03:32.889> well<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.910> was<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.209> like

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
with that as well and it was just like

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.780 
with that as well and it was just like
as<00:03:35.139> if<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.530> were<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:36.160> exfoliate<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.760> skin

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
as if you were to exfoliate the skin

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.270
