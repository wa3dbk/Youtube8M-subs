00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
blender because I feel like it applies

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.310 
blender because I feel like it applies
it<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.650> little<00:01:21.830> bit<00:01:21.920> more<00:01:22.130> evenly<00:01:22.520> than<00:01:22.850> using

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
it a little bit more evenly than using

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.050 
it a little bit more evenly than using
another<00:01:24.320> kind<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.650> sponge<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.310> just<00:01:25.610> dab<00:01:25.910> it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
another kind of sponge so I just dab it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.930 
another kind of sponge so I just dab it
around<00:01:26.980> until<00:01:27.980> I<00:01:28.010> feel<00:01:28.370> like<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.760> even

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
around until I feel like it's even

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.480 
around until I feel like it's even
enough<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.840> set<00:01:33.170> all<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.740> with<00:01:34.280> a

Nikko scelera
I<00:06:54.150> ordered<00:06:54.780> them<00:06:54.870> online<00:06:55.020> they<00:06:55.590> are<00:06:55.860> I<00:06:56.190> think

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
I ordered them online they are I think

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.580 
I ordered them online they are I think
they're<00:06:56.490> called<00:06:56.639> the<00:06:56.699> nebula<00:06:57.120> ones<00:06:57.330> they're

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
they're called the nebula ones they're

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.939 
they're called the nebula ones they're
they're<00:06:58.590> 17<00:06:59.100> millimeter<00:06:59.580> mini<00:06:59.850> scleras<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.860> I

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949 
they're 17 millimeter mini scleras and I

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.730 
they're 17 millimeter mini scleras and I
think<00:07:02.130> that<00:07:02.280> they<00:07:02.400> really<00:07:02.430> add<00:07:03.320> impact<00:07:04.320> to<00:07:04.620> the

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
think that they really add impact to the

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.560 
think that they really add impact to the
look<00:07:05.240> lenses<00:07:06.240> always<00:07:06.690> at<00:07:07.050> impact<00:07:07.530> I<00:07:07.680> find<00:07:08.570> but

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:09.570 
look lenses always at impact I find but

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.890 
look lenses always at impact I find but
