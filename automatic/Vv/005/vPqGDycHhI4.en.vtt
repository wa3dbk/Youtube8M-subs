00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.390
 expanded and even extended to north street 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 which has long been forgotten and that's basically 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.780
 shit nothing 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.149
 but you today I restored it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.610

 us right side and left side 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 and so now I will put you a spoiler 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 What about the subway here is some news to ask 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 subway even in the city already lives 10 thousand 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 residents here soon it is time to build 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 underground 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.790
 Well, that's the principle here we will pass 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.970
 ground line metro 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.860
 mod and here it will go inside and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.140
 either right or going straight 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 I will probably decide this later and even the subway 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.180
 I will build and now let's 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.740
 consider the beginning at the beginning of a residential building here 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 name wanted to build your cops 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.320
 real life only there in blocks not 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.540
 there were such there we had to type on 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.250
 Well imagination to build the series was 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.079
 lc 600 here you can download see in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
 principle drowned house outside here 5 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.110
 front floors 9 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.659
 so let's go around here as decided 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.340
 then I'll show you here 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.250
 there is a visor 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.340
 and let's go inside here we have 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.299
 the cashier who is sitting 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 classic standard small windows 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.990
 4 apartments as I said 12 bedrooms 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.720
 places on one floor here we have 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 the balcony is so glassy and nobody is here 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.920
 will not climb and jump too 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:11.190
 reigns state anti-thief well 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.739
 suicide no not that anti suicide so 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.200
 to have a table yet we have 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.080
 you like the kitchen like this apartment 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.319
 combined something like a studio here us 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.920
 months well , three more beds in principle all 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.959
 dates like on studio apartment here we go 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.330
 Further all the plans are the same. 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.569
 then the same apartment is also well worth it 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:39.590
 rise from different 9 floor so far this 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.590
 sleeps like a long time 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 so but open almost climbed already 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.469

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.209
 big window and exit to the roof here of us 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.079

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.930
 run or wires probably all such 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.219
