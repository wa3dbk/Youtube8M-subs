00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi friends in touch pashkin frazer and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.469
 so it turns out that the eternal 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.280
 there is nothing on earth like that and my machine 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.230
 started singing songs by longitudinal feed 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.699
 under load when if you put a vice 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.480
 or sine turntable then he 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.160
 roars uncontrollably and asks for repairs but 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
 ask repair it is not worth 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.759
 postpone this matter indefinitely and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.340
 need to repair immediately 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 as if not to do that process 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.370
 wear and tear can start to progress and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 this can lead to serious damage 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.700
 to repair the machine you need to prepare to remove 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.539
 all snap vice there that you have 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 cutting tool 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.660
 well then i had chip protection i 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.109
 I also removed the stop, I wiped it with a cloth and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.680
 around the machine, too, all cleaned chips are not 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.080
 should be when turning the flywheel 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 longitudinal feed 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 the sound was spreading 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.760
 resonated the table and the table started 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.670
 vibrate by about one hundred 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.460
 but we decided not to be limited to inspection 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.159
 only this node and produce some 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.680
 comprehensive so seek repair so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.490
 let's start the first thing unscrew the nuts 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.970
 table and recline our table for this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 you need to prepare a chair and so that the table 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.180
 do not fold to the floor further 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.380
 unscrew our protective covers 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.340
 machine and bring them to the side there 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.439
 wipe cleaned of chips on this 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.229
 stage, our stop looks like this 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.329
 here's the way everything is unscrewed and the elements 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.189
 we put on the table in a certain 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.829
 okay so as not to confuse and not 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.110
 confused me there is such 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.960
 the impression that the chips are milling 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.040
 machine on live it can crawl into 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 such corners 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.210
 where it would seem impossible 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 to crawl through 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.050
 we do the longitudinal feed and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.180
 find out that no load table at all 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.829
 sings 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.250
 but calm down on this we are not 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:20.620
 going and therefore unscrew the nut 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.569
 which drives our pillar 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.829
 for this we will use the calculation and 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.829
 choose the pins that fasten our nut 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.049
 we remove the table of the milling machine and here 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.260
 not the most beautiful exterior opens 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.569
 view 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.260
 shavings of course crammed enough 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.709
 many also show up on one 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.560
 badass appeared from the top rail 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:52.060
 these mm tease and ruthlessly sew and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.709
 we bring guides to a due look 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.700
 guides of the moving part are preserved 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.549
 in better condition and that means we 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.439
 thoroughly clean as well 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.560
 oil channels for lubrication 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:09.260
 You see how many chips have accumulated 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.709
 in some parts it all became 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.909
 wiped out wiped out well and slightly 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.609
 refreshed scraper now proceed to 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:23.599
 disassembling that node which i suspect 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:26.269
 at the source of noise and vibration for this 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.299
 we will use a stripper remove 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.519
 gear wheel 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.859
 remove key and shook hand roller I 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.109
 felt some benny my 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.409
 the assumptions were not in vain and 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.870
 I think this node is the one 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.479
 the most resonant component which 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.669
 appears on my machine 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:48.079
 parse the node further it does not cause 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.229
 no problem 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.590
 our mechanic clearly knows his stuff and 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:57.650
 pre-cooking take out bearings 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.709
 screw and look at his condition in the course 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.900
 case the nut is in excellent 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.560
 condition and and not even had to 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.229
 adjust by the way a bit and nuts in 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.359
 machines use a double nut like 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.579
 You see this one here, he mechanism 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.009
 allows you to adjust the clearance on the screw 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.359
 and thereby reduce or increase 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.659
 backlash on 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.300
 flywheel of one or another filing source 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:26.090
 vibration was found it was worn 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.659
 bearings and lack of lubrication in this 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.050
 knot 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:33.110
 the fact is that the design of such a machine 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 that this node does not have lubrication even 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.569
 it is impossible to lubricate this unit manually 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.270
 grease I understand there was no germ 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:46.699
 well we all have greased the bearings replaced and 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.610
 proceed to the assembly in reverse 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.479
 the direction of our machine set the table 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.000
 fasten it with nuts and set it up 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.250
 set with the indicator under 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.939
 load load in this case 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.370
 It is a vice that's all well and generally on 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:08.289
 this repair is completed thank you for your attention 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.289
 with respect Pashkin router
