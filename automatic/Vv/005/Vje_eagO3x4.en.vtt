light<00:00:17.730> has<00:00:18.240> always<00:00:18.600> fascinated<00:00:19.529> me<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:19.949> night

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
light has always fascinated me at night

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.910 
light has always fascinated me at night
our<00:00:20.789> cities<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.539> homes<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.230> brought<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.740> life

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
our cities and homes are brought to life

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.790 
our cities and homes are brought to life
by<00:00:23.189> duty<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> light<00:00:25.230> takes<00:00:25.650> an

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
by duty but all this light takes an

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
by duty but all this light takes an
amazing<00:00:26.400> amount<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> energy<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.750> gonna

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
amazing amount of energy I'm gonna

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.470 
amazing amount of energy I'm gonna
journey<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:28.920> how<00:00:29.070> LEDs<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.880> changing<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
journey to see how LEDs are changing the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540 
journey to see how LEDs are changing the
way<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.869> light<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.439> our<00:00:31.650> world<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.219> we're

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
way we light up our world and we're

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.250 
way we light up our world and we're
gonna<00:00:32.700> begin<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> fun

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.540 

what<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.440> told<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.340> actually

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
what if I told you that I can actually

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.700 
what if I told you that I can actually
show<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:38.969> how<00:00:39.570> these<00:00:39.780> lemons<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.500> produce

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
show you how these lemons can produce

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.590 
show you how these lemons can produce
electricity<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.579> light<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.030> bug<00:00:44.480> let<00:00:45.480> me

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
electricity and light up a bug let me

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.680 
electricity and light up a bug let me
prove<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> both<00:00:46.140> wrong<00:00:46.410> yes<00:00:46.860> fantastic<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
prove you both wrong yes fantastic it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
prove you both wrong yes fantastic it's
not<00:00:48.899> magic<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.340> science<00:00:51.980> we're<00:00:52.980> gonna

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
not magic it's just science we're gonna

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.869 
not magic it's just science we're gonna
need<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.610> diode<00:00:54.289> copper<00:00:55.289> strips<00:00:55.590> some<00:00:56.520> zinc

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
need a diode copper strips some zinc

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.779 
need a diode copper strips some zinc
covered<00:00:57.239> rings<00:00:57.800> electrical<00:00:58.800> wires<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
covered rings electrical wires and of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
covered rings electrical wires and of
course<00:01:00.620> some<00:01:01.620> lemons

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 

now<00:01:05.129> let's<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.150> lemon<00:01:06.540> lights

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
now let's see if this one lemon lights

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.090 
now let's see if this one lemon lights
up<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.290> diode<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> we'll<00:01:09.030> use<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.360> viewer

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
up the diode now we'll use the viewer

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.260 
up the diode now we'll use the viewer
know<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.160> there's<00:01:11.370> not<00:01:11.520> enough<00:01:11.580> electricity

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
know if there's not enough electricity

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.910 
know if there's not enough electricity
as<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.660> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> actually<00:01:13.470> light<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.800> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
as you can see to actually light up the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
as you can see to actually light up the
diodes<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:14.610> try<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:14.850> lemons<00:01:15.390> yeah

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
diodes let's try two lemons yeah

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880 
diodes let's try two lemons yeah
brilliant

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
brilliant

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
brilliant
let's<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.640> viewer<00:01:18.210> there<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
let's put it into the viewer there you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.150 
let's put it into the viewer there you
go<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.620> it's<00:01:19.770> slightly

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
go can you see that it's slightly

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.640 
go can you see that it's slightly
illuminated<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> say<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> used<00:01:22.440> four

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
illuminated what do you say we used four

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.920 
illuminated what do you say we used four
lemons<00:01:25.640> can<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.760> see<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.030> light<00:01:27.210> inside<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
lemons can you see the light inside of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.620 
lemons can you see the light inside of
the<00:01:28.020> viewer<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> diode<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> actually

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the viewer the diode is actually

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.180 
the viewer the diode is actually
lighting<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> that's<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> beauty<00:01:32.160> of

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
lighting up and that's the beauty of

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.450 
lighting up and that's the beauty of
LEDs<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.360> uses<00:01:33.780> less<00:01:33.990> power<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:35.010> generates

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
LEDs it uses less power but it generates

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.969 
LEDs it uses less power but it generates
the<00:01:35.760> same<00:01:36.060> light<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.869> 40<00:01:37.320> watt<00:01:37.470> incandescent

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the same light as a 40 watt incandescent

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.920 
the same light as a 40 watt incandescent
light<00:01:38.460> bulb<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:38.910> how<00:01:39.000> does<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.180> compare<00:01:39.300> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
light bulb but how does that compare and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.430 
light bulb but how does that compare and
lemon<00:01:40.350> power<00:01:41.000> if<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.330> lemons<00:01:42.810> represents

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
lemon power if these lemons represents

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.499 
lemon power if these lemons represents
the<00:01:43.560> amount<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.979> power<00:01:44.250> consumed<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:45.119> LED

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the amount of power consumed by an LED

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
the amount of power consumed by an LED
bulb<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:46.080> incandescent<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:47.280> consume<00:01:47.700> eight

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
bulb an incandescent will consume eight

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.560 
bulb an incandescent will consume eight
times<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:49.009> switch<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.220> philips<00:01:50.490> LED<00:01:50.910> use

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
times more switch to philips LED use

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.660 
times more switch to philips LED use
less<00:01:51.869> juice<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.500> save<00:01:52.710> hundreds<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.160> dollars

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.120 

and<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:57.360> our<00:01:57.539> next<00:01:57.750> episode<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.740> compare

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and on our next episode we compare

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
and on our next episode we compare
incandescent<00:01:59.729> bulbs<00:02:00.240> versus<00:02:00.810> LEDs<00:02:01.350> using
