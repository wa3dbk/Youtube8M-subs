00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the eyes that was taught to me by the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
the eyes that was taught to me by the
book<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.180> will<00:00:48.450> force<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> eyes<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.680> follow

it<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.449> that<00:00:51.449> was<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> pretty<00:00:51.780> cool<00:00:51.989> thing<00:00:52.260> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it and that was a pretty cool thing I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
it and that was a pretty cool thing I
didn't<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.300> we<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.480> inverse

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

kinematics<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> hands<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.270> move

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
kinematics on the hands so when we move

the<00:00:57.480> hand<00:00:57.809> everything<00:00:58.320> moves<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.949> hand

up<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> shoulder<00:01:00.710> it's<00:01:01.710> quite<00:01:01.920> nice<00:01:02.100> makes

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
up to the shoulder it's quite nice makes

that<00:01:02.879> animation<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> little<00:01:03.510> different<00:01:03.780> I'm

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that animation a little different I'm

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
that animation a little different I'm
just<00:01:04.379> showing<00:01:04.530> off<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> fist

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
a another view similar to the 3d view

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
a another view similar to the 3d view
and<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.119> playing<00:01:21.479> around<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and this is me playing around with the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.910 
and this is me playing around with the
leg<00:01:22.259> by<00:01:22.680> using<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> foot<00:01:23.790> controller

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
leg by using the foot controller

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
leg by using the foot controller
unfortunately<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.610> leg<00:01:27.119> does<00:01:27.420> some<00:01:27.570> weird

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
unfortunately the leg does some weird

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
unfortunately the leg does some weird
stuff<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> figure<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.740> what

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
stuff and I have to figure out what

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
stuff and I have to figure out what
constraints<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.909> put<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> bone<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
constraints i can put on that bone to

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
constraints i can put on that bone to
keep<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.890> natural-looking<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
keep it more natural-looking so it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260 
keep it more natural-looking so it
doesn't<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.290> alien<00:01:35.119> although<00:01:36.119> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
doesn't look like an alien although it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.670 
doesn't look like an alien although it's
a<00:01:36.360> zombie<00:01:36.630> maybe<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.259> away<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
a zombie maybe I can get away with it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.770 
a zombie maybe I can get away with it
and<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.670> picking<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.240> other<00:01:39.390> foot<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and just picking up the other foot the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.310 
and just picking up the other foot the
place<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:41.600> going<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.899> up<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
face and just rotating the zombie around
just<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> show<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.770> painted<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.250> all

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
