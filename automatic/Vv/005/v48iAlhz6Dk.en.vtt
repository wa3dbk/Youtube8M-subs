00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
see what it actually started out as when

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.180

I got it

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.100 
I got it
since<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.430> wheels<00:00:55.730> were<00:00:55.969> especially<00:00:56.390> crushed

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
since the wheels were especially crushed

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.000 
since the wheels were especially crushed
to<00:00:57.260> crap<00:00:57.469> I<00:00:57.770> had<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:59.379> come<00:01:00.379> up<00:01:00.410> with<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.770> way<00:01:00.949> to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
to crap I had to come up with a way to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.040 
to crap I had to come up with a way to
mount<00:01:01.309> standard<00:01:02.120> wheels<00:01:02.329> because<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.870> wheels

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
mount standard wheels because the wheels

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.360 
mount standard wheels because the wheels
that<00:01:03.260> were<00:01:03.379> on<00:01:03.530> it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.500 

these<00:01:10.610> big<00:01:10.850> slide<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:12.250> opinion<00:01:13.250> huge<00:01:13.940> axles

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
these big slide in opinion huge axles

and stuff like that

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.010

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
the way through that yet if I'm honest

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.190 
the way through that yet if I'm honest
probably<00:05:07.980> going<00:05:08.700> to<00:05:08.880> be<00:05:09.030> some<00:05:09.330> bungee<00:05:09.540> cords

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
probably going to be some bungee cords

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.930 
probably going to be some bungee cords
and<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:12.900> little<00:05:13.560> stretchy<00:05:13.890> cargo<00:05:14.460> nets<00:05:14.670> out<00:05:14.790> of

and a little stretchy cargo nets out of
the<00:05:15.000> trunk<00:05:15.300> or<00:05:15.480> something<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.870> that<00:05:16.940> so

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
the trunk or something like that so

the trunk or something like that so
there's<00:05:18.150> there's<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.020> basic<00:05:19.620> walk-around<00:05:20.160> of

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
there's there's a basic walk-around of

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
was found in the garbage just to screw

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.070 
was found in the garbage just to screw
into<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:14.180> fitting<00:06:15.180> here<00:06:15.540> and<00:06:15.690> make<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.870> good

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
of the swivel caster I'll just show you

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.450 
of the swivel caster I'll just show you
how<00:06:22.050> quick<00:06:22.289> this<00:06:22.500> quick<00:06:23.070> connect<00:06:23.340> works<00:06:23.610> it's

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
how quick this quick connect works it's

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.140 
how quick this quick connect works it's
there<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.610> go<00:06:27.340> now<00:06:28.340> we<00:06:28.670> can<00:06:28.850> get<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:29.000> little

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
there you go now we can get a little

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.540 
there you go now we can get a little
better<00:06:29.360> look<00:06:29.570> at<00:06:29.660> the<00:06:29.750> hitch<00:06:30.250> so<00:06:31.250> here's<00:06:31.460> your

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
better look at the hitch so here's your

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.150 
better look at the hitch so here's your
hitch<00:06:31.780> quick<00:06:32.780> connect<00:06:33.080> their<00:06:33.350> standard

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
hitch quick connect their standard

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.800 
hitch quick connect their standard
arrows<00:06:34.490> connect<00:06:34.880> seems<00:06:35.120> to<00:06:35.210> be<00:06:35.300> pretty<00:06:35.540> strong

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
arrows connect seems to be pretty strong

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.320 
arrows connect seems to be pretty strong
it's<00:06:36.170> all<00:06:36.260> new<00:06:36.530> so<00:06:36.920> it's<00:06:37.070> not<00:06:37.220> worn<00:06:38.060> out<00:06:38.210> and

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
it's all new so it's not worn out and

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.320 
it's all new so it's not worn out and
sloppy<00:06:38.630> yet<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.400> here's<00:06:40.400> a<00:06:40.460> standard<00:06:40.730> swivel

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
sloppy yet and here's a standard swivel

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.370 
sloppy yet and here's a standard swivel
caster<00:06:41.950> the<00:06:42.950> idea<00:06:43.340> behind<00:06:43.550> that<00:06:43.910> is<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:45.230> it

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
caster the idea behind that is that it

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.820 
caster the idea behind that is that it
handles<00:06:45.800> pitch<00:06:46.130> on<00:06:46.760> the<00:06:46.910> trailer<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:48.340> yaw<00:06:49.340> and

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
handles pitch on the trailer and yaw and

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.380 
handles pitch on the trailer and yaw and
the<00:06:52.720> air<00:06:53.720> hose<00:06:53.930> connector<00:06:54.530> does<00:06:54.920> roll<00:06:55.640> so<00:06:56.210> the

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
the air hose connector does roll so the

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.790 
the air hose connector does roll so the
trailer<00:06:56.810> can<00:06:57.050> can<00:06:57.890> pitch<00:06:58.160> and<00:06:58.490> yaw<00:06:58.640> and<00:06:58.970> roll

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
trailer can can pitch and yaw and roll

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.130 
trailer can can pitch and yaw and roll
in<00:07:00.800> any<00:07:01.010> direction<00:07:01.340> and<00:07:01.790> within<00:07:02.570> a<00:07:02.720> reasonable
