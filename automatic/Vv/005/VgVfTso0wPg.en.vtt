00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.820
 came from another coach space 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.889
 gadget dedicated to technology thanks 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.680
 moreover, I have not yet done it frankly 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.750
 mondini for the realization of the new one 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.150
 graphic video of mister gadget you have 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.970
 since in short it is part of a project 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.439
 more extensive than that which concerns 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.130
 graphic impact of mister gadgets e 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.989
 thanks also to you who already have it 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.460
 noticed you have sent several messages 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.149
 about 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.840
 just a few minutes to enter the topic 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.899
 of a product that I have had for weeks in 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.390
 try and I have to tell you that I tried it one 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.850
 absentmindedly because he was never attracted 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.079
 actually from from the object is actually 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.949
 today where names are submitted for review 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.070
 of the surface of microsoft I find you 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.320
 honestly a little in trouble in the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 sense that I really like the subject of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 Tablet 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.590
 regarding technology today a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
 layout 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.440
 but I believe that on microsoft surface there 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.920
 is a very and above all a topic 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.170
 very particular topic to be addressed e 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 above all it is very difficult to make one 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.840
 review within a few minutes 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.640
 of a product of this type perhaps with 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.520
 meanwhile we can go to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.290
 see what the general impact of a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.080
 product that in short is enough 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 generous in weight I showed it 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.230
 especially on that we see open and 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.940
 already laid by leaning on his 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.650
 support in corporate and product 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.850
 it is really special in the meantime because 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.710
 however, the advantages are also very heavy 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.900
 very obvious 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 we see meanwhile what is characterized 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.569
 connection volume key 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.470
 headphones a small speaker on 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.390
 top 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.050
 again for the release of music and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 then the power button on the side 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.760
 opposite you see the USB and then the connector 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.110
 for charging again speaker for 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.700
 as regards this part instead e 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.060
 then there is micro usb of course and then 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.550
 this part instead characterized by 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.350
 this connection dedicated to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.140
 keyboards there are two types one 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.050
 keyboard that with this soft impact e 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 a more rigid one opening or playing 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.560
 keyboard because in reality it would be the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.630
 cover but I can't seem unidentified 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.959
 like a keyboard for how it's made 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.810
 I learn the cover in practice and activate it 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.140
 also this support fuster 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.130
 back in practice you have a true e 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.570
 own pc is ready for use 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.950
 because I say that it is very difficult 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.350
 according to me judge this product 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.290
 meanwhile you know that there are two versions 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.090
 a rte version a pro la version 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.940
 r r version pro si radiation 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.769
 essentially differentiate for what 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.590
 you have available for the type of 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.340
 processor you have inside the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.620
 product 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.180
 and here I think there is going great 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.480
 crossroads that 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.799
 makes a review difficult indeed 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.840
 many of you have asked me to see 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.299
 a little short, how this works 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.269
 essentially produced this the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.280
 start button that a bit like the button 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.329
 central windows 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.790
 you have this part that is the one here 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.290
 now we are not used to m tiles 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.989
 of windows 8 and then there is also the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.500
 part that you wouldn't expect on a 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.209
 tablet that this is the part 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.220
 desktop what is the feature that you 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.169
 here you can really install 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.060
 whatever there is this is a true e 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.799
 own computer 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.870
 and this in my opinion the difficulty in 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.549
 make an evaluation that I would postpone 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.560
 again these are just a video 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.169
 propaedeutic to show you a little the type 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.989
 this very convenient feature 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.540
 keyboard because all the controls that alone 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.660
 on the 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.760
 which are on the tablet are shown 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.680
 practically precisely and punctually 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.360
 also on the keyboard and I must say that 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 this is really convenient especially 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.670
 when you have a very precise place where 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.080
 support them you know it for example in 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.240
 hotel on the move in the hotel 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.250
 you have a small table at your airport 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.530
 a situation where you have one 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.080
 quite comfortable situation e 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.060
 use this instead of a 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.520
 computer is however very difficult to give one 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.800
 evaluation I said why if I have to 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.890
 I compare it to the other tablets 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.600
 this is not a tablet in my opinion from 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.240
 my point of view for complexity 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 for the type of product you are 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.340
 represent 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.770
 I challenge you to find the settings 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.080
 of the wifi in this object has some 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.270
 features so if we see it 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.360
 from the point of view of a tablet that is the 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.060
 competition to the ipad or a galaxy 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.880
 note 10.1 to the tablet z of the Esperia 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.010
 I think it's a drama, there's a product 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.200
 that just can't compete with that 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.690
 kind of products if we see it 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.070
 like a real computer like 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.740
 what we all have on the desk 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.430
 reduced days in the space of a 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.560
 Tablet 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.850
 then we talk about a product 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.030
 awesome 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.320
 the point is what you look for when you go to 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.200
 buy an item of this kind in 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.060
 so let's say a store in a word 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.760
 still need some time for 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.830
 understand this microsoft surface that well 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.520
 it's really a very product 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.110
 particular 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.790
 we will certainly talk about it again 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.790
 coming days here at mister gadget
