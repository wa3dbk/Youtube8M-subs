00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 I get the feeling that the party 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.549
 I finish the pumas team the best 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.990
 chaco missions to the lion that gave him the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.610
 ball in the end or a team that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 is playing at home if he is winning and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.910
 everything is a valuable victory a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.549
 victory that gets it I think third 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.990
 now in the general table but gave him 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.060
 the ball to the cougars in the end or 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
 the team did not have it if it was about 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.130
 be dangerous with some pitch in the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.630
 final 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 that is how it is seen what it is saying 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.720
 true because it gets to play the line of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.050
 three tears many phase some 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.789
 forward to give account that the account 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 matosas that ends up taking a rock and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.110
 puts back such a good striker 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
 terms with the two forward exactly 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 to this the lion of rose with this campaign 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.310
 against breast cancer 'pikolin' 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 also that he had an extraordinary 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.790
 performance of the goalkeeper if it is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.590
 not the previous party also pulled a 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.970
 pair of important balls the floor of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 first time he pulled a couple of them with 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.410
 the foot mostly seems to me that when 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.900
 better he did cougars and he had the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.850
 kickback the lion reacted well the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.530
 archer some say that he is wrong not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the goal that ends up being 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.580
 practically on the end of the first 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.800
 after this time was the rock street 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.479
 it seems that it is fulfilling and is 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.100
 saving in important moments manolo 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.190
 herrera worked tito to the bank and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.040
 Herrera raising her hand inside 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.040
 in front 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.729
 in this the goalkeeper is wrong as he says 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.229
 also for me it goes well and then 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.820
 comes back and grabs him halfway to the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.700
 goal and dream for me if he makes a mistake 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 artist and for me while the doorman or 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.730
 be while a defense has the slight 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.060
 possibility 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.920
 the goalkeeper has no idea left - handed 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.320
 he was uncomfortable and had been closing his 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.840
 defense and stay in your goal leave it 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.560
 how strong with the left covers it 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.770
 the same with a shot from a distance 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.920
 great definition that is now inclusive 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.200
 this note there were two people inside the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.210
 goal 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 even if he lets it go through the whole saga 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.480
 in them because he touched her and it's Daniel 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.860
 impressive what plays mountains in 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.649
 this moment I listened to the 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.790
 transmission and santiago bridge very attentive 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.040
 what's going on the court the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.390
 anticipated a little while before and mounts 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.390
 I was playing behind the front
