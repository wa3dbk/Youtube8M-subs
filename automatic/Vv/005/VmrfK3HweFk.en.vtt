00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.310
 always in wines once again to the garage 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 of the frame polisher on this occasion 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.890
 We are going to present and demonstrate the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 product frame clean air wax this is a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.500
 product really is a wax of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.900
 cleaning and protection in the mode of 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.809
 application is very easy and you can 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.629
 apply either to moat or with politice 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.900
 vital rotor what we are going to demonstrate is 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.390
 the brightness and in a way the mask 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.100
 that the wax has since she's going 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.780
 to learn any orography or 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
 any micro risk that the car 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.989
 can get to do the procedure is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 very simple manual wax is passed in a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 beret or in a preference applicator 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.280
 a little aggressive so you can 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.410
 really clean the oxidation and the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.899
 cloth marks may have the can 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.090
 in the case of application with poly trias 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.100
 Orbital photo is going to apply a cheese 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.040
 of product in each good we go to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.560
 work the area and we will review and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.600
 compare the surface before and after 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.209
 first let's do the section with 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 poly trees we are going to withdraw the appointments 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.200
 to see the difference 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 and then we're going to match the weight with the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 application by hand the knees that we are going 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.130
 to use in this demonstration is the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 green beret that is a good foam 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.479
 with a fine cutting power with this 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 let's apply wax frame binner wax 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.679
 We are going to apply two product chips in 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.679
 each beret 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.469
 for an area more or less than 60 x 60 40 x 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.539
 40 would be the right thing 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.030
 procedure is the same we would be the 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.549
 product and then we will illustrate the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.740
 weighs to be able to check the power of 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.670
 cleaning and detachment of micro 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.670
 risks of holography 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.680
 shortly after the silk burst 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.590
 uniformly we will proceed to raise 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.860
 the turn of politics in the case of the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.319
 cycle 'the maximum speed that marks 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.110
 on the clock at number 6 for that 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.150
 way to clean all the oxidation 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.110
 brand of corduroy and holography that can 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 have the weights 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.820
 after having applied the wax and 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.980
 have given a few passes with the politice 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.890
 for cleaning the oxidation and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.240
 micro risks or bread craps or are we going to 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.730
 replace the coils 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.630
 fine cut are green give to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.160
 club and let's place the good super 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.580
 macÃ­as of white color so that with this 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 we are going to cover the berets with 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.880
 microfiber botnets and this we 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.480
 will allow to remove the wax and at the same 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.870
 time to give a perfect luster without having 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.940
 the risk of damaging or inducing more 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.940
 marks of what I already had 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.250
 with this we can see that after 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.070
 have removed the wax the same policy 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.620
 is giving luster with the good or the 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.600
 Microfiber bones are going to be able 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.480
 perceive that on top of the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.060
 capo we have a sharper shine and the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.150
 cleaner paint on the bottom 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.490
 is ainda with holography marks of 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.380
 previous polish and the piece is in 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.620
 a state can be called that has a 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.210
 boa that does not allow perfect reflection 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:42.170
 it means that the wax clean and pressed 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.980
 the politice marks of a pavement 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:49.700
 badly before posh that we go 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.820
 to continue applying the wax with a 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.850
 a bit more aggressive beret or a 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.040
 we will do it manually and go 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.030
 to be able to see that he has the same 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.960
 result 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.810
 we are going to apply a normal amount and the 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.139
 application let's try to make it 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.830
 preference in 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:14.039
 lines for that way in case of 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.050
 have any attentive orography leave 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.439
 the marks on the line so there's no 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.080
 a reflection of light in the form of an arch 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:25.789
 iris that would be what most commonly 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.789
 we have what are holograms 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.830
 is the application we are going to remove the wax 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.100
 normally with a microfiber task 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.160
 from the more aggressive side for the removal 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.970
 wax and then we will look at the 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.670
 towel 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.670
 on the empty side for a luster 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.950
 include not require any 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.550
 waiting time for removal since 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.550
 It is a wax of cleaning power and 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:08.150
 Power protection is the application is 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.980
 the easiest of all application 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:16.250
 removal what in the world the beat of 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.250
 air is known as balloon watson workshop 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.610
 with this we finished the presentation and 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:38.370
 nano frame show cleaner wax 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:41.949
 I want to be 20 emphatic in failing that 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:45.610
 marked a line that is a sidewalk of 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:49.210
 limpeza with protection what does it mean 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.710
 this that has no abrasive power out there 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:56.139
 does not remove cliffs or holography 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.240
 it only covers the ace and press and 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.360
 any micro-cliff that weighs it 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.300
 have however if you clean the piece and 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.550
 the varnish of any oxidation e 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.400
 impurities that the piece has leaving a 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:12.419
 protection three to four months 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.580
 depending a lot on the maintenance 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:17.680
 educate with this I say goodbye one more time 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:22.529
 of voices and I wait for you in the next
