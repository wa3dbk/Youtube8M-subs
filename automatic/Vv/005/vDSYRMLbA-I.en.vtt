00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
really noticed about this figure that I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
really noticed about this figure that I
was<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.610> impressed<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.600> how

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
was really impressed with is just how

much possible an interest in looking is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
much possible an interest in looking is
I<00:00:37.020> mean<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.500> doesn't<00:00:37.710> just<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I mean it doesn't just look like a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.569 
I mean it doesn't just look like a
robotic<00:00:39.710> dinosaur<00:00:40.710> he<00:00:40.860> looks<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
robotic dinosaur he looks just like a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.709 
robotic dinosaur he looks just like a
very<00:00:42.800> mean-looking<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> Rex<00:00:44.450> especially<00:00:45.450> when

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
very mean-looking to Rex especially when

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.459 
very mean-looking to Rex especially when
his<00:00:46.050> uh<00:00:46.280> get<00:00:47.280> him<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.879> very<00:00:48.539> dynamic<00:00:48.870> pose

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
his uh get him in a very dynamic pose

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.900 
his uh get him in a very dynamic pose
such<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> thing<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.309> because

uh<00:01:22.880> my<00:01:23.880> only<00:01:24.270> complaint<00:01:24.900> about<00:01:25.290> him<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
uh my only complaint about him in this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
uh my only complaint about him in this
mode<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
mode is I just really don't like the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.469 
mode is I just really don't like the
color

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
color

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
color
that's<00:01:30.479> greening<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.409> purple<00:01:31.950> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that's greening with purple and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
that's greening with purple and
different<00:01:32.970> shades<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.360> green<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> gold<00:01:33.900> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
different shades of green and gold it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.050 
different shades of green and gold it
just<00:01:35.009> doesn't<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.400> natural

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just doesn't look natural

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.140 
just doesn't look natural
I<00:01:37.820> like<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.140> version<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.520> 10th<00:01:41.909> anniversary

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I like the version the 10th anniversary

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.749 
I like the version the 10th anniversary
Megatron<00:01:43.049> version<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.340> simple

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
Megatron version that's just a simple

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
Megatron version that's just a simple
purple<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:46.159> think<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> looked<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> lot<00:01:47.700> better

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
purple I think that looked a lot better

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.050 
purple I think that looked a lot better
than<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.040> ugly<00:01:50.250> green<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
than this it's just a very ugly green I

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.010 
than this it's just a very ugly green I
don't<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:52.850> like<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.450> much<00:01:54.630> but

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
don't really like it all that much but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.160 
don't really like it all that much but
the<00:01:55.439> figure<00:01:55.710> itself<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> fantastic<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the figure itself is fantastic just the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.410 
the figure itself is fantastic just the
color<00:01:58.500> especially<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> robot<00:01:59.729> mode<00:01:59.759> in<00:02:00.180> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
color especially in the robot mode in a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
color especially in the robot mode in a
certain<00:02:00.750> part<00:02:01.020> which<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:02.040> don't<00:02:02.189> like

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
certain part which I really don't like

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.859 
certain part which I really don't like
how<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> show<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.689> second<00:02:05.750> speaking<00:02:06.750> out

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
how I show in a second speaking out

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.880 
how I show in a second speaking out
let's<00:02:07.020> get<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.320> right<00:02:07.560> now

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
let's get that right now

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.910 
let's get that right now
the<00:02:08.280> transformation<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.410> remarkably<00:02:10.410> similar

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the transformation is remarkably similar

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.320 
the transformation is remarkably similar
to<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
to the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.460 
to the
original<00:02:14.330> these<00:02:15.260> four<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.620> Megatron<00:02:15.920> fee<00:02:16.310> here

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
original these four is Megatron fee here

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.589 
original these four is Megatron fee here
just<00:02:18.470> take<00:02:18.709> these<00:02:18.830> panels<00:02:19.280> here<00:02:19.459> slide<00:02:20.450> them

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599

also known as review 64 all right the
back<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.340> figure<00:05:09.669> rose<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.180> had<00:05:10.330> okay<00:05:10.990> so<00:05:11.830> but

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
back to figure rose I had okay so but

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.360 
back to figure rose I had okay so but
now<00:05:12.190> we<00:05:12.250> have<00:05:12.520> him<00:05:12.550> fully<00:05:13.320> transformed<00:05:14.370> his

now we have him fully transformed his

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.689 
now we have him fully transformed his
tail<00:05:16.030> arm<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.889> little<00:05:17.889> awkward

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
tail arm is a little awkward

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.920 
tail arm is a little awkward
but<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.830> can<00:05:21.039> solve<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.580> after<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.120> get<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.419> his

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
but you can solve it after I get to his

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.379 
but you can solve it after I get to his
horse<00:05:23.560> chip<00:05:24.330> cyber<00:05:25.330> planet<00:05:25.720> key<00:05:26.320> gimmick<00:05:27.389> just

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
horse chip cyber planet key gimmick just

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.100 
horse chip cyber planet key gimmick just
uh<00:05:28.570> put<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.139> in<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:29.500> slot<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:30.960> there's<00:05:31.960> this

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
uh put that in a slot and there's this

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.129 
uh put that in a slot and there's this
weapon<00:05:32.470> you<00:05:32.590> can<00:05:32.740> use<00:05:32.949> this<00:05:33.159> in<00:05:33.750> t-rex<00:05:34.750> mode<00:05:35.020> as

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
weapon you can use this in t-rex mode as

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.050 
weapon you can use this in t-rex mode as
well<00:05:35.320> but<00:05:35.500> I<00:05:35.560> think<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:36.070> just<00:05:36.219> makes<00:05:36.759> more

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
well but I think it just makes more

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.620 
well but I think it just makes more
sense<00:05:37.389> to<00:05:37.599> use<00:05:37.780> it<00:05:37.930> in<00:05:38.050> robot<00:05:38.380> mode<00:05:38.580> as<00:05:39.580> if<00:05:40.479> the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
sense to use it in robot mode as if the

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.570 
sense to use it in robot mode as if the
whole<00:05:40.810> thing<00:05:41.020> makes<00:05:41.199> sense<00:05:41.469> at<00:05:41.590> all<00:05:42.599> all<00:05:43.599> right

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
whole thing makes sense at all all right

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.459 
whole thing makes sense at all all right
but<00:05:45.580> if<00:05:45.909> you<00:05:46.180> don't<00:05:46.389> really<00:05:46.570> like<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.050> look<00:05:47.080> of

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
but if you don't really like the look of

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.100 
but if you don't really like the look of
the<00:05:47.650> tail<00:05:47.979> arm<00:05:48.280> which<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.880> don't<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.900> can

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
the tail arm which I don't you can

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.180 
the tail arm which I don't you can
cleverly<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:51.370> catch<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.930> reveals<00:05:53.590> a<00:05:53.860> kind

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
cleverly to catch it and reveals a kind

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.070 
cleverly to catch it and reveals a kind
of<00:05:54.280> deformed<00:05:54.849> looking<00:05:55.120> call<00:05:55.360> even<00:05:55.990> though

of deformed looking call even though

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.850 
of deformed looking call even though
it's<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.349> little<00:05:56.650> bit<00:05:57.449> weird

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
it's a little bit weird

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.200 
it's a little bit weird
looks<00:05:59.860> more<00:05:59.949> like<00:06:00.190> looks<00:06:00.760> kinda<00:06:01.000> like<00:06:01.090> that

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
looks more like looks kinda like that

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.890

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
looks a lot better than the tail
