00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
it's been a weird morning I came out

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.249 
it's been a weird morning I came out
today<00:00:02.850> because<00:00:03.030> it's<00:00:03.270> perfect<00:00:03.750> frog<00:00:03.990> day

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259

overcast little light rain and they

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.990 
overcast little light rain and they
really<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.250> lake<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> thought

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
really like it on this lake so I thought

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.030 
really like it on this lake so I thought
I'd<00:00:09.179> get<00:00:09.389> something<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:09.929> after<00:00:10.440> 45<00:00:10.830> minutes

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
I'd get something but after 45 minutes

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.339 
I'd get something but after 45 minutes
or<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.340> without<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.639> bite<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.240> picked<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.139> wacky

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
or so without a bite I picked up a wacky

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.760 
or so without a bite I picked up a wacky
worm<00:00:13.849> and<00:00:14.849> cut<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> few<00:00:15.360> oh<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.379> obviously

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
worm and cut a few oh so obviously

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.080 
worm and cut a few oh so obviously
they're<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:16.980> quite<00:00:17.279> aggressive<00:00:17.789> enough<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
they're not quite aggressive enough to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.630 
they're not quite aggressive enough to
come<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> Frog<00:00:18.810> moving<00:00:19.289> fast<00:00:19.529> today<00:00:19.800> so

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
come up on the Frog moving fast today so

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730 
come up on the Frog moving fast today so
that's<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> had<00:00:21.270> try<00:00:21.539> something<00:00:22.380> more

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
that's all I had try something more

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
that's all I had try something more
subtle<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.460> going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> use<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> Donovan<00:00:24.630> no

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
subtle I'm going to use a Donovan no

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
subtle I'm going to use a Donovan no
splashing<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.130> favorite<00:00:26.519> popper

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
splashing one of my favorite popper

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.519 
splashing one of my favorite popper
style<00:00:27.180> Bates<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.840> let's<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.320> how<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.439> works

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
style Bates and let's see how it works

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.550 
style Bates and let's see how it works
out<00:00:29.000> what<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> really<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.960> splash

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
out what I really like about this splash

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.130 
out what I really like about this splash
it<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> very<00:00:32.790> subtle<00:00:33.090> sound<00:00:33.540> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
it is that it's a very subtle sound you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
it is that it's a very subtle sound you
can<00:00:34.170> work<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.559> hard<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.809> accepting<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.870> lot

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
can work it hard and accepting a lot

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.780 
can work it hard and accepting a lot
like<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> pop<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.460> just

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
like a pop are but you can also just

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
like a pop are but you can also just
pull<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.660> got<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> real<00:00:40.200> soft<00:00:40.469> sound

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
pull it and it's got a real soft sound

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.930 
pull it and it's got a real soft sound
like<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.940> come<00:00:42.180> up<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.450> eat<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
like that and they come up and eat it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.660 
like that and they come up and eat it
that<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> wrong<00:00:45.450> species<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> still<00:00:47.520> it's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that is the wrong species but still it's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.529 
that is the wrong species but still it's
a<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:49.430> looks<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.640> maybe<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.270> may<00:00:51.480> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
a good side looks like maybe that may be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.760 
a good side looks like maybe that may be
what<00:00:51.840> we're<00:00:51.960> looking<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
what we're looking for something a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.020 
what we're looking for something a
little<00:00:52.829> more<00:00:53.010> subtle<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> still<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.739> top<00:00:59.030> okay

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
little more subtle but still on top okay

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:11.780 
little more subtle but still on top okay
not<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> bad<00:01:00.780> crappie<00:01:01.050> though<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> looks<00:01:11.640> like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
not a bad crappie though it looks like

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.710 
not a bad crappie though it looks like
that<00:01:11.970> might<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.330> been<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> right

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that might have been the right

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520 
that might have been the right
adjustment<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> monster<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
adjustment on a monster but that's a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:29.630 
adjustment on a monster but that's a
good<00:01:16.770> mean<00:01:17.100> issue<00:01:27.740> of<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> healthy<00:01:29.159> respect<00:01:29.490> for

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
good mean issue of a healthy respect for

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
good mean issue of a healthy respect for
those<00:01:29.820> hooks<00:01:30.119> they've<00:01:30.360> got<00:01:30.509> some<00:01:30.780> sharpest<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
those hooks they've got some sharpest on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.640 
those hooks they've got some sharpest on
the<00:01:32.329> planet<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.509> their<00:01:33.780> coming<00:01:34.170> straight<00:01:34.470> from

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the planet on their coming straight from

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.789 
the planet on their coming straight from
the<00:01:34.799> factory<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:36.930> cook<00:01:37.560> cut

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the factory I had to have one cook cut

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
the factory I had to have one cook cut
out<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.130> entire<00:01:38.280> career<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> came<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
out my entire career and it came from a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
out my entire career and it came from a
splash<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.750> what's<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> telling<00:01:43.140> us<00:01:44.329> what

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
splash it so what's that telling us what

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.580 
splash it so what's that telling us what
that's<00:01:45.509> telling<00:01:45.720> us<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.259> they

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that's telling us is that they

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.870 
that's telling us is that they
definitely<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.130> something<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.610> more

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
definitely want something a little more

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.440 
definitely want something a little more
subtle<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:49.409> frog<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.950> too<00:01:50.130> fast<00:01:50.450> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
subtle that frog was too fast the

subtle that frog was too fast the
poppers<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.290> subtle<00:01:52.530> little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
poppers a little more subtle little

poppers a little more subtle little
slower<00:01:53.670> give<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.450> little<00:01:54.570> more<00:01:54.689> time<00:01:55.110> to

slower give them a little more time to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.080 
slower give them a little more time to
look<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> let's<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.549> some<00:01:56.729> more

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:15.729 

oh<00:02:07.849> that's<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.060> we've<00:02:09.179> been<00:02:09.269> looking<00:02:09.420> for

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:26.420 

would<00:02:16.739> he<00:02:16.890> joked<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:24.500> that's<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.099> we<00:02:26.220> like<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
would he joked it that's what we like to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:38.360 
would he joked it that's what we like to
see<00:02:35.150> hmm<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> good<00:02:37.680> example<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:38.190> what

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
see hmm there is a good example of what

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
see hmm there is a good example of what
happens<00:02:38.400> he<00:02:39.180> hit<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.420> knocked<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.049> up<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.349> the

happens he hit it knocked it up in the
air<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.670> then<00:02:41.940> came<00:02:42.269> back<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.110> be

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
air and then came back on it so be

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.069
