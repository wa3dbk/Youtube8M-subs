while we're driving eat while we're
cleaning<00:01:28.810> house<00:01:29.110> I<00:01:29.289> could<00:01:29.500> be<00:01:29.619> guilty<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:29.950> this

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
cleaning house I could be guilty of this

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.680 
cleaning house I could be guilty of this
I<00:01:30.369> mean<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.580> think<00:01:30.670> everybody<00:01:31.209> does<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.599> if

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
I mean I think everybody does it if

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.730 
I mean I think everybody does it if
they're<00:01:31.840> actually<00:01:32.140> honest<00:01:32.440> with<00:01:32.590> themselves

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
they're actually honest with themselves

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.219 
they're actually honest with themselves
and<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.759> you<00:01:34.119> don't<00:01:34.330> taste<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.780> food<00:01:34.959> that

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
and so you don't taste the food that

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.139 
and so you don't taste the food that
you're<00:01:35.440> eating<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.340> problem<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:36.970> don't

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
you're eating that's a problem you don't

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.249 
you're eating that's a problem you don't
enjoy<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.630> much<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.959> leads<00:01:38.140> to

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
enjoy it so much it leads to

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.139 
enjoy it so much it leads to
gastrointestinal<00:01:38.920> distress<00:01:39.550> but<00:01:39.910> another

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
gastrointestinal distress but another

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.850 
gastrointestinal distress but another
thing<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:40.690> leads<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.140> overeating<00:01:41.470> I've

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
thing is it leads to overeating I've

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.440 
thing is it leads to overeating I've
been<00:01:42.039> saying<00:01:42.220> this<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.610> years<00:01:42.819> and<00:01:43.179> there<00:01:43.420> are

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
been saying this for years and there are

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.210 
been saying this for years and there are
some<00:01:43.810> studies<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.380> including<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.770> recent<00:01:44.920> one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
some studies of including a recent one

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.979 
some studies of including a recent one
I'm<00:01:45.340> going<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.490> report<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.300> shows

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989

that<00:01:47.229> people<00:01:47.619> eat<00:01:48.069> more<00:01:48.399> when<00:01:49.119> they<00:01:49.270> eat<00:01:49.479> fast

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
that people eat more when they eat fast

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.940 
that people eat more when they eat fast
and<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:50.770> they<00:01:51.099> don't<00:01:51.280> chew<00:01:51.459> their<00:01:51.610> food<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.950> in

the amount of food that the men consumed
later<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.870> was<00:02:30.989> just<00:02:31.349> as<00:02:31.500> important<00:02:32.069> as

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
later and it was just as important as

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.890 
later and it was just as important as
the<00:02:32.430> amount<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.879> food<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.180> was<00:02:33.480> infused

tube<00:02:35.640> fed<00:02:35.940> while<00:02:36.239> chewing<00:02:36.629> I<00:02:36.989> know<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
tube fed while chewing I know that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.559 
tube fed while chewing I know that
sounds<00:02:37.739> real<00:02:37.950> complicated<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.269> bottom

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
sounds real complicated but the bottom

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.930 
sounds real complicated but the bottom
line<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.260> chewing<00:02:40.860> your<00:02:41.010> food<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.849> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
line is that chewing your food in and of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.970 
line is that chewing your food in and of
itself<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.690> addition<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> fiber<00:02:43.620> content

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
itself in addition to the fiber content

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.690 
itself in addition to the fiber content
in<00:02:44.280> bulk<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> food<00:02:44.940> seems<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.780> make<00:02:46.470> people

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
in bulk of the food seems to make people

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.970 
in bulk of the food seems to make people
experience<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.910> feeling<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.360> fullness<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.560> if

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
experience a feeling of fullness so if

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.160 
experience a feeling of fullness so if
you<00:02:50.130> tend<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> overeat<00:02:50.849> slow<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.110> one

you tend to overeat slow down it's one

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.589 
you tend to overeat slow down it's one
of<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.410> ways<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> decrease<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:53.640> food<00:02:54.120> intake

that<00:03:56.400> men<00:03:56.609> who<00:03:56.700> consumed<00:03:57.150> between<00:03:58.049> 1.3<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:58.769> 1.7

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
that men who consumed between 1.3 or 1.7

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.339 
that men who consumed between 1.3 or 1.7
servings<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.090> dairy<00:04:00.150> per<00:04:00.630> day<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.019> that's<00:04:01.200> not

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
servings of dairy per day and that's not

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.960 
servings of dairy per day and that's not
very<00:04:01.470> much<00:04:01.889> compared<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> what<00:04:02.519> many<00:04:02.790> people

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
very much compared to what many people

pretty small servings of dairy when you

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.460 
pretty small servings of dairy when you
think

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
think

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.440

and<00:04:18.800> Americans<00:04:19.250> eat<00:04:19.430> considerably<00:04:19.970> more<00:04:20.240> than

this<00:04:20.570> when<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:20.780> was<00:04:20.959> doing<00:04:21.020> some<00:04:21.410> of<00:04:21.440> the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
this when I was doing some of the

well<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.280> don't<00:04:28.580> eat<00:04:28.760> any<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.450> many<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.810> you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
well I don't eat any and many of you

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.540 
well I don't eat any and many of you
don't<00:04:30.110> eat<00:04:30.320> any<00:04:30.560> which<00:04:30.920> means<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.340> somebody

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
don't eat any which means that somebody

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.220 
don't eat any which means that somebody
out<00:04:31.730> there<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.120> probably<00:04:32.270> eating<00:04:32.600> 3,000

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
pounds of it a year so of course sperm

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.610 
pounds of it a year so of course sperm
quality<00:04:37.040> affects<00:04:37.580> fertility<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.230> one<00:04:39.590> of

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
the things that I advise parents is

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.660 
the things that I advise parents is
before<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.080> become<00:04:42.380> parents<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.220> time<00:04:43.430> to

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
before you become parents is the time to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.400 
before you become parents is the time to
start<00:04:44.030> cleaning<00:04:44.570> up<00:04:44.720> your<00:04:44.900> diet<00:04:45.110> and

practicing dietary excellence before the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.630 
practicing dietary excellence before the
time<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.660> conception<00:04:48.140> that's<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.860> best<00:04:49.160> thing

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
time of conception that's the best thing

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.610 
time of conception that's the best thing
that<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:49.910> can<00:04:50.150> do<00:04:50.330> it's<00:04:50.960> easier<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.500> get

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
that you can do it's easier to get

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.350 
that you can do it's easier to get
pregnant<00:04:51.890> for<00:04:52.250> women<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:52.640> easier<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.120> carry

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
pregnant for women it's easier to carry

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.270 
pregnant for women it's easier to carry
a<00:04:53.480> baby<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.840> term<00:04:54.140> and<00:04:54.170> avoid<00:04:54.590> complications

a baby to term and avoid complications
of<00:04:55.400> pregnancy<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:57.320> course<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.680> gives<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
of pregnancy and of course it gives the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.740 
of pregnancy and of course it gives the
opportunity<00:04:58.190> for<00:04:58.490> an<00:04:58.850> infant<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.270> start<00:04:59.540> life

out<00:05:03.470> there<00:05:03.560> is<00:05:03.800> still<00:05:04.100> taking<00:05:04.940> in<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.150> dairy

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
out there is still taking in the dairy

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.420 
out there is still taking in the dairy
products<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.960> know<00:05:06.050> some<00:05:06.380> of<00:05:06.410> you<00:05:06.620> are<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:07.310> may

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
products I know some of you are you may

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.890 
products I know some of you are you may
not<00:05:07.580> admit<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.090> me<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.450> I<00:05:08.480> know<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.690> you

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
not admit it to me but I know that you

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.930 
not admit it to me but I know that you
are<00:05:09.110> this<00:05:09.590> would<00:05:09.740> be<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> good<00:05:09.980> time<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.520> stop

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
are this would be a good time to stop

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.110 
are this would be a good time to stop
and<00:05:11.900> then<00:05:12.110> last<00:05:12.980> thing<00:05:13.130> I'll<00:05:13.430> cover<00:05:13.700> is

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
and then last thing I'll cover is

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.750 
and then last thing I'll cover is
overeating<00:05:15.020> passes<00:05:15.440> insulin<00:05:15.860> resistance<00:05:16.460> and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
overeating passes insulin resistance and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.900 
overeating passes insulin resistance and
of<00:05:17.510> course<00:05:17.750> we<00:05:18.320> all<00:05:18.470> know<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:19.040> one<00:05:19.310> mechanism

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
of course we all know that one mechanism

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.580 
of course we all know that one mechanism
for<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.090> is<00:05:20.360> overeating<00:05:20.990> causes<00:05:21.380> weight

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
for that is overeating causes weight

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.680 
for that is overeating causes weight
gain<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.130> weight<00:05:22.190> gain<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.360> leading

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
gain and weight gain is the leading

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.310 
gain and weight gain is the leading
factor<00:05:24.140> that<00:05:24.320> leads<00:05:24.500> to<00:05:24.860> type-2<00:05:25.340> diabetes<00:05:26.320> but

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
factor that leads to type-2 diabetes but

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.830 
factor that leads to type-2 diabetes but
animal<00:05:28.130> foods<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:28.670> processed<00:05:29.420> foods<00:05:29.630> are

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
animal foods and processed foods are

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.020 
animal foods and processed foods are
calorie<00:05:30.320> dense<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:31.040> high<00:05:31.190> in<00:05:31.340> fat<00:05:31.580> takes

calorie dense and high in fat takes

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.460 
calorie dense and high in fat takes
thousands<00:05:32.600> of<00:05:32.690> calories<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.230> fill<00:05:33.380> the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
thousands of calories to fill the

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.740 
thousands of calories to fill the
stomach<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.160> leads<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.610> overeating<00:05:35.210> a

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
stomach and that leads to overeating a

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.530 
stomach and that leads to overeating a

experiments on animals I just want to
report<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.440> findings<00:05:54.740> because<00:05:55.190> they<00:05:55.400> do<00:05:55.460> have

fed a very high fat diet enough fat that
it<00:06:02.270> actually<00:06:02.480> increased<00:06:03.170> their<00:06:03.380> calorie

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
it actually increased their calorie

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.220 
it actually increased their calorie
intake<00:06:03.920> by<00:06:04.370> about<00:06:04.550> 50%<00:06:04.940> over<00:06:05.780> what<00:06:05.990> the

average rat actually should eat and then
the<00:06:08.840> rats<00:06:09.020> were<00:06:09.260> evaluated<00:06:09.920> to<00:06:09.950> see<00:06:10.040> how

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
the rats were evaluated to see how

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.310 
the rats were evaluated to see how
insulin<00:06:10.910> in<00:06:11.030> the<00:06:11.060> brain<00:06:11.420> regulated<00:06:12.260> the

is<00:06:37.259> a<00:06:37.289> major<00:06:37.499> issue<00:06:37.740> in<00:06:37.979> our<00:06:38.099> country<00:06:38.550> but<00:06:39.029> also

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
is a major issue in our country but also

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.269 
is a major issue in our country but also
the<00:06:39.810> amount<00:06:40.050> of<00:06:40.110> fat<00:06:40.349> that<00:06:40.379> gets<00:06:40.740> into<00:06:41.159> the

the amount of fat that gets into the

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.670 
the amount of fat that gets into the
cells<00:06:41.520> which<00:06:41.849> makes<00:06:42.120> the<00:06:42.330> cells<00:06:42.629> more<00:06:42.990> insulin

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
cells which makes the cells more insulin

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.399 
cells which makes the cells more insulin
resistant<00:06:44.460> so<00:06:44.789> it's<00:06:45.479> no<00:06:45.659> wonder<00:06:45.689> when<00:06:46.319> you

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409 
resistant so it's no wonder when you

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.230 
resistant so it's no wonder when you
look<00:06:46.560> at<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.740> standard<00:06:47.129> American<00:06:47.580> diet<00:06:47.819> with

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
look at the standard American diet with

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.100 
look at the standard American diet with
its<00:06:48.479> calorie<00:06:48.990> dense<00:06:49.319> and<00:06:49.620> fat<00:06:50.039> density<00:06:50.840> why<00:06:51.840> we

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
its calorie dense and fat density why we

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.339 
its calorie dense and fat density why we
have<00:06:52.289> such<00:06:52.590> an<00:06:52.710> epidemic<00:06:53.039> of<00:06:53.460> type<00:06:53.520> 2<00:06:53.969> diabetes

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
have such an epidemic of type 2 diabetes

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.290 
have such an epidemic of type 2 diabetes
so<00:06:55.349> the<00:06:55.710> good<00:06:55.860> news<00:06:55.889> is<00:06:56.069> you<00:06:56.639> can<00:06:56.789> not<00:06:56.909> only<00:06:57.029> eat

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
so the good news is you can not only eat

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.580 
so the good news is you can not only eat
your<00:06:57.449> way<00:06:57.569> into<00:06:57.750> these<00:06:57.900> conditions<00:06:58.409> but
