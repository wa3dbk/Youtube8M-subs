a game store getting you know in trouble

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.949 
a game store getting you know in trouble
for<00:03:09.989> that<00:03:10.019> now<00:03:11.120> there<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.300> local<00:03:12.750> game<00:03:12.930> store

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
for that now there is a local game store

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.750 
for that now there is a local game store
near<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:13.489> but<00:03:14.489> all<00:03:15.120> i<00:03:15.180> gotta<00:03:15.540> say<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:16.140> i

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
near here but all i gotta say is i

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.539 
near here but all i gotta say is i
highly<00:03:17.760> doubt<00:03:17.970> any<00:03:18.299> local<00:03:18.840> stores<00:03:19.200> would<00:03:19.950> be

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
highly doubt any local stores would be

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.250 
highly doubt any local stores would be
getting<00:03:20.880> any<00:03:21.030> like<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.540> early<00:03:21.840> copies

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
getting any like the early copies

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.860 
getting any like the early copies
because<00:03:23.040> they<00:03:23.310> don't<00:03:23.549> they<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.390> get<00:03:24.720> their

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
because they don't they just get their

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.569 
because they don't they just get their
shipments<00:03:25.290> based<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.650> pre-orders<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.489> then

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
shipments based on pre-orders and then

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.580 
shipments based on pre-orders and then
whatever<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.120> decide<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.510> order<00:03:27.660> for<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
