beautiful this is my opinion and it
catches<00:00:16.550> quite<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.990> large<00:00:18.990> sum<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> insects

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
catches quite a large sum of insects

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.179 
catches quite a large sum of insects
it's<00:00:20.130> actually<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> far<00:00:21.689> looks<00:00:22.590> stronger<00:00:23.070> than

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
it's actually so far looks stronger than

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.150 
it's actually so far looks stronger than
dross<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> phylum<00:00:24.260> then<00:00:25.260> any<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.619> doing

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
dross a phylum then any out of doing

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300 
dross a phylum then any out of doing
plant<00:00:26.400> I've<00:00:26.609> ever<00:00:26.939> seen<00:00:27.240> such<00:00:28.109> as<00:00:28.289> wasps<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
plant I've ever seen such as wasps and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.530 
plant I've ever seen such as wasps and
they<00:00:30.060> even<00:00:30.300> hold<00:00:30.480> up<00:00:30.720> giant<00:00:31.289> needles<00:00:32.239> malas

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.290 

pictures<00:00:39.540> flies<00:00:39.809> Breda<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.430> flies

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.840 

almost<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.570> Sarah<00:00:45.899> Senya<00:00:46.579> it<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.670> very

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
almost as much as Sarah Senya it is very

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.900 
almost as much as Sarah Senya it is very
drought<00:00:48.090> tolerant<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.550> because<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.730> grows

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
drought tolerant and because it grows

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
drought tolerant and because it grows
naturally<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.600> places<00:00:52.469> where<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.739> very

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
naturally in places where it's very

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
naturally in places where it's very
sandy<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.640> enough<00:00:53.879> water<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> know

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
sandy and not enough water if you know

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
sandy and not enough water if you know
Australia's<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.379> dry<00:00:55.620> continent<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
Australia's that dry continent if you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
Australia's that dry continent if you
water<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> too<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.289> dies<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:58.980> mature

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
water it too much it dies when mature

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
water it too much it dies when mature
now<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.699> they're<00:00:59.879> small<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.660> grow<00:01:00.960> in

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
now when they're small they can grow in

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
now when they're small they can grow in
an<00:01:02.219> area<00:01:02.520> where<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.090> where<00:01:03.359> there's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
an area where there's not where there's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.230 
an area where there's not where there's
a<00:01:03.570> lot<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:03.930> almost<00:01:04.799> submerged<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.909> once

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
a lot of water almost submerged but once

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.090 
a lot of water almost submerged but once
they<00:01:06.330> get<00:01:06.450> bigger<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> tell<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
they get bigger you can tell because the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
they get bigger you can tell because the
top<00:01:08.310> tentacles<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.450> there's<00:01:09.630> too<00:01:09.810> much<00:01:09.840> water

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
top tentacles if there's too much water

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.679 
top tentacles if there's too much water
the<00:01:10.320> top<00:01:10.500> tentacles<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.250> this

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
the top tentacles kind of look like this

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.050 
the top tentacles kind of look like this
they<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.840> extended<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:14.060> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
they are not extended all the way and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
they are not extended all the way and
that<00:01:15.479> usually<00:01:16.140> means<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.860> water

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that usually means it's too much water

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
that usually means it's too much water
so<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.759> new<00:01:18.150> tentacles<00:01:18.570> started<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.170> that

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so the new tentacles started going that

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.719 
so the new tentacles started going that
means<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:20.009> two<00:01:20.130> inch<00:01:20.250> water<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> need<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
means it's two inch water you need to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
means it's two inch water you need to
cut<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> water<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.680> another

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
cut down on the water now also another

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
cut down on the water now also another
clue<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.180> sometimes<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> tentacles

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
clue is that sometimes the tentacles

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.600 
clue is that sometimes the tentacles
will<00:01:25.350> start<00:01:25.530> looking<00:01:25.650> yellow<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.490> they

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
will start looking yellow now if they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
will start looking yellow now if they
the<00:01:27.210> heads<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> tentacles<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.080> yellow

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
the heads of the tentacles with yellow

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
the heads of the tentacles with yellow
that<00:01:29.100> usually<00:01:29.700> means<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.090> there's<00:01:30.420> too<00:01:30.630> much

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that usually means that there's too much

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
that usually means that there's too much
water<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.369> an<00:01:32.490> example<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
water and this is kind of an example of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.210 
water and this is kind of an example of
a<00:01:33.030> little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.479> too<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.810> water<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.829> not

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
a little bit too much water not not

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.179 
a little bit too much water not not
fatal<00:01:35.579> yet<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> lot<00:01:37.590> like

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
fatal yet but what if there's a lot like

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
fatal yet but what if there's a lot like
the<00:01:38.610> great<00:01:38.939> sum<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> water<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.990> they're<00:01:40.140> not

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the great sum of water and they're not

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.120 
the great sum of water and they're not
happy<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.070> leaves<00:01:41.579> only<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.299> long

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
happy the leaves only be about that long

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
happy the leaves only be about that long
so<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.509> gotta<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.409> keep<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> when

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
so you just gotta kind of keep it when

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
so you just gotta kind of keep it when
you're<00:01:47.100> watering<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.880> where<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> tentacles

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you're watering so where the tentacles

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.310 
you're watering so where the tentacles
are<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.200> fully<00:01:49.470> extended<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:51.000> good

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
are all fully extended and that's good

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.300 
are all fully extended and that's good
the<00:01:52.320> maximum<00:01:52.770> size<00:01:53.070> obscene<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
the maximum size obscene is

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.749 
the maximum size obscene is
species<00:01:54.759> get<00:01:55.170> about<00:01:56.170> 11<00:01:56.320> inches<00:01:56.979> tall<00:01:57.340> from

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
species get about 11 inches tall from

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.630 
species get about 11 inches tall from
the<00:01:57.850> base<00:01:58.000> of<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.240> soil<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.710> since<00:02:00.490> this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
the base of the soil and that since this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.200 
the base of the soil and that since this
is<00:02:00.820> in<00:02:01.500> July<00:02:02.500> right<00:02:02.860> now<00:02:03.039> that<00:02:03.850> was<00:02:04.030> in

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
is in July right now that was in

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.480 
is in July right now that was in
November<00:02:04.960> after<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.799> they<00:02:05.920> had<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.100> little<00:02:06.340> bit

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
November after so they had a little bit

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.180 
November after so they had a little bit
more<00:02:06.670> time<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.000> go<00:02:07.119> they<00:02:07.299> are<00:02:07.329> annuals<00:02:08.190> when

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
more time to go they are annuals when

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.490 
more time to go they are annuals when
they<00:02:09.280> do<00:02:09.340> produce<00:02:09.610> tons<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.209> seed<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:11.200> can<00:02:11.319> see

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
they do produce tons of seed you can see

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.229 
they do produce tons of seed you can see
here<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:12.190> seed<00:02:12.400> pods<00:02:12.640> are<00:02:12.790> actually<00:02:13.060> very

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
here the seed pods are actually very

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.140 
here the seed pods are actually very
strange<00:02:13.709> they<00:02:14.709> grow<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.400> very<00:02:15.730> long

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
strange they grow in this very long

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.759 
strange they grow in this very long
format<00:02:16.720> which<00:02:16.930> makes<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.319> very<00:02:17.440> easy<00:02:17.530> to

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
format which makes it very easy to

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.589 
format which makes it very easy to
collect<00:02:18.010> seed<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.910> pod<00:02:19.150> ripens

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
collect seed because of this pod ripens

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.350 
collect seed because of this pod ripens
