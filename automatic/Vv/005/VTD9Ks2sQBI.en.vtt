00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.490
 The argument is that with the character skill, 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.650
 Let's take a look at the reactor that Max has massed up. 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.529
 I'll do it. 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.129
 Then box 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.699
 Take your pick. So drag appropriately 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.420
 After consultation 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.420
 With acacia 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.459
 As the first fashion 

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.769
 After giving preference again 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.189
 If you let me do it 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.220
 I made the sata2 method of bed. 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.340
 In the modern era, the same mobility 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.310
 With one made 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.600
 You need to move it to free tipping. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.029
 panda 

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:46.029
 'Domestic ok 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.990
 All said. On the other hand, come back to this state 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.840
 Copy 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.780
 can 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.020
 Now, let's make a choice to work again 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.010
 Ministry of Education 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.310
 Let's look at the saw 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.020
 This is a ball that is turned in a proper position. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.060
 I'll try. Bowling ball. 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 At a certain distance, 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.810
 Representing the Assistant 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.840
 Only you are directing Peter to this degree. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 Now in Zai State 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 Mating bpm to the right, 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.880
 You'll see. Click on the helpers and the submenu 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.990
 I went in, but I have a reactor menu. 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.340
 When you make your choice, 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 I can give you such an instruction 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.710
 That's the game's poor. 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.260
 Let's set up a small island early in the barbecue. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.600
 With a spot minefield collection and a preliminary connection in a drama 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 AMOREPACIFIC is one of the places where you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.360
 I'll try. 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.870
 The stimulator also has a modifier that goes with all 8 items in particular 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.570
 Unpaid As far as the collection is still selected 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 Request the US side as it is 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 Name ad 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.110
 its body collection property 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.740
 When you hit 15 feet more frequently than before, 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.109
 The crash is worse than clean 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.159
 I need to change the stimulus value one after another. 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.649
 In addition to the cy 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:21.159
 Currently reached is also consistent with mileage. 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.479
 If you just press the industrial button just like this, 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.689
 Except for the materials, 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.759
 I'll show you. 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.759
 Pajamas are objects Early music collection 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.549
 Are you in a pants-like state with me? 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.340
 Later, when a big crash sinks 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 The reason 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.719
 Concentrated rigid neck 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.389
 The object that is not deformed is the object 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.059
 He's backed the explanation. 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.709
 So let's go again. 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.609
 Other sales 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.219
 City area Beach body color Beatles music 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.319
 It's a play ball. 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.989
 Let's install this briefly. 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.719
 horizon 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.739
 To be. 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.579
 If you can relate 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.590
 It's like the fifth we made the box. 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.229
 Because of 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.709
 Merck has not changed the product value yet 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.069
 If you're ready for freedom, go back to Jacques Diouf panel 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.899
 Return to the axis and write the first utility you have 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:24.999
 I'm calling. 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:26.589
 Click 13d 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.839
 There's more than that. 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.229
 It supports many utilities. 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.169
 At the bottom of that, the competition will have 10 more entries. 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.849
 The present position 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.849
 There is a lot of Manchester United. 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.509
 Oprah writes sharply 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.509
 Let's go around down from the jai state 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.239
 There are not enough property items to do business. 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.749
 Look it up. 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.749
 In the Zaytun unit item 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.049
 I pick up the objects and I'm having problems. 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.359
 I think it's bad for weight or friction. 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.480
 He picked the Polly Republic. 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.499
 Weight 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.499
 I will give it as food. 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 Do not get the speculation value for Professor Park 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.070
 Pharmacist 10 comes out like this. 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.699
 It's a problem 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.930
 Only mandatory pillars often benefit the consciousness that went to America 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.180
 felled 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.219
 I gave the setting value. 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.939
 I was up again with a stimulant and previewed 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.939
 Animated items will lead 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.370
 From the start0% I will apply for the handprinting frame. 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.389
 Before animating the stimulus, preview the Windows Powerhouse 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.270
 I'll try. 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.330
 Now, in real time, 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.509
 The physics engine 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.180
 I did it like that in real time, but here 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.240
 as it is 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.460
 He steals second base on his wrist 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.960
 In this way 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.960
 There's a knob in the arm. 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.710
 After drinking sports again 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.289
 I also originally here is the third satisfactory simulation 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.339
 In an attitude 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.749
 I have to set it up. 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.089
 Because I think it's a strong stick 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.099
 If you do not pay a little later, please arrange it. 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.830
 Coming along and preemptive 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.830
 If I did, I will do this and I will make a mission. 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.979
 This is the case with decoupling with banners 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.949
 It's a goal. 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:41.870
 Let's see. 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.789
 Now, 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.050
 I made 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.820
 A composed god 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.270
 Have practical physics by law 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.750
 I can see that it's an animation. 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.199
 There are a lot of places to use. 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.180
 Well later in the Advanced Course 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.589
 I want to learn more. 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:00.239
 I'll do it
