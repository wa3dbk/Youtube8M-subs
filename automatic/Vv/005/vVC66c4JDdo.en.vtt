00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.240 
pitbull
well<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.829> difference

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
well I think that there is a difference

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.670 
well I think that there is a difference
with<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> pitbulls<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> last<00:01:58.229> two<00:01:58.469> years

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
with the pitbulls in the last two years

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340 
with the pitbulls in the last two years
we've<00:01:58.950> seen<00:01:59.189> 56<00:01:59.850> dog<00:02:00.119> injuries<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> were<00:02:01.020> so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we've seen 56 dog injuries that were so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.929 
we've seen 56 dog injuries that were so
severe<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> patient<00:02:02.250> had<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.579> admitted<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
severe the patient had to be admitted to

severe the patient had to be admitted to
the<00:02:03.000> hospital<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.719> doesn't<00:02:04.049> count<00:02:04.200> just

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
