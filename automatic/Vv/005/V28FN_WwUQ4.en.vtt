protector<00:01:36.310> front<00:01:37.310> screen<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.509> i<00:01:38.539> think<00:01:38.659> i<00:01:38.929> had

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
protector front screen so i think i had

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.569 
protector front screen so i think i had
a<00:01:39.109> little<00:01:39.289> bit<00:01:39.560> effect<00:01:39.890> on<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.159> way<00:01:40.310> because

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
a little bit effect on the way because

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.669 
a little bit effect on the way because
like<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.390> feel<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.840> when<00:01:41.929> i<00:01:41.990> touch<00:01:42.409> the

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
like you feel that when i touch the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.099 
like you feel that when i touch the
screen<00:01:43.149> sometimes<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.240> won't<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.509> responsive

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109
