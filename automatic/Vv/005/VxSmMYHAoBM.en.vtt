repair job I'm gonna show you what I've
done<00:00:04.350> with<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:04.759> 50<00:00:05.759> inch<00:00:06.060> plasma<00:00:06.120> I've<00:00:06.690> had

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
done with this 50 inch plasma I've had

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.179 
done with this 50 inch plasma I've had
it<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:06.990> my<00:00:07.080> spare<00:00:07.290> room<00:00:07.350> for<00:00:07.710> quite<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.160> time

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
it in my spare room for quite some time

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.680 
it in my spare room for quite some time
and<00:00:08.670> now<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:08.790> I'm<00:00:09.030> cleaning<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.510> out<00:00:09.630> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and now that I'm cleaning it out and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.629 
and now that I'm cleaning it out and
throwing<00:00:10.080> out<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> lot<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.650> old<00:00:10.830> TVs<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.429> things

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
throwing out a lot of old TVs and things

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.970 
throwing out a lot of old TVs and things
and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:12.929> worth<00:00:13.080> fixing<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.830> got

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and I think it's worth fixing and I got

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.320 
and I think it's worth fixing and I got
the<00:00:14.160> Zed<00:00:14.610> sustain<00:00:15.000> fix<00:00:15.379> replaced<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:17.240> there's<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the Zed sustain fix replaced a there's a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.550 
the Zed sustain fix replaced a there's a
680<00:00:18.750> micro<00:00:19.170> farad<00:00:20.390> 35<00:00:21.390> volt<00:00:21.660> capacitor<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.350> the

all their old TVs after work and this is
probably<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> last<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.840> them<00:00:58.789> until<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> find

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
probably the last of them until I find

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.099 
probably the last of them until I find
another<00:01:00.239> source<00:01:00.510> although<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:00.960> really

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
another source although I don't really

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.979 
another source although I don't really
have<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.440> time<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.710> plasma<00:01:02.010> repair<00:01:02.489> anymore

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
have much time for plasma repair anymore

have much time for plasma repair anymore
some<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> newer<00:01:04.320> LCDs<00:01:04.949> are<00:01:04.979> pretty<00:01:05.250> good

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
some of the newer LCDs are pretty good

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.380 
some of the newer LCDs are pretty good
though<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.090> show<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:07.189> anyway<00:01:08.390> doesn't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
though so they do show up anyway doesn't

didn't<00:01:11.460> spend<00:01:11.640> any<00:01:11.729> money<00:01:11.909> fixing<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
didn't spend any money fixing it but I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
didn't spend any money fixing it but I
do<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> try<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.040> fix<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.430> line<00:01:14.880> because

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
do want to try and fix that line because

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.359 
do want to try and fix that line because
apparently<00:01:15.479> they<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.229> caused<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.650> dirty

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
apparently they can be caused by dirty

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
thing you're just go in the bin got it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
thing you're just go in the bin got it
put<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> bin<00:01:45.920> now<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.009> gonna<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.220> a

put it in the bin now I'm gonna have a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.469 
put it in the bin now I'm gonna have a
quick<00:01:47.340> poke<00:01:47.610> around<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.420> not

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
quick poke around with this if it's not

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
quick poke around with this if it's not
fixable<00:01:49.049> well<00:01:49.710> there's<00:01:50.009> not<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.220> use<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
fixable well there's not much use for it

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
fixable well there's not much use for it
cuz<00:01:51.060> even<00:01:51.329> standing<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> other<00:01:52.259> side

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
cuz even standing back at the other side

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.560 
cuz even standing back at the other side
of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.680> shared<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.009> quite<00:01:53.280> obvious<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:56.570> mean

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of the shared it's quite obvious I mean

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.590 
of the shared it's quite obvious I mean
certain<00:01:58.140> colour<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.860> can't<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.479> as

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
certain colour you can't see it but as

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.749 
certain colour you can't see it but as
soon<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.140> start<00:02:02.130> showing<00:02:02.310> some<00:02:02.549> lighter

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
soon as you start showing some lighter

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
soon as you start showing some lighter
colors<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.420> shows<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.750> purple<00:02:04.219> right<00:02:05.219> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
colors it just shows up purple right in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.840 
colors it just shows up purple right in
the<00:02:05.430> middle

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the middle

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.670 
the middle
well<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> quite<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> middle<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.079> yeah

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
well not quite in the middle but yeah

well not quite in the middle but yeah
there<00:02:07.890> yeah<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.459> obvious<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:10.050> get

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
there yeah that's really obvious you get

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
back off it so hmm I'll try and fix it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.989 
back off it so hmm I'll try and fix it
if<00:02:24.540> not<00:02:24.719> just<00:02:24.780> Chuck<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.379> thing<00:02:25.560> out<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:26.579> is<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:26.999 
if not just Chuck the thing out it is it

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.259 
if not just Chuck the thing out it is it
is<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> big<00:02:27.389> heavy<00:02:28.219> fairly<00:02:29.219> hefty<00:02:29.459> plasma<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
is a big heavy fairly hefty plasma and

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.509 
is a big heavy fairly hefty plasma and
they're<00:02:30.840> not<00:02:30.989> really<00:02:31.260> worth<00:02:31.439> keeping<00:02:31.980> anymore

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.959 

okay<00:02:35.519> well<00:02:35.879> now<00:02:36.719> for<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> bit<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.139> poking<00:02:37.560> around

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
okay well now for a bit of poking around

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.459 
okay well now for a bit of poking around
and<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.389> actually<00:02:39.510> take<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.079> screws

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
and you can actually take these screws

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.679 
and you can actually take these screws
out<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.769> lipslide<00:02:41.639> this<00:02:41.879> out<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.450> bit

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
out and lipslide this out a little bit

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.740 
out and lipslide this out a little bit
but<00:02:42.989> all<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.879> bottom<00:02:45.180> edge<00:02:45.269> ribbons<00:02:45.629> are

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
but all the the bottom edge ribbons are

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.330 
but all the the bottom edge ribbons are
bonded<00:02:46.049> directly<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.680> board<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.219> are

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
bonded directly to that board there are

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.970 
bonded directly to that board there are
no<00:02:49.489> ribbon<00:02:50.489> connectors<00:02:50.939> in<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.299> like<00:02:51.480> those

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
no ribbon connectors in there like those

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.439 
no ribbon connectors in there like those
so<00:02:52.980> i've<00:02:53.099> reseated<00:02:53.699> these<00:02:53.879> two<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.359> to

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
so i've reseated these two just to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.270 
so i've reseated these two just to
unlock<00:02:54.750> them<00:02:54.959> pop<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.469> ribbon<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.829> slip<00:02:56.189> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280

unlock them pop the ribbon out slip it
back<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.579> again

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
back in again

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.959 
back in again
re<00:02:57.299> clamp<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.810> after<00:02:58.709> cleaning<00:02:58.980> any<00:02:59.519> dust<00:02:59.790> off

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
re clamp it after cleaning any dust off

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.809 
re clamp it after cleaning any dust off
the<00:03:00.120> surface<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.659> it<00:03:02.510> yeah<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.159> the<00:03:05.159> problems

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
the surface of it yeah so the problems

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.670 
the surface of it yeah so the problems
four<00:03:06.209> hundred<00:03:06.449> sixty<00:03:06.569> million<00:03:06.989> from<00:03:07.409> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
four hundred sixty million from this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.559 
four hundred sixty million from this
side<00:03:07.949> here<00:03:08.219> so<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.519> about<00:03:08.699> here<00:03:09.150> sort<00:03:09.419> of<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
side here so it's about here sort of in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.819 
side here so it's about here sort of in
line<00:03:09.750> with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:10.049> main<00:03:10.169> connectors<00:03:10.709> and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
line with the main connectors and

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.189 
line with the main connectors and
everything<00:03:11.359> but<00:03:12.359> if<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.659> actually<00:03:12.989> an<00:03:13.079> edged

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
everything but if it's actually an edged

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.349 
everything but if it's actually an edged
ribbon<00:03:13.409> problem<00:03:13.949> on<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.159> very<00:03:14.340> bottom<00:03:15.120> edge

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
ribbon problem on the very bottom edge

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.699 
ribbon problem on the very bottom edge
of<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.540> panel<00:03:15.840> well<00:03:16.169> there's<00:03:16.349> not<00:03:16.439> much<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> can

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
of the panel well there's not much I can

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.860 
of the panel well there's not much I can
do<00:03:16.829> about<00:03:16.859> that<00:03:18.859> yeah<00:03:20.419> unfortunately<00:03:21.419> it's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
do about that yeah unfortunately it's

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.569 
do about that yeah unfortunately it's
not<00:03:21.989> very<00:03:22.199> serviceable<00:03:22.709> like<00:03:22.979> the<00:03:23.129> older<00:03:23.400> ones

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
not very serviceable like the older ones

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.979 
not very serviceable like the older ones
where<00:03:23.819> this<00:03:24.060> used<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.329> be<00:03:24.449> a<00:03:24.479> replaceable

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
where this used to be a replaceable

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.749 
where this used to be a replaceable
board<00:03:25.379> that<00:03:25.620> would<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:25.889> snap<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:26.549> in

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:26.759 
board that would just snap in but in

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.399 
board that would just snap in but in
this<00:03:26.879> case<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.359> bonded<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.870> panel<00:03:28.229> and

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
this case it's bonded to the panel and

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.999 
this case it's bonded to the panel and
is<00:03:29.220> basically<00:03:30.229> thrown<00:03:31.229> out<00:03:31.409> with<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.620> panel

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.009 
is basically thrown out with the panel

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.729 
is basically thrown out with the panel
look<00:03:32.129> when<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.370> goes<00:03:32.519> bad<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.560> again<00:03:34.560> just

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
look when it goes bad so again just

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.659 
look when it goes bad so again just
check<00:03:34.769> everything<00:03:36.019> this<00:03:37.019> board<00:03:37.319> is<00:03:37.680> possibly

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
check everything this board is possibly

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.759 
check everything this board is possibly
known<00:03:38.939> to<00:03:39.150> go<00:03:39.239> bad<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:39.810> again<00:03:40.109> it's<00:03:40.259> you're

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
known to go bad but again it's you're

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.319 
known to go bad but again it's you're
just<00:03:40.919> firing<00:03:41.129> up<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.519> full<00:03:41.699> auto<00:03:41.819> parts

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
just firing up the full auto parts

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.059 
just firing up the full auto parts
cannon<00:03:42.659> by<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:42.840> points<00:03:43.349> by<00:03:43.560> another<00:03:43.829> one<00:03:43.979> of

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
cannon by this points by another one of

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.789 
cannon by this points by another one of
them<00:03:44.189> and<00:03:44.430> fail<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.439> what<00:03:46.439> else<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.709> you

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
them and fail and then what else do you

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.550 
them and fail and then what else do you
do<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:48.060> wouldn't<00:03:48.599> go<00:03:48.689> back<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:49.019> far<00:03:49.199> as<00:03:49.379> that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
do I wouldn't go back as far as that

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.689

conjunction with these boards but it's

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.759 
conjunction with these boards but it's
strange<00:03:58.229> different<00:03:58.560> problem<00:04:00.769> recently

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
strange different problem recently

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.699 
strange different problem recently
common<00:04:02.340> unfortunately<00:04:03.199> that<00:04:04.199> cap<00:04:04.439> in<00:04:04.590> that

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
common unfortunately that cap in that

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.039 
common unfortunately that cap in that
fuse<00:04:04.949> or<00:04:05.099> what<00:04:05.219> I<00:04:05.250> replaced<00:04:05.699> the<00:04:06.569> cap<00:04:06.750> went

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
fuse or what I replaced the cap went

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.629 
fuse or what I replaced the cap went
really<00:04:07.349> high<00:04:07.379> resistance<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.219> took<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.489> the

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
really high resistance and took out the

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.429 
really high resistance and took out the
fuse<00:04:08.909> and<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.750> penalties<00:04:10.049> weren't<00:04:10.229> really

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
fuse and the penalties weren't really

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.709 
fuse and the penalties weren't really
dark<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.370> after<00:04:11.789> replacing<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.449> and<00:04:12.599> that

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
dark so after replacing that and that

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.819 
dark so after replacing that and that
little<00:04:12.900> green<00:04:13.079> guy<00:04:13.349> down<00:04:13.620> there<00:04:15.590> job<00:04:16.590> done

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
little green guy down there job done

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.089 
little green guy down there job done
came<00:04:17.430> up<00:04:17.579> just<00:04:17.609> fine<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.389> then<00:04:19.349> I<00:04:19.469> noticed<00:04:19.949> the

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
came up just fine and then I noticed the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.379 
came up just fine and then I noticed the
little<00:04:20.639> vertical<00:04:21.029> line

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
little vertical line

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.320 
little vertical line
which<00:04:22.509> was<00:04:22.659> I<00:04:22.719> don't<00:04:22.870> rather<00:04:23.050> unfortunate

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
which was I don't rather unfortunate

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.610 
which was I don't rather unfortunate
again<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.479> side<00:04:25.659> check<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.169> alright<00:04:26.590> I

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
again this side check that alright I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.989 
again this side check that alright I
didn't<00:04:26.949> even<00:04:27.039> take<00:04:27.249> the<00:04:27.340> board<00:04:27.580> off<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:27.819> just

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:27.999 
didn't even take the board off I just

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.700 
didn't even take the board off I just
gave<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.210> bit<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.389> a<00:04:28.449> poke<00:04:28.629> around<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.560> was

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
gave a bit of a poke around and it was

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.640 
gave a bit of a poke around and it was
alright<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.479> was<00:04:31.479> getting<00:04:31.689> full<00:04:31.870> voltage<00:04:32.379> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
alright it was getting full voltage and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.879 
alright it was getting full voltage and
realized<00:04:33.460> there<00:04:33.699> was<00:04:33.849> no<00:04:34.779> the<00:04:35.409> yes<00:04:35.620> getting

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
realized there was no the yes getting

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.140 
realized there was no the yes getting
through<00:04:36.189> and<00:04:36.340> found<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.639> little<00:04:36.789> fuse

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
through and found that little fuse

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.239 
through and found that little fuse
hidden<00:04:37.659> in<00:04:37.779> there<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:39.749> good<00:04:40.749> as<00:04:40.870> gold<00:04:41.129> so<00:04:42.129> I<00:04:42.159> do

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:42.249 
hidden in there and good as gold so I do

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.159 
hidden in there and good as gold so I do
have<00:04:42.400> some<00:04:42.849> good<00:04:42.879> spare<00:04:43.300> boards<00:04:43.689> in<00:04:43.779> that<00:04:43.930> case

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
have some good spare boards in that case

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.089 
have some good spare boards in that case
I<00:04:44.409> mean<00:04:44.849> yeah

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
I mean yeah

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.860 
I mean yeah
anyway<00:04:48.099> let's<00:04:48.639> turn<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.389> back<00:04:49.509> on<00:04:49.629> and<00:04:49.689> see

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
anyway let's turn it back on and see

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.800 
anyway let's turn it back on and see
what<00:04:49.990> happens<00:04:51.090> okay<00:04:52.090> so<00:04:52.180> I've<00:04:52.389> done<00:04:52.569> some

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
what happens okay so I've done some

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.320 
what happens okay so I've done some
cable<00:04:53.680> massaging<00:04:54.279> and<00:04:54.400> board<00:04:54.669> massaging

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
cable massaging and board massaging

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.360 
cable massaging and board massaging
while<00:04:55.539> it's<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.789> they<00:04:57.789> go<00:04:58.060> it's<00:04:59.370> either

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
while it's on and they go it's either

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.439 
while it's on and they go it's either
that<00:05:00.819> or<00:05:00.879> more<00:05:01.870> likely<00:05:02.439> that<00:05:03.009> even<00:05:03.879> piecing

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
that or more likely that even piecing

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.969 
that or more likely that even piecing
shoving<00:05:05.409> a<00:05:05.469> new<00:05:05.620> piece<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:06.750> PVC<00:05:07.830> does<00:05:08.830> that

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
shoving a new piece of PVC does that

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.850 
shoving a new piece of PVC does that
yellow<00:05:09.580> tygon<00:05:10.150> fuel<00:05:10.599> hose<00:05:10.870> I<00:05:11.199> cut<00:05:11.770> a<00:05:11.800> little

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
yellow tygon fuel hose I cut a little

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.679 
yellow tygon fuel hose I cut a little
piece<00:05:12.069> of<00:05:12.400> new<00:05:12.550> stuff<00:05:12.819> off<00:05:12.969> about<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.419> long

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
piece of new stuff off about that long

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.110 
piece of new stuff off about that long
and<00:05:13.719> actually<00:05:14.110> pushed<00:05:14.379> it<00:05:14.529> and<00:05:14.650> down<00:05:15.120> where

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
and actually pushed it and down where

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.489 
and actually pushed it and down where
the<00:05:16.300> faulty<00:05:16.990> ribbon<00:05:17.289> is<00:05:17.409> and<00:05:17.620> pushing<00:05:18.219> the

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:19.499 
the faulty ribbon is and pushing the

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:21.779 
the faulty ribbon is and pushing the
flat<00:05:20.499> flex<00:05:20.770> ribbon<00:05:21.099> against<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.550> board

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
flat flex ribbon against the board

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.429 
flat flex ribbon against the board
because<00:05:22.029> it's<00:05:22.150> just<00:05:22.419> an<00:05:22.509> edge<00:05:22.659> finder<00:05:22.930> driven

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:23.439 
because it's just an edge finder driven

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.089 
because it's just an edge finder driven
it's<00:05:23.589> not<00:05:24.060> socketed<00:05:25.500> no<00:05:26.500> difference<00:05:26.860> at<00:05:27.009> all

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
it's not socketed no difference at all

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.589 
it's not socketed no difference at all
it<00:05:27.520> didn't<00:05:27.759> make<00:05:27.849> it<00:05:27.909> worse<00:05:28.150> but<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.419> didn't

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
it didn't make it worse but it didn't

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.119 
it didn't make it worse but it didn't
make<00:05:28.659> it<00:05:28.719> better<00:05:29.219> so<00:05:30.219> she's<00:05:30.729> pretty<00:05:30.909> much<00:05:31.150> done

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
make it better so she's pretty much done

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.219 
make it better so she's pretty much done
this<00:05:33.129> one<00:05:33.339> could<00:05:33.460> probably<00:05:33.610> get<00:05:33.819> the<00:05:33.939> MOT<00:05:34.229> for

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
this one could probably get the MOT for

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.869 
this one could probably get the MOT for
a<00:05:35.259> microwave<00:05:35.800> transformer<00:05:36.490> or<00:05:36.610> something

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
a microwave transformer or something

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.290 
a microwave transformer or something
even<00:05:37.060> bigger<00:05:37.240> across<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.839> panel<00:05:38.139> and<00:05:38.259> fry<00:05:38.560> it

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
even bigger across the panel and fry it

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.529 
even bigger across the panel and fry it
but<00:05:40.300> yeah<00:05:40.569> that's<00:05:40.870> how<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.139> fix<00:05:41.529> the<00:05:42.539> Zed

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
but yeah that's how you fix the Zed

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.879 
but yeah that's how you fix the Zed
sustain<00:05:44.020> that<00:05:44.349> little<00:05:44.620> cap<00:05:45.039> and<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:46.000> fuse

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
sustain that little cap and the fuse

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.649 
sustain that little cap and the fuse
that<00:05:47.889> cap<00:05:48.129> was<00:05:48.310> visibly<00:05:48.699> blown<00:05:49.060> out<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:49.360> had

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
that cap was visibly blown out and had

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.230 
that cap was visibly blown out and had
black<00:05:49.930> speed<00:05:50.289> coming<00:05:50.649> out<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.860> top<00:05:51.039> of<00:05:51.069> it<00:05:51.310> it

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
black speed coming out the top of it it

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.079 
black speed coming out the top of it it
was<00:05:52.509> very<00:05:52.750> obvious<00:05:53.460> same<00:05:54.460> with<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.669> symptoms

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
was very obvious same with the symptoms

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:56.760 
was very obvious same with the symptoms
the<00:05:55.270> dark<00:05:55.539> like<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.080> could<00:05:56.199> just<00:05:56.379> read<00:05:56.560> the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
the dark like you could just read the

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.320 
the dark like you could just read the
on-screen<00:05:56.919> display<00:05:57.279> but<00:05:57.669> it<00:05:57.729> was<00:05:57.819> extremely

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
on-screen display but it was extremely

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
every one of these tested out okay I did

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.820 
every one of these tested out okay I did
have<00:07:27.370> to<00:07:27.490> remove<00:07:27.520> a<00:07:27.880> couple<00:07:28.030> of<00:07:28.300> them<00:07:28.480> but<00:07:28.830> yeah

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
have to remove a couple of them but yeah

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.110 
have to remove a couple of them but yeah
these<00:07:30.070> boards<00:07:30.400> are<00:07:30.490> good<00:07:30.610> I'm<00:07:30.760> going<00:07:30.850> to<00:07:30.910> keep

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
these boards are good I'm going to keep

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.410 
these boards are good I'm going to keep
all<00:07:31.440> these<00:07:32.440> boards<00:07:32.680> but<00:07:33.130> the<00:07:33.220> panel<00:07:33.490> itself<00:07:33.820> is

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
all these boards but the panel itself is

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.870 
all these boards but the panel itself is
probably<00:07:34.660> end<00:07:35.080> up<00:07:35.170> in<00:07:35.290> the<00:07:35.380> junk<00:07:35.590> bin<00:07:35.770> it's<00:07:36.730> too

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 
probably end up in the junk bin it's too

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.820 
probably end up in the junk bin it's too
big<00:07:37.060> to<00:07:37.210> be<00:07:37.240> used<00:07:37.450> as<00:07:37.600> a<00:07:37.630> security<00:07:37.990> monitor<00:07:38.230> to
