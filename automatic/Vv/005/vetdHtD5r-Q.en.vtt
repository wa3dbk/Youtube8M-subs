of chemical structure from the periodic
table<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.510> elements<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.080> these<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.980> some

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
sort of crystalline structure as well

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.139 
sort of crystalline structure as well
well<00:00:35.160> minerals<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.550> important<00:00:36.000> because

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
well minerals are important because

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.720 
well minerals are important because
without<00:00:36.660> minerals<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.320> don't<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> rocks<00:00:37.950> so

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
without minerals you don't have rocks so

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
without minerals you don't have rocks so
we<00:00:38.879> consider<00:00:39.180> minerals<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> building<00:00:40.079> blocks

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
we consider minerals the building blocks

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.470 
we consider minerals the building blocks
of<00:00:40.530> rocks<00:00:40.800> rocks<00:00:41.579> sent<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.090> different

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of rocks rocks sent to have different

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
of rocks rocks sent to have different
genes<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> different<00:00:43.320> colors<00:00:43.620> throughout

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
genes and different colors throughout

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.709 
genes and different colors throughout
all<00:00:44.340> those<00:00:44.820> different<00:00:45.149> chains<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.450> colors

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
all those different chains and colors

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
all those different chains and colors
represent<00:00:46.170> individual<00:00:46.680> minerals<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.460> make

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
represent individual minerals that make

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
represent individual minerals that make
up<00:00:47.910> an<00:00:48.030> individual<00:00:48.570> Rock<00:00:48.840> they're<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
up an individual Rock they're the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.029 
up an individual Rock they're the
building<00:00:49.620> blocks<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:50.250> rocks<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> chemical

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
building blocks of rocks so the chemical

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
building blocks of rocks so the chemical
composition<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.610> important<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.149> some

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
composition is important because some

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
composition is important because some
minerals<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.980> made<00:00:56.129> up<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> single

pyrite<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.079> probably<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> best<00:01:52.380> example

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
pyrite and probably the best example

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.819 
pyrite and probably the best example
that<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> give<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.829> graphite

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that we can give you here is graphite

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.389 
that we can give you here is graphite
which<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.399> made<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.759> carbon<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.399> diamond

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
which is made up of carbon and diamond

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
which is made up of carbon and diamond
which<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> made<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.090> carbon<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.780> two

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
which is made of carbon you have two

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.959 
which is made of carbon you have two
completely<00:02:01.710> different<00:02:02.040> minerals<00:02:02.340> made<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
completely different minerals made up of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.569 
completely different minerals made up of
the<00:02:03.119> same<00:02:03.390> element<00:02:04.290> carbon<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the same element carbon it's just that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.770 
the same element carbon it's just that
the<00:02:05.700> carbon<00:02:06.090> atoms

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the carbon atoms

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.990 
the carbon atoms
a<00:02:06.810> fight<00:02:07.110> are<00:02:07.350> arranged<00:02:07.950> very<00:02:08.310> differently

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
a fight are arranged very differently

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.970 
a fight are arranged very differently
from<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.569> carbon<00:02:09.869> atoms<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.410> diamond<00:02:12.980> so

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
from the carbon atoms in a diamond so

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.650 
from the carbon atoms in a diamond so
are<00:02:14.250> certain<00:02:14.760> properties<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.330> help<00:02:15.540> us

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
are certain properties to help us

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.400 
are certain properties to help us
identify<00:02:15.810> minerals<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.340> let's<00:02:17.819> get<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.410> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
identify minerals so let's get to it so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.080 
identify minerals so let's get to it so
the<00:02:19.530> first<00:02:19.740> one's<00:02:19.920> color<00:02:20.190> color<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.819> not<00:02:21.060> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the first one's color color is not a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.300 
the first one's color color is not a
good<00:02:21.360> identifying<00:02:21.870> property<00:02:22.380> because<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
good identifying property because the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.880 
good identifying property because the
fact<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.730> changes<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.540> much<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:25.410> sample<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
fact it changes so much from sample to

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:26.540 
fact it changes so much from sample to
sample

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
sample

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.040 
sample
get<00:02:26.970> your<00:02:27.150> color<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> vary

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
get your color is going to vary

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.740 
get your color is going to vary
tremendously<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.300> sample

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
tremendously so you see that this sample

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.100 
tremendously so you see that this sample
of<00:02:30.810> quartz<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.560> call<00:02:31.770> milky<00:02:32.069> quartz

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
of quartz that's we call milky quartz

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.800 
of quartz that's we call milky quartz
this<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.500> sample<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.220> rose<00:02:35.550> quartz<00:02:35.880> so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
this is a sample of rose quartz so

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.050 
this is a sample of rose quartz so
quartz<00:02:37.170> different<00:02:37.680> color<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:38.880> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
quartz different color and this is a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.660 
quartz different color and this is a
sample<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.630> purple<00:02:40.050> quartz<00:02:40.310> still<00:02:41.310> quartz

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
sample of purple quartz still quartz

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.040 
sample of purple quartz still quartz
again<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.480> notice<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.019> three

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
again you notice you have three

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.110 
again you notice you have three
different<00:02:43.440> samples<00:02:43.980> three<00:02:44.489> different<00:02:44.820> colors

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
different samples three different colors

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.940 
different samples three different colors
so<00:02:45.570> color<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.870> not<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> good<00:02:46.440> identifying

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so color is not a good identifying

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.680 
so color is not a good identifying
property<00:02:47.430> even<00:02:47.880> though<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.450> first

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
property even though it's the first

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.250 
property even though it's the first
thing<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.050> notice<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> mineral

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
thing that you notice for with a mineral

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.960 
thing that you notice for with a mineral
the<00:02:52.260> exception<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.739> rule<00:02:52.950> here<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.700> gonna<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the exception a rule here is gonna be

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.920 
the exception a rule here is gonna be
olivine<00:02:54.450> which<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.440> always<00:02:55.680> olive<00:02:56.310> green<00:02:56.610> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
olivine which is always olive green and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.100 
olivine which is always olive green and
sulfur

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
sulfur

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.809 
sulfur
okay<00:02:58.590> which<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:58.920> always<00:02:59.250> going<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.550> nice

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
okay which is always going to be a nice

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.340 
okay which is always going to be a nice
yellow<00:03:00.120> color<00:03:00.480> those<00:03:00.780> give<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.959> two<00:03:01.140> minerals

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
yellow color those give you two minerals

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.650 
yellow color those give you two minerals
that<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.769> could<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.280> color<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.269> help

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
that you could use color to help

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.090 
that you could use color to help
identify<00:03:05.840> luster<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> way<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
identify luster is just the way that the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.250 
identify luster is just the way that the
light<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:08.459> reflected<00:03:09.000> off<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.150> surface<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
light is reflected off the surface of a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.100 
light is reflected off the surface of a
mineral<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.610> have<00:03:11.910> either<00:03:12.209> metallic<00:03:12.959> if

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
mineral so you have either metallic if

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.199 
mineral so you have either metallic if
it<00:03:13.380> looks<00:03:13.650> like<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.829> piece<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.220> metal<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:15.000> mean

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
it looks like a piece of metal it's mean

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.870 
it looks like a piece of metal it's mean
metallic<00:03:15.690> or<00:03:16.320> nonmetallic<00:03:16.790> doesn't<00:03:17.790> look

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
metallic or nonmetallic doesn't look

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670 
metallic or nonmetallic doesn't look
like<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> piece<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.299> I'll<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:19.350> give<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
like a piece of I'll just give you a

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.440 
like a piece of I'll just give you a
couple<00:03:20.040> examples<00:03:20.280> here<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.420> here's<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:22.340> mineral

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
couple examples here so here's a mineral

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.300 
couple examples here so here's a mineral
Galena<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.989> has<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> metallic<00:03:25.530> luster<00:03:25.799> looks

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
Galena that has a metallic luster looks

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.310 
Galena that has a metallic luster looks
like<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.489> piece<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.760> metal<00:03:27.000> again<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
like a piece of metal again here you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.440 
like a piece of metal again here you
have<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.769> nonmetallic<00:03:29.430> mineral<00:03:30.030> here's<00:03:30.299> some

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
have a nonmetallic mineral here's some

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.780 
have a nonmetallic mineral here's some
feldspar<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.500> does<00:03:31.769> not<00:03:31.980> look<00:03:32.280> like<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> piece

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
feldspar that does not look like a piece

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.000 
feldspar that does not look like a piece
metal<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.570> very<00:03:33.870> important<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> identify<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
metal so very important to identify the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.390 
metal so very important to identify the
difference<00:03:35.430> between<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.940> two<00:03:36.829> so<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:38.250> be

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
difference between the two so just be

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.030 
difference between the two so just be
careful<00:03:38.760> though<00:03:38.790> because<00:03:39.060> many<00:03:39.690> times

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
careful though because many times

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.979 
careful though because many times
students<00:03:41.040> will<00:03:41.329> describe<00:03:42.329> on<00:03:42.600> metallic

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
students will describe on metallic

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.930 
students will describe on metallic
luster<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.320> being<00:03:43.530> shiny<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.579> have<00:03:44.700> shiny

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
luster as being shiny you can have shiny

reference table if your mineral does not

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.110 
reference table if your mineral does not
scratch<00:05:45.180> glass<00:05:45.509> it's<00:05:45.810> less<00:05:46.289> than<00:05:46.469> 5.5<00:05:47.250> if<00:05:47.550> it

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
scratch glass it's less than 5.5 if it

scratch glass it's less than 5.5 if it
does<00:05:48.300> scratch<00:05:48.539> glass<00:05:48.870> means<00:05:49.229> I'm<00:05:49.409> mineral

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
does scratch glass means I'm mineral

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.040 
does scratch glass means I'm mineral
sample<00:05:49.860> has<00:05:49.949> a<00:05:49.979> hardness<00:05:50.370> of<00:05:50.520> greater<00:05:50.879> than

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
sample has a hardness of greater than

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.119 
sample has a hardness of greater than
5.5<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:54.360> here's<00:05:54.569> just<00:05:54.629> quick<00:05:54.990> example<00:05:55.529> there's

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
5.5 so here's just quick example there's

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.550 
5.5 so here's just quick example there's
your<00:05:56.430> glass<00:05:56.969> plate<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.569> your<00:05:57.900> mineral<00:05:58.139> sample

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
your glass plate and your mineral sample

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.019 
your glass plate and your mineral sample
and<00:05:58.740> again<00:05:59.099> you<00:05:59.370> want<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.669> see<00:05:59.789> if<00:05:59.849> it's<00:05:59.940> going

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
and again you want to see if it's going

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.730 
and again you want to see if it's going
to<00:06:00.090> actually<00:06:00.509> scratch<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.139> glass<00:06:01.259> itself

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
to actually scratch the glass itself

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.969 
to actually scratch the glass itself
here's<00:06:02.490> an<00:06:02.580> example<00:06:02.819> of<00:06:03.060> Mohs<00:06:03.360> hardness<00:06:03.810> scale

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
here's an example of Mohs hardness scale

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.800 
here's an example of Mohs hardness scale
and<00:06:04.979> again<00:06:05.190> you<00:06:05.310> can<00:06:05.490> see<00:06:05.699> the<00:06:05.879> multitude<00:06:06.479> the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
and again you can see the multitude the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.959 
and again you can see the multitude the
range<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.289> values<00:06:07.710> that<00:06:07.949> represent<00:06:08.460> Mohs

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
range of values that represent Mohs

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.100 
range of values that represent Mohs
hardness<00:06:11.389> there<00:06:12.389> are<00:06:12.539> some<00:06:12.779> special

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
hardness there are some special

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.839 
hardness there are some special
properties<00:06:13.349> that<00:06:14.039> a<00:06:14.069> mineral<00:06:14.430> is<00:06:14.520> going<00:06:14.669> to<00:06:14.729> go

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849 
properties that a mineral is going to go

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.839 
properties that a mineral is going to go
through<00:06:15.860> so<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:16.919> you<00:06:17.039> take<00:06:17.190> a<00:06:17.219> look<00:06:17.430> at<00:06:17.580> some<00:06:17.789> of

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
through so if you take a look at some of

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.700 
through so if you take a look at some of
these<00:06:17.940> some<00:06:18.569> minerals<00:06:18.900> are<00:06:19.080> fluorescent

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
these some minerals are fluorescent

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.379 
these some minerals are fluorescent
which<00:06:20.520> means<00:06:20.729> that<00:06:20.879> they<00:06:20.969> will<00:06:21.090> glow

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
which means that they will glow

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.680 
which means that they will glow
underneath<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.870> blacklight<00:06:23.180> you<00:06:24.180> can<00:06:24.389> get<00:06:24.539> some

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
underneath a blacklight you can get some

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.439 
underneath a blacklight you can get some
mineral<00:06:24.960> sample

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
mineral sample

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.749 
mineral sample
that<00:06:25.599> have<00:06:25.809> magnetism<00:06:26.469> like<00:06:27.159> this<00:06:27.340> sample<00:06:27.639> of

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
that have magnetism like this sample of

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.709 
that have magnetism like this sample of
magnetite<00:06:29.819> you<00:06:30.819> can<00:06:30.969> get<00:06:31.090> some<00:06:31.270> minerals<00:06:31.599> that

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
magnetite you can get some minerals that

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.140 
magnetite you can get some minerals that
have<00:06:31.960> double<00:06:32.289> refraction<00:06:32.499> such<00:06:33.129> as<00:06:33.340> calcite

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
have double refraction such as calcite

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.029 
have double refraction such as calcite
you<00:06:34.809> can<00:06:34.930> see<00:06:35.080> that<00:06:35.229> the<00:06:35.319> mineral<00:06:35.589> sample<00:06:35.949> is

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 
you can see that the mineral sample is

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.980 
you can see that the mineral sample is
going<00:06:36.189> to<00:06:36.249> is<00:06:36.430> going<00:06:36.939> to<00:06:36.999> be<00:06:37.089> placed<00:06:37.569> over<00:06:37.809> top

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
going to is going to be placed over top

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.929 
going to is going to be placed over top
of<00:06:38.020> that<00:06:38.199> word<00:06:38.379> you<00:06:38.589> see<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.800> double<00:06:39.189> image<00:06:39.729> of

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:39.939 
of that word you see a double image of

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:41.459 
of that word you see a double image of
that<00:06:40.150> word<00:06:40.419> school<00:06:40.930> called<00:06:41.199> double

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
that word school called double

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:46.320 
that word school called double
refraction<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:43.979> finally<00:06:44.979> calcite<00:06:45.729> which<00:06:46.150> has

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
refraction and finally calcite which has

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.019 
refraction and finally calcite which has
a<00:06:46.360> multitude<00:06:46.779> of<00:06:47.080> properties<00:06:47.860> also<00:06:48.159> reacts

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
a multitude of properties also reacts

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:50.640 
a multitude of properties also reacts
with<00:06:49.120> hydrochloric<00:06:49.509> acid<00:06:50.199> so<00:06:50.319> you<00:06:50.379> get<00:06:50.559> the

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
with hydrochloric acid so you get the

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.129 
with hydrochloric acid so you get the
bubbling<00:06:51.099> when<00:06:51.249> acid<00:06:51.639> is<00:06:51.729> put<00:06:51.969> on<00:06:52.120> now<00:06:52.839> a<00:06:52.870> lot

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
bubbling when acid is put on now a lot

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:54.600 
bubbling when acid is put on now a lot
of<00:06:53.289> these<00:06:53.379> values<00:06:53.860> and<00:06:54.099> a<00:06:54.189> lot<00:06:54.370> of<00:06:54.520> these

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:54.610 
of these values and a lot of these

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.239 
of these values and a lot of these
properties<00:06:55.180> are<00:06:55.599> going<00:06:55.749> to<00:06:55.900> be<00:06:55.990> found<00:06:56.289> at<00:06:56.620> page
