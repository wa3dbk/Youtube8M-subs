00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
LEDs are glowing

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.590 
LEDs are glowing
into<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.320> display<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.250> believe<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.480> will

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
on this camera so I had to create this

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
on this camera so I had to create this
black<00:00:26.849> box<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.960> hope<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.529> could

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
black box here but I hope you could

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a little bit below that and you see for

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
a little bit below that and you see for
example<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> process<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> what<00:01:09.180> kind<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
example on the process of what kind of a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.320 
example on the process of what kind of a
device<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> Qualcomm

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
device this one is it's a Qualcomm

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
device this one is it's a Qualcomm
Snapdragon<00:01:12.380> s4<00:01:14.090> -<00:01:15.090> Korra's<00:01:15.860> 1.5<00:01:16.860> gigahertz

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.780 
Snapdragon s4 - Korra's 1.5 gigahertz
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.450> something<00:01:18.869> -<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:20.100> heard<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
this is something - I have not heard and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
this is something - I have not heard and
seen<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.630> long<00:01:22.080> time<00:01:22.350> ago<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.220> that's

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
seen a long time ago we have now that's

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
seen a long time ago we have now that's
naturally<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.030> 800<00:01:24.630> 801<00:01:25.049> 805<00:01:25.890> 808<00:01:26.549> 8<00:01:26.880> or<00:01:27.119> 10<00:01:27.360> 810

naturally an 800 801 805 808 8 or 10 810

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.249 
naturally an 800 801 805 808 8 or 10 810
so<00:01:28.799> these<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> newer<00:01:29.970> ones<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.990> is

that<00:03:31.709> surface<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.000> device<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.650> sometimes

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
that surface but the device is sometimes

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.640 
that surface but the device is sometimes
a<00:03:34.890> little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.160> questionable<00:03:36.380> on<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.530> other

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
a little bit questionable on the other

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.920 
a little bit questionable on the other
side<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.220> here<00:03:38.910> already<00:03:39.120> seen<00:03:39.660> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
side you have here already seen that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.580 
side you have here already seen that
flap<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.590> guess<00:03:41.010> behind<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.970> course<00:03:42.420> as<00:03:42.840> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
flap I guess behind that of course as a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.050 
flap I guess behind that of course as a
SIM<00:03:43.830> card<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.340> SD<00:03:44.640> card<00:03:45.209> up<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.280> 128<00:03:47.280> gigabyte

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
SIM card and SD card up to 128 gigabyte

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.600 
SIM card and SD card up to 128 gigabyte
internal<00:03:48.360> memory<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:48.959> 16<00:03:49.680> gigabyte<00:03:50.310> and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
internal memory is 16 gigabyte and

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.090 
internal memory is 16 gigabyte and
something<00:03:51.480> other<00:03:51.800> manufacturers<00:03:52.800> really

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
something other manufacturers really

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.760 
something other manufacturers really
should<00:03:53.610> do<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.660> same<00:03:54.900> one<00:03:55.110> as<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.590> see

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
should do the same one as you can see

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.750 
should do the same one as you can see
here<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:59.010> signs<00:03:59.370> over<00:03:59.640> here

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
here you have that that signs over here

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.180 
here you have that that signs over here
this<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.300> for<00:04:00.510> a<00:04:00.540> sim<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.140> especially<00:04:01.470> how

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
this is for a sim and especially how

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.670 
this is for a sim and especially how
these<00:04:02.610> cards<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.420> be<00:04:03.570> inserted<00:04:04.050> in

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
these cards have to be inserted in

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.160 
these cards have to be inserted in
nowadays<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.459> always<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.870> problem

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
nowadays we always have that problem
