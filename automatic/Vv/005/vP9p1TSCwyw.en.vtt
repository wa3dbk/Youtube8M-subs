00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 today we are pleased to debut 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 one more picture in our program. 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.170
 forestry machinery an opportunity 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 only for manufacturers will be able to 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 show your products in action at the most 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.180
 forestry operations and to ensure that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 Do you know the most modern one? 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.990
 being released on the market 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.120
 Today we are going to meet two batteries from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.900
 a rainy day 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.890
 too much mud the conditions could not be 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.230
 best 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.180
 and we're not talking lightning and yes 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 an operating statement of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 organized forest harvest 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.350
 we are in the south of the country where 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 Pines like this are quite common 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.110
 rough areas unstable soils 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.980
 factors that hinder and the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.980
 forest mechanization 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.620
 this is the ideal solution for 1st and 2nd 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.510
 slabs in forests like this 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:22.120
 there is nothing like the revolutionary 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:24.240
 series and the joÃ£o of the couple raves and 1070 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.240
 there 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 warden 12 10 and are unsurpassed in this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.010
 operation type 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.620
 we have 27.5 degrees and slopes in 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.940
 some situations that may operate with 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.200
 these equipment up to 30 degrees 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.240
 forests such as these have not been 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.690
 conducted for the organization 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.500
 so these compact machines 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.140
 designed to operate under 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.100
 extremes are unbeatable in terms of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 efficiency, productivity and economy 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.259
 results are confirmed with the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.069
 numbers of the harvesting operation in a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.310
 excellent value for money 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.920
 a productivity in the order of 90 trees 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 per hour on the flat area we get 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.410
 reach a productivity of 140 trees 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.160
 per hour 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.840
 this gives us an operating cost 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.840
 averaging $ 6.3 per cubic meter 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.739
 according to Andrew 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.680
 this is a cost that considers wood in the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.950
 edge of the field or harvest 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.510
 processing and transport by warner 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.780
 up the road 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.940
 the configuration with tires is also the most 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.370
 suitable for the forests we existed 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.950
 we have a much greater access to fast 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.799
 and much higher productivity 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 and the differential of a harvest is made 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.850
 with the right choices 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.060
 the head also needs to be the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.060
 suitable 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.719
 this head is the 752 is a thousand head 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.530
 kilos is a head that has a 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:23.560
 very good performance a useful life 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 larger than used 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.920
 currently 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:34.659
 this means there is less maintenance 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.519
 and the project provides for greater production 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.340
 in addition to the swivel cabs with 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.139
 leveling machines of the series and are 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.609
 equipped with the most modern 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:48.280
 in technology are machines and a 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.569
 true revolution for the better 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.569
 performance in forests 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.240
 our customers are good will power 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.780
 form a different view of the crop 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.340
 and check that this is possible 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.680
 with lower operating cost is and 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.290
 who else wins with this is the customer who 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 need productivity that needs to be 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.910
 timber all the time 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.070
 or the mechanized system that we are 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.840
 seeing today that guarantees us a 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.970
 greater tranquility is mainly a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.550
 growth and fable is not a condition 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.080
 Do you have the slightest problem with rain? 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.960
 for your weak 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.050
 who saw the machines in operation was 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.850
 satisfied and the greatest difficulty in the 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.320
 Forestry these rainy day even 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.450
 this was the main purpose of 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.310
 Enjoy the typical day is from rain to 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.050
 know the procedure and this 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.370
 new technology from where it is being 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.560
 presented to us today 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.530
 the equipment that is the best 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.810
 today in the market in terms of 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.480
 but are very good qualities and effective the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.370
 work and soon beaten the cost 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.330
 benefit is because today we have 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.130
 equipment actually on the market but not 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.930
 I got the end of the pencil 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.030
 if you really see what the difference is 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.850
 really your computing equipment 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.730
 the service if it is not 100% of the work 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.800
 but very close to that 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.920
 this class and with this couple in operation 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 this result will certainly be achieved 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.120
 but you can see that whoever is giving 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.330
 good result the question of productivity 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.370
 I do not think it costs a little more 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.590
 declivity of the terrain bag was 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.500
 able to work on the need 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.970
 today our machines are really them 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.860
 surprised mainly in 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.890
 really topography conditions that 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.230
 here a situation was a bit more 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.289
 delicate but really demonstrate a 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.550
 very good behavior 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.550
 with 11 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.970
 good
