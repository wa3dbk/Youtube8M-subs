00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.879
 Hello everyone 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:16.600
 today I will introduce you to the 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:21.400
 scar with paper we would have 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.820
 given a class and just soak 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.600
 the paper to split by cons in 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:34.149
 first as if I already had it 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.079
 do you fall into the latex you the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:41.260
 simply ask you to dry your hair 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 but that's good arrival and it's done 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.719
 I 'm coming back here I 'm trying on 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.399
 latex playstation package by 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.179
 against as it's low paper there is 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.920
 always the color 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.920
 so we will buy fantasy 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.820
 here I am fine then if you see 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240
 my mouth attracted standard hdmi times 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 perhaps 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.520
 and like me still beautiful queen 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.070
 problem 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.740
 the sound of steps can so I have 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.740
 forgot so that's good then we cut 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.610
 as I had forgotten of one of the coup I 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.899
 do the voice did so no harm if 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.580
 you best move while I 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.580
 not speak or the opposite 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 I have trouble cutting because it's 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.610
 either the fact it's hard for now 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.409
 by descartes skin the paper as 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 this so as not to forget to detach 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.750
 latex that is tall 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.739
 then we take a brush in the 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.780
 soak in the dark like these fake 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:15.349
 poor and lemire because that's the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.349
 painting that walk in the water 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.200
 so we put in the yann hole 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.120
 everywhere you can put a little 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.460
 little on the skin that when moving and we have 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.020
 it happens very pretty at the beginning after we 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 can make sense so it's going to be 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.120
 super nice a super nice it will be put 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.830
 four times the blood as it is enough 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.650
 clear it's not that I like drawing 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.410
 it's little that's all the senses are like 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.370
 So here it standards and good is 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.370
 well black like that me 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.650
 after this video I intend to make a 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.720
 video with this scar there I'm going to 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.980
 keep because it will be it will be the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.360
 following specials put it there you 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:20.850
 take your way take your brush 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.000
 you're cheating in and you're putting 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.000
 well 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:39.860
 you put in all the amp you 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.990
 go a little bit over the ledges in 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.990
 where s is a little too much black so 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:52.970
 so I'm going to take the cube and I 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.600
 put it directly it does that its 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.030
 female race 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.440
 bizot more right you see not but 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:04.790
 I took the team and yellow 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:06.290
 directly from it like this you're going 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.350
 a bit that you do not know why you 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.600
 make a big pile in me so that it dries 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.720
 so I do not know if yours did that 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.050
 but me he does that and it's pato must 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.850
 not keep super long otherwise there is 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:27.950
 a good color a good like that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.440
 it's me it's okay here you say go a 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.210
 little bit with your finger you pat a 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.180
 little bit around do not put too much 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.550
 because otherwise it's ugly 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.770
 I made a video with 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.180
 scars and I would not even like 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.330
 too much and the screw stroke of 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.580
 ugly little I caught up with that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.650
 I have if I tried to deceive them with 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.540
 the foundation and that's good 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:56.660
 succeed so that's where employers m for 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.580
 four races to face it's not too bad 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.580
 woman are not very realistic 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.849
 we 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.580
 now I am super sorry for the 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:23.290
 sound problem but here I am 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.290
 tried the row that I had talked about 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:31.270
 raise redo is wasting 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:33.220
 products for nothing hoover after you 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.410
 can adjust with latex you can 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.300
 add because after the skin she 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.340
 can not be boring so we can add 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.440
 for konate a little cpo who dangle 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.990
 I adopted it 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.030
 to my left but at the end of the video 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.080
 after never add all the towers 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.220
 so for that it's more flatter and 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.400
 against what is a problem with the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:00.070
 paper is that there is a bump there no 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.080
 good I want to put a picture of late 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:10.720
 several pictures i think of god the 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:13.330
