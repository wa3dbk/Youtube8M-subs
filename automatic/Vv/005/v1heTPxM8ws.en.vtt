00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
what that meant was it was the Pope's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.020 
what that meant was it was the Pope's
ability<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.200> basically<00:00:37.530> declare<00:00:38.040> who<00:00:38.790> could

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ability to basically declare who could

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
be king or who could be Emperor we saw

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.650 
be king or who could be Emperor we saw
that<00:00:41.340> earlier<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:41.910> talked<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that earlier when we talked about the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.750 
that earlier when we talked about the
role<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.840> Charlemagne<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> his<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.670> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
role of Charlemagne and his need for the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.779 
role of Charlemagne and his need for the
Pope<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.239> sanctify<00:00:46.079> him<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.680> divinely<00:00:47.610> chosen

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Pope to sanctify him as divinely chosen

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
Pope to sanctify him as divinely chosen
by<00:00:48.360> God<00:00:49.879> we<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.059> want<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> take<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> look<00:00:51.719> at

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
by God we also want to take a look at

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
by God we also want to take a look at
religion<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> unifying<00:00:53.010> force<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:54.149> were

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
religion as a unifying force they were

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.479 
religion as a unifying force they were
shared<00:00:54.600> beliefs<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.260> teaching<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.039> bound

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
shared beliefs and teaching that bound

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
shared beliefs and teaching that bound
people<00:00:56.969> together<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.199> sometimes<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
people together and so sometimes the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.020 
people together and so sometimes the
role<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> church<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.670> portrayed<00:00:59.940> negatively

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
role the church is portrayed negatively

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
role the church is portrayed negatively
in<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> Middle<00:01:00.989> Ages<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.770> had<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> keep<00:01:02.070> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
in the Middle Ages but I had to keep in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
in the Middle Ages but I had to keep in
mind<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.090> something<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.449> people

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
mind that this was something that people

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.359 
mind that this was something that people
truly<00:01:03.989> believed<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.010> brought<00:01:05.220> them

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
truly believed in and it brought them

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
truly believed in and it brought them
closer<00:01:05.610> together<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.840> gave<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.290> sense<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
closer together it gave them a sense of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.580 
closer together it gave them a sense of
identity<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.720> stable<00:01:10.290> force

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
identity and it was also a stable force

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
identity and it was also a stable force
the<00:01:11.010> church<00:01:11.310> was<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.030> only<00:01:12.390> remaining

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the church was the only remaining

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.960 
the church was the only remaining
institution<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.250> survived<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
institution that had survived from the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
institution that had survived from the
old<00:01:15.150> ancient<00:01:15.900> Roman<00:01:16.229> Empire<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> stable

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
old ancient Roman Empire so as a stable

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
old ancient Roman Empire so as a stable
force<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> provided<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> sense<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> security

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
force it provided a sense of security

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
force it provided a sense of security
and<00:01:20.340> community<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.119> people<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.509> well<00:01:21.750> just

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
type of beliefs and values and so the
church<00:01:32.640> played<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> role<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.509> Middle

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
church played that role in the Middle

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.069 
church played that role in the Middle
Ages<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> church<00:01:36.659> structure

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079

that's interesting if you notice on the

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.030 
that's interesting if you notice on the
shelves<00:04:10.600> what<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> books<00:04:11.049> are<00:04:11.260> they<00:04:11.680> show

chains<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.510> interesting<00:04:13.750> there<00:04:14.170> would

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
chains and it's interesting there would

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.630 
chains and it's interesting there would
be<00:04:14.290> chains<00:04:14.680> here<00:04:14.950> because<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.370> chains

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
be chains here because the chains

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.670 
be chains here because the chains
illustrate<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.329> fact<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.660> they<00:04:17.229> would<00:04:17.380> copy

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
illustrate the fact that they would copy

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.770 
illustrate the fact that they would copy
text<00:04:18.310> but<00:04:18.700> they<00:04:18.850> were<00:04:18.910> not<00:04:19.150> readily<00:04:19.570> available
