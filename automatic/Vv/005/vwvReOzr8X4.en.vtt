00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
just the mxr demos or whatever but
figured<00:00:17.880> i'd<00:00:17.970> try<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> good<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.750> out

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
figured i'd try to put a good one out

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.370 
figured i'd try to put a good one out
it's<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.890> pretty<00:00:20.130> much<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.970> my<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:22.080> boost

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
it's that pretty much to my my boost

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.720 
it's that pretty much to my my boost
setting<00:00:23.060> shut<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.300> pump<00:00:25.260> off<00:00:25.580> this<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
setting shut the pump off this is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.509 
setting shut the pump off this is
basically<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.180> used<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.480> boost<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.519> lead

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
basically I used to boost the lead

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.780 
basically I used to boost the lead
channel<00:00:30.289> push<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.130> liquid

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
channel push it into you know liquid

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.330 
channel push it into you know liquid
solo<00:00:33.300> super<00:00:34.290> crunchy<00:00:34.800> chunky<00:00:35.309> mode<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:38.070> it

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
solo super crunchy chunky mode but it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.240 
solo super crunchy chunky mode but it
sounds<00:00:38.610> pretty<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.059> its<00:00:39.210> own<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
sounds pretty good on its own as just a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.229 
sounds pretty good on its own as just a
overdrive<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> gives<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
overdrive this way it kind of gives a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.420 
overdrive this way it kind of gives a
nice<00:00:42.390> pretty<00:00:43.230> bluesy<00:00:43.739> town<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:46.250> it's<00:00:47.250> pretty

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
nice pretty bluesy town like it's pretty

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
nice pretty bluesy town like it's pretty
good<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.390> play<00:00:48.600> some<00:00:48.809> bluesy<00:00:49.410> licks<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
good but just play some bluesy licks and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740 
good but just play some bluesy licks and
you<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.730> much<00:00:50.850> hair<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.239> sounds<00:00:51.660> without

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you know much hair out sounds without

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
you know much hair out sounds without
the<00:00:51.989> bumps<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the bumps which and just with you know a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
the bumps which and just with you know a
little<00:00:54.090> bit<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> gain<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
little bit of a little bit of gain and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:16.360 
little bit of a little bit of gain and
the<00:00:57.440> volume<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:58.920> up

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.450 

that's<00:01:17.370> just<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:18.590> modified<00:01:19.590> odeon<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's just the modified odeon if you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.970 
that's just the modified odeon if you
listen<00:01:20.790> I've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> purely<00:01:22.290> clean<00:01:22.590> sound

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
listen I've got a purely clean sound

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.730 
listen I've got a purely clean sound
otherwise<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> ISP<00:01:30.750> decimeters<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.530> too

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
otherwise the ISP decimeters on too

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:45.820 
otherwise the ISP decimeters on too
which<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:31.980> why<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.490> cut<00:01:32.760> off<00:01:32.910> like<00:01:33.150> that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.960 

responsive<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:47.520> hard<00:01:47.700> you're

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
responsive to like how hard you're

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.910 
responsive to like how hard you're
picking<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.660> pic<00:01:48.810> attack<00:01:49.140> sounds

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
picking and your pic attack sounds

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.730 
picking and your pic attack sounds
really<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.730> that<00:01:54.380> it's<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> nice

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
really good like that it's got a nice

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
really good like that it's got a nice
smooth<00:01:56.400> tone<00:01:56.760> to<00:01:57.090> put<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.170> bumps<00:01:58.470> which<00:01:58.680> on

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
smooth tone to put the bumps which on

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:13.230 
smooth tone to put the bumps which on
let's<00:01:59.160> hear<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.460> sounds<00:01:59.610> like<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.640 

kind<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.330> boost<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.750> lows<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> midst<00:02:15.500> I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
kind of boost the lows in the midst I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.540 
kind of boost the lows in the midst I
don't<00:02:15.770> know<00:02:15.830> how<00:02:15.920> well<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.250> gonna<00:02:16.310> come

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
don't know how well it's gonna come

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.180 
don't know how well it's gonna come
across<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> camera<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:17.890> should<00:02:18.890> probably

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
across on the camera but should probably

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:32.949 
across on the camera but should probably
come<00:02:19.310> across<00:02:19.400> pretty<00:02:19.700> well<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:32.150> anyway<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
come across pretty well but anyway that

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.180 
come across pretty well but anyway that
should<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.480> bluesy<00:02:35.480> crunchiness

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
should just you know bluesy crunchiness

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.330 
should just you know bluesy crunchiness
it<00:02:37.190> sounds<00:02:37.459> really<00:02:37.580> good<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.060> but<00:02:38.810> i

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
it sounds really good like that but i

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.300 
it sounds really good like that but i
really<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.850> boost<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.040> lead<00:02:43.040> channel

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
really like it to boost the lead channel

00:02:43.310 --> 00:03:02.540 
really like it to boost the lead channel
which<00:02:43.610> I'm<00:02:43.790> flip<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.480> right<00:02:44.750> now
