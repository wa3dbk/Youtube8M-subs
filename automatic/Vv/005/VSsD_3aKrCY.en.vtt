00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hey people welcome to episodes around 19 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 of fifa level up last week he came 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.870
 no episode because as I said I was in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.480
 I also have hospital on facebook 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 yes, that's why I could 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 logically, produce nothing now 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.590
 I am fortunately again 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.269
 back may or may have as currently 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
 home again and the stern is coming back 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.130
 as usual the first opponent of the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 Anyway, today's game had one 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 relatively serious team with man of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 the match for match shaqiri lewandowski 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.890
 in the bavaria in version of the crawl 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.420
 in fifa schweinsteiger is extremely strong 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 is a very good team in general 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.170
 Defense also very straight lame 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.309
 I really like it very much 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 someone's finger is also on for him 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.860
 lewandowski with the first ball on 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.600
 Robben the first chance of the game 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.120
 and hits just four 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 minutes to 1 0 in the mesh very 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 early residue and that is rarely a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.879
 good omen, however, we wanted 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.930
 Of course the change is still to come 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.460
 We could not do that because the opponent 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 but continue to squeeze idiot with the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.070
 next chance held then again he 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.500
 in the 13th 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 shaqiri too is very good and also 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.410
 it's 0 2 in the twelfth minute 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.850
 or 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 after twelve minutes and 40 seconds leads 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.019
 he is already with two goals is not looked 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 good but then the touri came on rÃ©my 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.189
 Shot held at almost it was then 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.350
 much vechta that the ball directly to us 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.470
 next 0 2 again accessories 2 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.220
 through suarez and now he hits 120 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.799
 also by luis suarez the 88 24 minute 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 or 25 minutes with the connection 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.369
 we went right next nice ball 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.729
 nani is fouled and it must be a medium 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.590
 give 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.119
 clear thing because he takes the ball the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.979
 opponent from ramming him all over 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.840
 awkward and undergone by shaqiri 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.189
 he just has to be more careful and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.500
 But he does not do better 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.630
 here again to see nani pulls over 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 shaqiri skin him for a clear eleven meters 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 clear thing clear chance for me if it 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.350
 runs for the time being but he is not the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.030
 this company will be no we 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.409
 have another in the squad for 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 all important tasks are in charge 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.329
 you know who is allowed to deny it 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.049
 not too good eleven meters but still 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.450
 he can do that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.100
 he runs against newer and he hits 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.960
 Although the new corner has the ball 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.579
 even touching can distract you though 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.259
 no longer decisively distracting so that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.270
 Immediately he passes because he shot 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.189
 just too good of dave was not okay 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.390
 really good but nine wrong corner 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.110
 Accordingly, this too far away 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.149
 and does not come 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.800
 2 2 compensation at least for me and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.030
 that looked good because we wanted one 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.050
 player upgrade and we have to 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 either at least a draw 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.599
 play 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.640
 or win lewandowski with the 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.290
 chance but tech jumps stops after 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.379
 the back keeps the ball second 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.599
 line very very eventful first 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.129
 half played here 40 minutes next 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.330
 chance blocked for me and then 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.890
 again before the break met with the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.950
 shot but new is in the corner holds the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.879
 ball continues 22 in the 44 minute then 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.799
 already the second half 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.019
 nice ball on robben arjen robben 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.549
 over the day the ball goes in 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.019
 stupid of me why me 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.220
 Goalkeeper gets out I understand openly 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.079
 said a lot about not afterwards 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.239
 because that was just done badly 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.700
 may I give today not rausholen so 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.319
 especially not at all and therefore 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.329
 logical consequence of the goals 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.280
 but I also came to chances nani here 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.569
 with the ball then the corner again 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.900
 it is nani that corner in the middle 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.299
 brings there is eg laurent koscielny 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.129
 balance 3 358 very weak from the opponent 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.409
 already deuter here as weak as from 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.409
 me before at 3 2 for my opponent to 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.269
 get out the gate 33 for me 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.640
 but then reality is fouled over 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.140
 next eleven meters 1 we already had the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.010
 met the relatively happy goal 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.599
 therefore it should be better here 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.069
 make or wanted to make her feel better 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.349
 use on with his next 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.200
 opportunity to strike by eleven meters 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.940
 eleven meters from the gate like that is one 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 so bains that starts again it is 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.660
 will not shoot the spielchen 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.200
 we know yes against new comes again 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.750
 the on to but what makes us 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.099
 youngster our star in the general 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.569
 this eleven-meter strike hits the ball 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.700
 not good in the yellow respectively 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.900
 wrong oranges in the area and unfortunately 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.040
 It's enough for me and my front 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.449
 bring him as I said a lot 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.530
 very bad by that or I meet 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.220
 him very very bad bad 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.239
 sex momentum if you want to say so 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.040
 want I do not mean the 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.750
 momentum that many players claim 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.949
 in the game exists but the momentum 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.560
 which states that just do not care I 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:03.690
 I have to explain that is 33 in any case 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.530
 work on william has the chance of a million 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.209
 held there is remi much to 3 in the 85 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.590
 louis krimi is completely free 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.629
 this shot of Julian da on the 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.519
 outside line meets empty goal and ins 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.410
 empty gate at least 43 again the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.720
 opponent per lewandowski but cech holds 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.459
 great in the 90 minute or the 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.840
 replay time already and that was then 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.370
 the bottom line is too much 3 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.320
 for me from a good victory 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.440
 happy victory something but in the end 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.260
 an important victory 4 to 3 that's us 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.180
 may refractive company 2 gives 8 -3 5 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.360
 how you order for a selected player 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.380
 an upgrade to 5 upgrade and for that 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.000
 We then chose our player with the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.340
 number I do not know which number has 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.469
 in any case, under bulls, that's just fine 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.000
 Well it was not really cool 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.280
 he already sat for it he is much better 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.780
 alternative something faster a little better 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.950
 in dribble much better in shot and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.780
 also better adapt 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.060
 so clearly in all relevant stats 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.590
 superior and therefore clearly 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.180
 much better player I am very 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.530
 glad we have him whom i believe 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.240
 He can really help us 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.610
 the next opponent then too 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.860
 a good team series a this time with 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.780
 tevez with balotelli members thale with 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.880
 el shaarawy with corado with the vidal 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.969
 among other things also a very general 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.229
 good team carini caceres david alaba 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.630
 is especially a towering today in 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.680
 my eyes are always very good and that 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.330
 I should also feel because 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.340
 first with the first chance has been there 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.110
 it da remy does not come to the margin 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.550
 will only continue to use blocked 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.590
 suddenly soares completely free through the 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.810
 Giant chance but still ordered 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.820
 again 20 minute further 0 0 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.529
 Raser on the right-hand side of this 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.120
 a nice flank to suarez and that 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.370
 goal beautiful header by luis suarez 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.690
 then comes vettel through against 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.520
 I do not know who that is true 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.050
 irrelevant because he meets lower edge 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.419
 Latte the ball jumps behind the line 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.580
 to have 10 on his post was 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.740
 again and the ball gossamer owner 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.320
 from the opponent of the ball but decide 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.750
 in the own gate distracts 20 in the had 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.979
 30 minutes came the next chance 3 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.409
 0 in the 34th 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.300
 through eden hazard looked very very much 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.200
 very good from 34 minutes plays 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.150
 already 30 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.580
 the only chance against this remained 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.580
 action of escher of tevez and of 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.770
 cuadrado but cech keeps everything and thus 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.510
 the second 30 or is no longer stand 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.370
 when three came to zero the hague came here 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.099
 with the shot but there still holds 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.270
 even so, the worst can prevent but 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.460
 Of course it should not be that way yet 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.409
 been in this half draw with 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.300
 the look was emi just over it unfortunately 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.490
 next big chance for me i was here 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.889
 It was unbelievable that it was unbelievable 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.250
 but then my opponent broke off with 13 0 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.360
 So it works out 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.160
 so we can fairly because again 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.020
 stupidly what the second half 53 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.070
 not in the first half thus there is 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.870
 only in the beginning an upgrade around 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.310
 a total of eight three times two 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.290
 six plus two for the abysses too 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.240
 fierce badgers and for that we become louis 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.800
 committees felt ok but not 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.330
 really good 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.010
 generally a player of the class 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.490
 but currently he never likes it that much 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.630
 in the game and for that came sergio kun agÃ¼ero 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.840
 a bit slower but a lot much 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.580
 better dribble much better in shot 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.990
 something about equally well fit only in the head 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.070
 as bad but overall nevertheless 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.360
 much better player 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.230
 especially a lot of pacing thirds on 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.210
 every case and therefore a good one 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.410
 reinforcement for our attack of 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.850
 now even more unpredictable 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.220
 faster and even stronger is with 2,000 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.540
 aguero a topteam in general like me 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.580
 meanwhile we find ourselves on one 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.290
 Good way and are now 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.790
 almost on the home stretch 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.380
 that was it from today 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.600
 School I hope you liked it 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.860
 if so then show me with a like et 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.210
 Cetera looks past my plate 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.680
 Look in the description over 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.790
 There you will find more important links 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.130
 Anyway, we'll see each other next 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.850
 again until then and then 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.850
 bye
