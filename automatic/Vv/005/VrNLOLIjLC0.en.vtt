00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
squad of the German national team when

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.250 
squad of the German national team when
they<00:05:12.020> won<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.410> World<00:05:12.710> Cup<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:13.520> unfortunately

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
they won the World Cup but unfortunately

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.040

yeah he never started a game yeah I

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.530 
yeah he never started a game yeah I
thought<00:05:18.530> maybe<00:05:19.100> when<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:20.000> center<00:05:20.330> bake

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
thought maybe when the center bake

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.270 
thought maybe when the center bake
matzah<00:05:20.780> let's<00:05:21.140> got<00:05:21.320> injured<00:05:21.710> he<00:05:21.950> would<00:05:22.100> maybe

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
matzah let's got injured he would maybe

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.250 
matzah let's got injured he would maybe
get<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.670> chance<00:05:23.030> but<00:05:23.360> this<00:05:23.570> wasn't<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.050> case

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
get a chance but this wasn't the case
