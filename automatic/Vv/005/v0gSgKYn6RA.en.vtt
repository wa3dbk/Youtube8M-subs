00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 chronic migraine in all its 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.710
 let's say so variable then in his 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 definition classification e 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.860
 especially in his therapy they were 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 at the center of a meeting that took place 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
 that milan at the neurological institute 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.690
 carlo bests one of the most important 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.830
 of Italy and recognized at the level 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.510
 international 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 let's take stock of prevention 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 of chronic migraine with the doctor 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 licia thanks to one of the teachers of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 this course the doctor how do you do in 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
 prevent this chronic migraine 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 terrible indeed from what is there 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.590
 was told by what we understood 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 migraine form a patient who has 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.570
 a form of cranial and that is evolving 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 towards an increase situation of 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.950
 frequency and therefore of chronicity can 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.380
 be treated 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.300
 both pharmacologically and not 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.160
 pharmacologically from the point of view 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
 pharmacologic we use to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.130
 today of different categories of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.780
 drugs which are and are from 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.020
 traditional beta-calcium antagonists 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.580
 blockers to newer neuromodulators 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 to the drugs we tell ourselves more new 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.780
 generation let's see two words one by 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.270
 one then more and put the label 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 blocked the beta blockers they are 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.830
 drugs that traditionally come 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.680
 used for cardiac aspects 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.250
 have highlighted that for decades now 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.800
 a potential anti migraine activity 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.570
 and have been used a lot 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.900
 full-bodied also in the categories of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.680
 younger patients also calcium 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.620
 antagonists 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.920
 on a dozen etc. are drugs that 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.590
 now they have a series on their side 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.360
 of absolutely favorable evidence and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 they act as they reduce people 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.290
 arterial no no no no no this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.600
 we were talking about the beta blockers they have 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 other other applications in the field 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.080
 cardiology internist because 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.210
 they lower the pressure but they also act 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.100
 in an anti-mechanical sense, not because 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.869
 reduce blood pressure that is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 another separate discussion have various 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.690
 action mechanisms as well as calcium 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.020
 antagonists 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.310
 we keep in mind that they are drugs that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.770
 have a number of side effects 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.470
 not insignificant increase in weight 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.320
 ie weight gain drowsiness 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.270
 so sometimes they also interfere with 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.920
 the intellectual abilities of patients e 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.050
 this is not to be overlooked 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 regarding neuromodulators 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.370
 are newer, more innovative drugs 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 to the tried and also the coppery mice that 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.060
 they have been for which there are 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.920
 especially for the all for loved ones 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.900
 also scientific evidences with gods 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.300
 some well conducted studies also from the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.900
 our institution and that they also have 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.730
 a series of therapeutic potential 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.520
 excellent but also a series of effects 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.160
 significant collateral therefore each 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.260
 patient has his drug and every does 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.510
 hoarse manco should be chosen depending on the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.640
 patient we face there 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.140
 a universal recipe that can be 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.060
 written in general 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.010
 alongside drug therapies there 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.720
 are the aids of psycho therapies 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.090
 behavioral with techniques of 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.340
 relaxation and anything else they can 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.650
 lend a hand in pain management 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.730
 here among the pharmacological therapies 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.459
 the latest addition is that of the toxin 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.810
 how botulinum works and which it can 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.320
 be his role in terms of 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.230
 prevention the other botulinum sila is in 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.680
 reality used for a long time even if it is 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.690
 study that determined with 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.440
 certainty of effectiveness because it was 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.260
 conducted in serious scientific rigor 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.000
 it was the client this studio is 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.470
 was conducted in the United States on one 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.840
 very conspicuous case history of 1,300 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.060
 patients that he definitely cut 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.850
 the bull's head giving the toxin 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.880
 botulinum a decisive role in the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.980
 Therapy of chronic migraine why 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.200
 botulinum toxin functions 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.510
 in chronic migraine and still from 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.610
 to be defined exactly is a 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.940
 there is a more sensitive mechanism 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.160
 mechanism more at the motor level e 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.010
 so there are still aspects to be 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.500
 to clarify in this sense, however, it is true that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.690
 in this study conducted in duplicate 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.830
 blind about this large population of 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.660
 patients 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.910
 the clinical result with a 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.010
 significant improvement in crises 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.780
 and one significant is also one 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.540
 significant significant decrease 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.150
 in use and analgesics has been reported 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.160
 and therefore from February this year the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.920
 botulinum toxin also in Italy 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.520
 turns out to be a therapy counted 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.680
 among the therapies for colin di trevi 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.510
 indicated for chronic migraine that yes 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.280
 alongside that which cited white a 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.710
 all the other therapies we already have 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.540
 quoted is certainly and that should be chosen a 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.919
 depending on the characteristics of 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.330
 patient we have in front of us and his 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.370
 therapeutic possibilities we say that 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.169
 it certainly remains to say a few more words about the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.990
 what behavioral therapy means 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.660
 exactly behavioral therapy are 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.090
 all those therapies that are not 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.610
 real psychotherapies but they go 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.430
 by definition to correct the flaws of 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.310
 behavior or in this case yes 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:20.520
 it deals with therapies that are associated with 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.520
 cognitive therapies that are going to 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.200
 reconsider with the patient which ones 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.080
 are the critical aspects that can 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.900
 easily induce painful attacks 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.479
 and that go to change those 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.430
 behaviors that can easily 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.900
 favor the onset of attacks 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.780
 painful tell us some behavior 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.060
 to avoid so spoke behavior from 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.160
 avoid the most banal skipping meals 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.950
 in skipping sleep at night the sleep 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.140
 but the mind at night or in any case 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.020
 positions that are not appropriate for 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.540
 example falling asleep on the other couch 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.650
 the most serious things are the confrontation 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.080
 incorrectly in the situations of 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.270
 Important work stress is one thing 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.940
 very current in front of us 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.410
 we find practically all involved 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.440
 days or family situations 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.800
 particularly stressed through a 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.140
 reset the reset that can offer us a 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.980
 cognitive treatment 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.470
 behavioral we go with the 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.130
 patient to analyze situations e 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.080
 try to understand where these situations are 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.790
 can be modified where we 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.160
 we can change because we are always 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.780
 we who have to change things not 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.780
 are the things that change for us
