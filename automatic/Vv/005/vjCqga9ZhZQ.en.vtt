coming up with Christmas things it was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.240 
coming up with Christmas things it was
going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.079> very<00:01:40.200> typical<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:40.920> Santa

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
going to be very typical to do Santa

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.319

Claus or snowmen or things of the sort

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.429 
Claus or snowmen or things of the sort
and<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> thought<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.229> our<00:01:46.290> other

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and I thought to all of our other

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.899 
and I thought to all of our other
collections<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> realized<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.759> only

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
collections and I realized that we only

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
collections and I realized that we only
have<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.119> angels<00:01:48.810> pack<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.409> it's<00:01:49.829> actually

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
have one angels pack and it's actually

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.609 
have one angels pack and it's actually
one<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> our<00:01:51.000> older<00:01:51.329> packs<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> thought

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
one of our older packs so I thought

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.929 
one of our older packs so I thought

wouldn't it be cool if we could make

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
wouldn't it be cool if we could make

going to show you how I how I draw the
design<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> through<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
design and then how I take it through to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.560 
design and then how I take it through to
the<00:02:01.890> computer<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.939> color<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.450> lay

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
the computer so that I can color and lay

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.459 
the computer so that I can color and lay
it<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:05.270> here<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> started<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> six<00:02:07.290> pack

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.559 
and I draw out the angel give her for
all<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.830> her<00:02:14.950> final<00:02:15.310> touches<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.150> try<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.390> make

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
all of her final touches I try to make

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
have to make sure that these drawings

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.490 
have to make sure that these drawings
will<00:02:22.840> translate<00:02:23.410> into<00:02:24.239> embroidery<00:02:25.500> after

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
will translate into embroidery after

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.350 
will translate into embroidery after
drawing<00:02:26.739> her<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.099> pencil<00:02:27.580> I'll<00:02:27.819> take<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.239> of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
drawing her with pencil I'll take one of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.930 
drawing her with pencil I'll take one of
my<00:02:28.480> sin<00:02:28.840> markers<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:30.130> I'll<00:02:30.280> go<00:02:30.459> through<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
my sin markers and I'll go through and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.250 
my sin markers and I'll go through and
I'll<00:02:31.000> Tracy<00:02:31.269> outline<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:34.630> why<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.840> did<00:02:35.080> was

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
I'll Tracy outline then why I did was

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
I'll Tracy outline then why I did was
once<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.590> had<00:02:35.950> created<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.489> angel<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.269> I<00:02:37.390> had

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
once I had created the angel and I had

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.100 
once I had created the angel and I had
set<00:02:37.750> everything<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.170> place<00:02:38.410> with<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.280> pencil<00:02:39.640> I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
set everything in place with a pencil I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.630 
set everything in place with a pencil I
decided<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.650> free<00:02:41.830> motion<00:02:42.010> stitching

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
decided to do the free motion stitching

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.339 
decided to do the free motion stitching
I<00:02:42.849> decided<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.599> use<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.840> pencil<00:02:44.049> because

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
I decided to use the pencil because

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.620 
I decided to use the pencil because
unlike<00:02:44.920> when<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.250> actually<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.060> with<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.330> long

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
unlike when you actually so with a long

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.440 
unlike when you actually so with a long
arm<00:02:46.810> quilter<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:48.099> so<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.030> stitch<00:02:49.299> out

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
arm quilter and you so it you stitch out

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.150 
arm quilter and you so it you stitch out
the<00:02:49.630> free<00:02:49.810> motion<00:02:49.959> stilted<00:02:50.530> stitching<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
the free motion stilted stitching and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.559 
the free motion stilted stitching and
you<00:02:51.250> only<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:51.819> chance<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.180> do<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.540> I

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
you only have one chance to do it I

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.819 
you only have one chance to do it I
thought<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:52.930> wouldn't<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.319> be<00:02:53.380> nice<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.590> I

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
thought it wouldn't it be nice if I

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.400 
thought it wouldn't it be nice if I
could<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:54.040> erase<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.970> mess<00:02:55.150> up<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:56.079> I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
could just erase it if I mess up so I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.920 
could just erase it if I mess up so I
used<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.860> pencil<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.120> what<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.390> did<00:02:58.510> was<00:02:58.690> I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
used a pencil so what I did was I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.289 
used a pencil so what I did was I
started<00:02:58.989> at<00:02:59.709> one<00:03:00.010> end<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.730> quilt<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:02.099> I

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
started at one end of the quilt and I

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.240 
started at one end of the quilt and I
just<00:03:04.299> drew<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.410> i<00:03:05.530> drew<00:03:05.739> these<00:03:05.890> little

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
just drew and i drew these little

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.000 
just drew and i drew these little
swirlies<00:03:06.849> i<00:03:07.599> drew<00:03:08.079> these<00:03:08.200> little<00:03:08.470> swirly<00:03:08.860> so

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
swirlies i drew these little swirly so

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.530 
swirlies i drew these little swirly so
that<00:03:09.160> i<00:03:09.190> can<00:03:09.280> mimic<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.849> swirlies<00:03:10.299> that<00:03:10.450> were

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that i can mimic the swirlies that were

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.509 
that i can mimic the swirlies that were
in<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.870> two<00:03:11.590> lower<00:03:11.860> corners<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.829> like<00:03:15.340> to

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
in the two lower corners and I like to

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.080 
in the two lower corners and I like to
make<00:03:15.700> it<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> my<00:03:16.269> free<00:03:16.569> motion<00:03:17.700> goes<00:03:18.700> with

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
make it so that my free motion goes with

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.110 
make it so that my free motion goes with
the<00:03:19.569> design<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.489> is<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.670> cohesive

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
the design so that it is a cohesive

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.050 
the design so that it is a cohesive
design<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:25.120> then<00:03:25.329> i<00:03:25.480> went<00:03:25.630> ahead<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:27.060> i

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
design so then i went ahead and i

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.330 
design so then i went ahead and i
finished<00:03:28.420> up<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.139> drawing<00:03:29.739> for<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.069> free

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
finished up the drawing for the free

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.120 
finished up the drawing for the free
motion<00:03:30.549> stitching<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.650> is<00:03:38.859> what<00:03:39.010> my

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
motion stitching so this is what my

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.370 
motion stitching so this is what my
final<00:03:39.489> angel<00:03:39.850> looks<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.269> now<00:03:40.840> all<00:03:41.079> i<00:03:41.109> have<00:03:41.260> to

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
in and i can color it so what I'm going

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.140 
in and i can color it so what I'm going
to<00:03:55.930> do<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:56.349> I'm<00:03:56.950> going<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.280> take<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.819> current

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
to do is I'm going to take the current

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.089 
to do is I'm going to take the current
layer<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.599> I'm<00:03:58.780> going<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.989> multiply<00:03:59.680> or<00:03:59.980> I'm

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
layer and I'm going to multiply or I'm

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.030 
layer and I'm going to multiply or I'm
going<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.459> duplicate<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.420> layer<00:04:01.739> then<00:04:02.739> when<00:04:03.010> I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
going to duplicate the layer then when I

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.110 
going to duplicate the layer then when I
do<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.910> what<00:04:04.299> i'll<00:04:04.420> do<00:04:04.569> is<00:04:04.750> i<00:04:04.900> will<00:04:04.959> adjust

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
do that what i'll do is i will adjust

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.930 
do that what i'll do is i will adjust
the<00:04:07.120> contrast<00:04:08.069> delete<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.190> layer<00:04:09.579> on<00:04:09.849> the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the contrast delete the layer on the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940 
the contrast delete the layer on the
bottom<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.450> I'll<00:04:10.690> set<00:04:11.049> this<00:04:11.260> layer<00:04:11.650> to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
bottom and I'll set this layer to

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.430 
bottom and I'll set this layer to
multiply<00:04:12.220> what<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.180> does<00:04:13.419> is<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.599> creates<00:04:13.900> a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
multiply what that does is it creates a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.400 
multiply what that does is it creates a
mask<00:04:15.250> of<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.519> top<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.000> when<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.180> I'm<00:04:17.049> going<00:04:17.320> to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
mask of the top so when I I'm going to

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.409 
mask of the top so when I I'm going to
put<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.590> layer<00:04:17.859> another<00:04:18.729> layer<00:04:19.000> underneath

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
put a layer another layer underneath

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.770 
put a layer another layer underneath
that<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:20.019> then<00:04:20.950> what<00:04:21.099> i<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.519> is<00:04:21.729> i<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.479> go

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that and then what i can do is i can go

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.220 
that and then what i can do is i can go
to<00:04:22.840> the

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
to the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.250 
to the
colors<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.090> I<00:04:25.560> can<00:04:26.560> go<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:28.260> paintbrush

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
colors and I can go to the paintbrush

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.250 
colors and I can go to the paintbrush
and<00:04:29.670> if<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.820> see<00:04:31.180> I'm<00:04:31.660> going<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.020> demonstrate

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
and if you see I'm going to demonstrate

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.850 
and if you see I'm going to demonstrate
using<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:33.720> green<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:35.050> can<00:04:35.380> paint<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:37.860> angel

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
using this green I can paint the angel

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.030 
using this green I can paint the angel
and<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.580> will<00:04:39.730> leave<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.240> black<00:04:40.540> outline<00:04:41.110> over

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
and it will leave the black outline over

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.970 
and it will leave the black outline over
the<00:04:42.220> top<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.850> what<00:04:43.000> I'm<00:04:43.090> painting<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.710> that
