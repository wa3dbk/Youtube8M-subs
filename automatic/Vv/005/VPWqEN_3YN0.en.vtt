00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:02.940
 Hello everybody 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.750
 the readers of mattoscacco.com moto today we find ourselves seeing a trap 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.369
 the opening really 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.859
 goes very unusual we say here 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:14.710
 which, however 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.710
 it is very quality they belonged 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.109
 the white opens with 4 trestles, the c4 is a woman's cuff 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.609
 connected them within the Indian dung species and when I play white 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.290
 cavallese trento 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.290
 do you think i play horse c30 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.450
 90% of the time he will play black and he said 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.760
 after b6 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.920
 white and strange games 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.310
 trying to thwart alfierenero 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.360
 which will go to v7 via laser eye 2 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.050
 povia quiero plays differently since the white intends to move 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.210
 the standard bearer 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 moving the science into a cattery leaving only its initial diagonal 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.870
 I have no more control of the bishop to wash the pawn after pushing 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.720
 Italy 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.270
 so that pedestrian c4 practically infinite so they were take advantage for 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 go immediately to attack him bishop starts the pawn in c4 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.930
 Now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.160
 the side of the find the solution here is fine for example also c2 woman 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 b3 within other solution 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510
 bishop d4 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.800
 here the best solution to prepare would be to play bishop d2 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.080
 when they enter bishop it is almost always better to be parasitic if it is at most if 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.200
 a change 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.150
 but if you talk to a horse 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 in b 22 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.140
 if they start having 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.100
 problems 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 Let's check 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.769
 street bishops attacking the tower the tower up here the only escape house 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.529
 and now beware b9 bishop 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:18.879
 move that may seem meaningless however goddess of routine and yet reality 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.139
 this move aims to get to know m4a go to capture like this 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 inevitably born 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.219
 in fact alfieri g2 was born 'fairs 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.699
 e4 the non-pokemon cycle horse actor cannot go and catch him together 4 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:38.899
 because nailed 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:44.669
 as it can free both this attack the white can through present horse h4 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.519
 black does capture the tower 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:57.009
 its tower remains underneath and so trams would go to have a lot of games 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.749
 it's convenient 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.149
 black terrier 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.829
 a game instead convenient to go 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.079
 to exchange istet after a few friezes 2 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.009
 re mare for g2 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.959
 with the capture of this 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.279
 important 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.329
 central pedestrian piero within an advantage for example after 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.409
 castling 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.290
 since to follow any kind of moves for example with you are there and anyway 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.489
 has several holes to which enter the chain then assembly of a pedestrian but 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.120
 of a very important central pedestrian
