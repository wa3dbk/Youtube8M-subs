nasal polyps it's like a corticosteroid
and<00:02:50.940> basically<00:02:51.390> did<00:02:51.690> make<00:02:51.870> them<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.830> just

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and basically did make them kind of just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.160 
and basically did make them kind of just
shrivel<00:02:53.850> up<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.420> little<00:02:54.630> bit<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:54.930> there

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
shrivel up a little bit so that there

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.360 
shrivel up a little bit so that there
are<00:02:55.200> smaller<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.130> actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
are smaller so that I could actually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.760 
are smaller so that I could actually
breathe<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.970> smell<00:02:57.270> but<00:02:58.080> then<00:02:58.470> they<00:02:58.620> came

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
breathe and smell but then they came

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.800 
breathe and smell but then they came
back<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.250> they<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.550> got<00:02:59.700> bigger<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.270> so

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
back and they just got bigger and so

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.449 
back and they just got bigger and so
I've<00:03:01.050> been<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> prednisone<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.739> four<00:03:02.160> times

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.580 
all kinds of bad stuff if you're on them
for<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> long<00:03:14.790> time<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:16.290> recommended

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
for a long time so it's not recommended

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
for a long time so it's not recommended
so<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.040> my<00:03:17.220> case<00:03:17.250> only<00:03:17.730> thing<00:03:18.030> i<00:03:18.150> could<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.450> is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
so in my case only thing i could do is

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.710 
so in my case only thing i could do is
do<00:03:18.810> surgery<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.500> they<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.980> cut<00:03:20.220> them<00:03:20.430> out

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
do surgery so they have to cut them out

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.830

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
how if I'm booster or anything like that

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.260 
how if I'm booster or anything like that
but<00:04:51.870> basically<00:04:52.050> I'm<00:04:52.770> really<00:04:53.040> scared<00:04:53.340> cuz<00:04:53.580> okay

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
but basically I'm really scared cuz okay

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.230 
but basically I'm really scared cuz okay
the<00:04:54.540> risks<00:04:55.260> are<00:04:55.410> really<00:04:56.160> small<00:04:56.580> but<00:04:56.910> there<00:04:57.090> are

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the risks are really small but there are

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.110 
the risks are really small but there are
risks<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.960> one<00:04:58.680> damaging<00:04:59.280> your<00:04:59.370> optical<00:04:59.910> nerve

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
risks of one damaging your optical nerve

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.150 
risks of one damaging your optical nerve
which<00:05:00.390> is<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.810> nerve<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.050> connects<00:05:01.980> your

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
which is the nerve that connects your

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.190 
which is the nerve that connects your
eyes<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.300> brain<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.020> could

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
eyes to the brain so you could

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.170 
eyes to the brain so you could
potentially<00:05:04.350> lose<00:05:04.980> some<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.640> your<00:05:05.910> eyes<00:05:06.000> that

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
potentially lose some of your eyes that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960 
potentially lose some of your eyes that
are<00:05:06.240> completely<00:05:06.720> go<00:05:07.080> blind<00:05:07.410> because<00:05:07.910> they<00:05:08.910> do

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
are completely go blind because they do

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.510 
are completely go blind because they do
cut<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.480> polyps<00:05:09.840> in<00:05:10.050> these<00:05:10.350> two<00:05:10.560> sinuses<00:05:11.040> here

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
cut the polyps in these two sinuses here

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.300 
cut the polyps in these two sinuses here
and<00:05:11.730> also<00:05:12.660> there's<00:05:13.110> a<00:05:13.170> risk<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.680> losing<00:05:13.980> a

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
and also there's a risk of losing a

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.810 
and also there's a risk of losing a
brain<00:05:15.050> fluid<00:05:16.050> because<00:05:16.830> they<00:05:17.070> do<00:05:17.250> go<00:05:17.430> into

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
brain fluid because they do go into

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.670 
brain fluid because they do go into
these<00:05:17.940> sinuses<00:05:18.420> in<00:05:18.540> your<00:05:18.660> forehead<00:05:18.870> as<00:05:19.230> well

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
these sinuses in your forehead as well

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.120 
these sinuses in your forehead as well
so<00:05:20.430> it's<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:21.000> lot<00:05:21.180> of<00:05:21.630> risks<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.590> I'm<00:05:22.920> really

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
so it's a lot of risks and I'm really

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.700 
so it's a lot of risks and I'm really
scared<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:24.270> have<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.170> do<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.440> because<00:05:25.560> I

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
scared but I have to do it because I

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.590 
scared but I have to do it because I
have<00:05:25.920> no<00:05:26.130> choice<00:05:26.190> honestly<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.480> it<00:05:28.200> sucks<00:05:28.560> but

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
have no choice honestly and it sucks but

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.900 
have no choice honestly and it sucks but
yeah<00:05:30.600> and<00:05:31.020> like<00:05:31.710> they<00:05:32.130> found<00:05:32.370> out<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:32.580> I<00:05:32.760> have

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
yeah and like they found out that I have

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.460 
yeah and like they found out that I have
them<00:05:33.060> all<00:05:33.240> up<00:05:33.420> in<00:05:33.510> here<00:05:33.660> because<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:33.930> did<00:05:34.170> a<00:05:34.200> CT

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
scan and I wish they would have done it

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.470 
scan and I wish they would have done it
