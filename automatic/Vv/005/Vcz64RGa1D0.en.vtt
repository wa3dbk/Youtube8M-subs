I'm<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> talk<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:28.170> what

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I'm going to talk to you about how what

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'm going to talk to you about how what
you<00:00:28.680> eat<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.539> affect<00:00:30.869> your

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you eat and what you do can affect your

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.459 
you eat and what you do can affect your
genes<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.619> more<00:00:32.369> importantly<00:00:33.079> how<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.110> can

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
genes and more importantly how you can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
genes and more importantly how you can
how<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.460> lifestyle<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.270> basically<00:00:36.450> extend

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
how your lifestyle can basically extend

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
how your lifestyle can basically extend
the<00:00:37.710> youthful<00:00:38.309> part<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.910> life<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.450> help

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the youthful part of your life and help

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100 
the youthful part of your life and help
you<00:00:40.079> age<00:00:40.829> better<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> did<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
you age better so did you know that

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
you age better so did you know that
exercise<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.070> times<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.460> week<00:00:44.640> actually

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
exercise use four times a week actually

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
exercise use four times a week actually
four<00:00:45.480> hours<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> week<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.469> increase

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
four hours a week can increase

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
four hours a week can increase
neurogenesis<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.239> growth<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> new

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
neurogenesis that is the growth of new

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.049 
neurogenesis that is the growth of new
brain<00:00:49.320> cells<00:00:49.700> actually<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> even

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
brain cells actually it can even

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.209 
brain cells actually it can even
increase<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> hippocampus<00:00:52.500> that's<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> part

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
increase the hippocampus that's the part

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.560 
increase the hippocampus that's the part
of<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.399> brain<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:53.969> involved<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
of your brain that's involved in

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.840 
of your brain that's involved in
learning<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> memory<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:56.309> know<00:00:56.430> some<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
learning and memory we know some of the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
learning and memory we know some of the
things<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.180> increase<00:00:57.600> neurogenesis<00:00:58.260> are

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
things that increase neurogenesis are

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.760 
things that increase neurogenesis are
exercised<00:00:59.039> dark<00:00:59.489> chocolate<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.149> tea

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
exercised dark chocolate and tea

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.920 
exercised dark chocolate and tea
blueberries<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.039> red<00:01:02.280> wine<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> actually

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
blueberries and red wine and actually

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
blueberries and red wine and actually
believe<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:04.890> sex<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
believe it or not people sex and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.100 
believe it or not people sex and

okay<00:01:12.500> things<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.740> suppress<00:01:14.189> neurogenesis

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
okay things that suppress neurogenesis

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.690

as<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.500> chronic<00:01:26.369> stress<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:27.600> monkeys

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
as we know chronic stress these monkeys

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.920 
as we know chronic stress these monkeys
are<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> same<00:01:28.950> age<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.090> monkey<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> left

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
are the same age the monkey on the left

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
are the same age the monkey on the left
has<00:01:31.350> had<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.890> normal<00:01:32.280> diet<00:01:32.490> its<00:01:32.790> entire<00:01:33.150> life

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
has had a normal diet its entire life

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.590 
has had a normal diet its entire life
the<00:01:34.079> monkey<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.490> 30%<00:01:36.360> less

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the monkey on the right has had 30% less

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
the monkey on the right has had 30% less
food<00:01:36.930> its<00:01:37.170> entire<00:01:37.470> life<00:01:37.829> look<00:01:38.640> how<00:01:38.820> much

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
food its entire life look how much

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
food its entire life look how much
younger<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.600> monkey<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.290> looks

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
younger the monkey on the right looks

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
younger the monkey on the right looks
and<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.909> monkey<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and think about which monkey you want to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.760 
and think about which monkey you want to
be<00:01:43.220> okay<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.390> eating<00:01:45.810> 30%<00:01:46.649> less

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
be okay we know that eating 30% less

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.300 
be okay we know that eating 30% less
food<00:01:47.070> has<00:01:47.310> changed<00:01:47.939> changes<00:01:48.509> your<00:01:48.689> gene<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
food has changed changes your gene it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.350 
food has changed changes your gene it
decreases<00:01:50.310> genes<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.909> involved<00:01:51.270> in

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
decreases genes that are involved in

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
decreases genes that are involved in
inflammation<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:52.259> decreases<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> expression

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
inflammation it decreases the expression

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
inflammation it decreases the expression
of<00:01:53.430> genes<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.820> involved<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.240> oxidative

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of genes that are involved in oxidative

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.260 
of genes that are involved in oxidative
stress<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.820> increases<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:56.969> spurts<00:01:57.149> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
stress it increases the in spurts of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
stress it increases the in spurts of
neural<00:01:57.600> trophic<00:01:58.049> factors<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.590> why<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
neural trophic factors so why is there a
