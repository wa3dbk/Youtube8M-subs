I bought some hair products I don't know

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.849 
I bought some hair products I don't know
if<00:00:24.150> you're<00:00:24.240> familiar<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.080> but

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
if you're familiar with them or not but

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.849 
if you're familiar with them or not but
they're<00:00:26.070> healthy<00:00:26.369> sexy<00:00:26.730> hair<00:00:27.680> there<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.740> go

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
they're healthy sexy hair there we go

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.279 
they're healthy sexy hair there we go
and<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.840> mostly<00:00:31.050> off

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and there I think there are mostly off

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
and there I think there are mostly off
some<00:00:31.650> blue<00:00:31.949> bottles<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> brown<00:00:32.640> caps<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
some blue bottles of brown caps so it's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
some blue bottles of brown caps so it's
there's<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.070> really<00:00:35.160> another<00:00:35.460> hair<00:00:35.790> line<00:00:36.000> up

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
there's not really another hair line up

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.709 
there's not really another hair line up
hair<00:00:36.750> line<00:00:36.960> 1/3<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
hair line 1/3 that just like that so you

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.220 
hair line 1/3 that just like that so you
can<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:40.140> assume<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:41.780> any<00:00:42.780> bottles

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
can probably assume that any bottles

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
can probably assume that any bottles
that<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> either<00:00:44.420> sexy<00:00:45.420> healthy
