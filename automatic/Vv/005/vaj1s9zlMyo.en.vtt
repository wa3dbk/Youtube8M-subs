00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
working on a sound effect a mechanical

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.450 
working on a sound effect a mechanical
ringer<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.879> TA<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.899> handset<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
ringer that the TA one handset has in it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
ringer that the TA one handset has in it
and<00:00:44.610> he<00:00:45.360> kind<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> changed<00:00:46.050> his<00:00:46.110> mind<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
and he kind of changed his mind and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.680 
and he kind of changed his mind and
decided<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.700> he'd<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.579> I

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
decided that he'd like to have that so I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
decided that he'd like to have that so I
designed<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.020> prototype<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.489> use<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> in

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
designed a prototype and we use that in

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
designed a prototype and we use that in
this<00:00:54.420> telephone<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.579> we've<00:00:56.730> got<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this telephone and I think we've got it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.619 
this telephone and I think we've got it
really<00:00:57.420> close<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.480> it's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
really close if not right on but it's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
really close if not right on but it's
about<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.050> good<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.530> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
about as good as it's going to get it's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.929 
about as good as it's going to get it's
a<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:04.260> sound<00:01:04.530> effect<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> TA<00:01:05.549> one

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a it's a sound effect that the TA one

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.510 
a it's a sound effect that the TA one
has<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.280> ahead<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
has and so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:27.219 
has and so I'm going to go ahead and
show<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:10.729> hit<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> analyzer

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.569 

let<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> ring<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.710> more<00:01:28.890> time<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
let it ring one more time and I'm going

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:46.210 
let it ring one more time and I'm going
to<00:01:29.610> turn<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:34.790> let<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> couple<00:01:36.360> times

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.250 

and<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.550> we<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.270> close<00:01:51.140> go<00:01:52.140> ahead

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
and so I think we pretty close go ahead

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.720 
and so I think we pretty close go ahead
and<00:01:52.290> answer<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.770> telephone<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:56.370> I'm<00:01:56.610> going

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
and answer the telephone and I'm going

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.810 
and answer the telephone and I'm going
to<00:01:56.760> go<00:01:56.850> ahead<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.030> dial<00:01:57.240> some<00:01:57.570> numbers<00:02:04.820> I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to go ahead and dial some numbers I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.530

going<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.150> ahead<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.450> hang<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:08.420> I'm<00:02:09.420> going

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
going to go ahead and hang up I'm going

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
going to go ahead and hang up I'm going
to<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.690> ahead<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> hit<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> redial<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.590> this

telephone you want to see modulation

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.060 
telephone you want to see modulation
there<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.750> indicator<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.530> analyzer

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
there on that indicator on the analyzer

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.290 
there on that indicator on the analyzer
that's<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.880> hundred<00:02:24.060> percent<00:02:24.300> modulation

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
that's a hundred percent modulation

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.480 
that's a hundred percent modulation

have your volume here and it says ring
up<00:04:50.710> here<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.220> then<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:51.820> course<00:04:51.850> it's<00:04:52.330> it's<00:04:52.900> off

telephone it had a an electronic sound
for<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.160> ring<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.880> could<00:05:07.090> turn<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.419> off<00:05:07.570> if

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
for a ring and you could turn it off if

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.270 
for a ring and you could turn it off if
you<00:05:07.960> wanted<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.590> then<00:05:08.710> just<00:05:08.860> go<00:05:09.040> by<00:05:09.220> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
you wanted to and then just go by the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.610 
you wanted to and then just go by the
indicator<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.600> it's<00:05:10.750> pretty<00:05:10.960> cool<00:05:11.289> because

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
indicator but it's pretty cool because

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.270 
indicator but it's pretty cool because
that's<00:05:12.310> all<00:05:12.520> illuminated<00:05:12.940> paint<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.280> at

that's all illuminated paint and at
night<00:05:15.580> it<00:05:15.910> glows<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:19.180> really<00:05:19.419> looks<00:05:19.960> pretty

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260
