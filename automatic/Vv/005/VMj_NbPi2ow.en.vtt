00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.050
 we had it two lists ago 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.179
 about the formation of cells cells could 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 and thus new ones emerged 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.139
 cells 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.240
 body cells contain a diploid 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.010
 number of chromosomes 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 each chromosome and its two wrong 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.070
 present 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.600
 you know the chromosomes in pairs 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 to rank 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 for each of these 23 pairs of money 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 is one of the chromosomes of the pair 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.870
 from your mother 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.170
 the other from your father they contain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.460
 both information about the same hereditary 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 properties 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.410
 germ cells, on the other hand, have 23 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 different chromosomes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.539
 so they no longer have para each 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.820
 chromosome contains information about others 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.510
 hereditary traits 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 gametes germ cells are hair folds 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.030
 one cell contains only one chromosome 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.100
 1 copy and fertilized egg 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 another diploid number 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.379
 just me summer come back in pairs again 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.379
 in front of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 gametes originated by meiosis in two 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 to step 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 during meiosis 1 the chromosomes go off 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.630
 each pair apart and during meiosis 2 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.340
 the chromatids of each chromosome 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 apart 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.659
 preparation takes place in the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 interphase chromosomes are like 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 you can see here not visible 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.670
 while DNA doubles each chromosome 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
 then consists of two chromatides 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.979
 as you can see here the meiosis starts 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.979
 1 in the prophase the DNA molecule 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.030
 double and the two identical dna 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.369
 strands 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.259
 the chromatids are with the centromer 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.909
 stuck 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.119
 the nuclear membrane disappears and the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.280
 DNA molecule spiral the chromosomes 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.320
 piles then move to 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.390
 the center plane of the cell 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.930
 and good protein from the polar bodies 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.729
 wires you can compare this with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.729
 what you have seen with mitosis 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:12.790
 during the metaphase 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.730
 attach some of those protein threads 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.980
 stuck to the center lakes and the protein 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.100
 threads become shorter and pull the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.700
 chromosome pairs apart during the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.970
 telophase the cores become apart 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.970
 separated 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.640
 the two new cells are haploid 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.210
 in other words, there are no more pairs in it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 but a few chromosomes of 4 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.770
 starts and meiosis 2 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.080
 the chromosomes move again 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.270
 to the center plane of the cells and there 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.790
 pull wires are formed from again 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 the polar bodies 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.420
 the chromatides become apart 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.160
 so it is not drawn this time 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.620
 chromosome, but they separate 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.380
 drawn but the chromatids that out 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.320
 be pulled together 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.540
 the grams so despi rila swear and there 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.190
 a new core membrane is formed 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 the four haploid cells can 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.720
 specialize in germ cells 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.510
 the females of the mammals 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.660
 one of the four cells an egg and bee 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.660
 the males become all four cells 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.660
 sperm cells 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.769
 we will now have the meiosis 1 and the meiosis 2 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.769
 consecutively 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.390
 starting with the prophase in which dna is 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.400
 doubled and the chromosome pairs themselves 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.560
 move 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 in the anaphase, they separate 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.980
 drawn 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.840
 and at the telophase they are split 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.850
 then starts in May 2 and be 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.500
 they pulled apart again but this 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.739
 times the chromatids and not 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.890
 pairs of chromosomes arise 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.709
 4 hair folds the cells 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.050
 sperm cells are formed in the male 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.540
 meiosis in the testes starts at 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.239
 boys only from puberty and goes 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.000
 the afterlife through it begins 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.860
 a mitosis of the sperm cell gonia 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.239
 the germ cells in the walls of the case 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.340
 pimples 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.060
 which provides a new sperm sebaceous oils 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.950
 and a primary sperm supervises the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.040
 primary sperm to see 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.370
 is still diploid from the diploid sperm 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.530
 sees originated after meiosis 1 2 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.320
 hate louis the secondary sperm torsion 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.360
 too close to the further development 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.710
 these secondary sperm to refer to 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.530
 so each contain a chromosome 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.190
 every haploid sperm delivers after 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.080
 meiosis 2 2 cum tits 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.750
 the cum tits differentiate into 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.030
 sperm with a tail 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.420
 the formation of a sperm takes a long time 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.330
 two months in women finds the formation 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.730
 of ice steep place the formation of 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.590
 female germ cells is already starting 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.470
 mid-pregnancy 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.170
 well before the birth of a girl 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.130
 caused by mitosis in the ovaries 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.490
 the ovaries and few million diploid 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.740
 omonia ova and part of the ova 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.740
 starts the meiosis 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.210
 but stops in prophase 1 they form the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.240
 diploid primary oocyte ova 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.360
 a large number of diseases are dying 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.360
 the eyes see to be surrounded by cells 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 from the ovary this follicle 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 cells form together with the oc 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.540
 a volley bowl comes from puberty 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.790
 fsh to the influence of the hormone 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.530
 meiosis further but not with all 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.990
 follicles at the same time 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:57.340
 the break in the meiosis is minimal 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.730
 12 to a maximum of 50 years or the 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.730
 menopause 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.580
 at the start of each 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.430
 menstrual cycle take 5 to 12 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.140
 follicle greatly increased in volume and resumed 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.240
 the meiosis 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.580
 usually a follicle completes meiosis 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.560
 and the rest die 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.340
 sometimes two follicles develop further 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.800
 the risk of dizygotic twins 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.790
 grabbing in her life with a woman 400 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.770
 up to 500 follicles meiosis 1 ends with 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.030
 an uneven distribution of the land 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.610
 plasma 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.580
 one would get pretty much everything this becomes 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.050
 the secondary oh looks and the other cell 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.129
 shriveled into a polar body 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.889
 that can still share 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:42.709
 but otherwise no longer plays a role such as 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.080
 you can also see here the 

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:48.019
 secondary car sees it in the meantime 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.599
 haploid is just one more 

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:52.599
 chromosome has the meiosis 2 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:59.929
 in which only the chromatids 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:03.319
 sit the secondary oh see you here 

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:05.959
 seeing starts with meiosis 2 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:09.199
 but stops in the metaphase two 

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:10.519
 at that stage the oh looks free 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.279
 the follicle 

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:15.469
 we call this ovulation at one 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.119
 fertilization completed the secondary oh so 

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:19.029
 sees meiosis 2 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:20.719
 before the nuclei of egg cell and sperm 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:22.999
 fuse 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:25.629
 this creates the egg cell and a second one 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:25.629
 polar bodies 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:30.889
 from the moment it is fertilized 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.979
 takes place and the sperm cell 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:38.379
 at the ijssel you call the egg and 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.379
 see large or fertilized egg
