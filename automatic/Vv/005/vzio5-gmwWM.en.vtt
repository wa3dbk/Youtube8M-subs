left<00:03:56.909> is<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.079> final<00:03:58.469> result<00:04:15.139> when<00:04:16.139> it

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
left is to see the final result when it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.140 
left is to see the final result when it
comes<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.560> cons<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.039> can<00:04:17.220> definitely<00:04:17.759> think<00:04:17.940> of

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
comes to cons I can definitely think of

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.879 
comes to cons I can definitely think of
you<00:04:18.359> things<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.019> developers<00:04:19.590> could

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
you things that the developers could

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.249 
you things that the developers could
have<00:04:19.979> added<00:04:20.370> or<00:04:20.820> done<00:04:21.030> differently<00:04:21.479> on<00:04:22.079> the

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
have added or done differently on the

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.110 
have added or done differently on the
other<00:04:22.380> hand<00:04:22.680> we<00:04:23.099> have<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.430> keep<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.729> mind<00:04:23.759> that

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
other hand we have to keep in mind that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.510 
other hand we have to keep in mind that
this<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.509> a<00:04:24.840> low<00:04:25.110> weight<00:04:25.349> mobile<00:04:25.770> video<00:04:26.130> editor

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
this is a low weight mobile video editor

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.310 
this is a low weight mobile video editor
so<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.090> can't<00:04:27.330> really<00:04:27.479> blame<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.050> for<00:04:28.080> not

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
so we can't really blame it for not

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.890 
so we can't really blame it for not
being<00:04:28.620> adobe<00:04:29.190> premier<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.479> will<00:04:30.690> mention

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
being adobe premier but I will mention

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.379 
being adobe premier but I will mention
two<00:04:31.259> obvious<00:04:31.860> cons<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.669> first<00:04:32.699> one<00:04:33.180> is

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
two obvious cons the first one is

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.850 
two obvious cons the first one is
something<00:04:33.539> that<00:04:33.900> you'll<00:04:34.050> probably<00:04:34.320> realize

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
something that you'll probably realize

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.150 
something that you'll probably realize
very<00:04:35.340> quickly<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.840> editor<00:04:37.259> doesn't<00:04:37.740> support

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
very quickly the editor doesn't support

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.230 
very quickly the editor doesn't support
some<00:04:38.490> usual<00:04:39.120> file<00:04:39.419> types<00:04:39.720> like<00:04:40.099> 3gpp<00:04:41.240> however

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
some usual file types like 3gpp however

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.320 
some usual file types like 3gpp however
it<00:04:42.599> can<00:04:42.870> open<00:04:43.020> mp4<00:04:43.770> files<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.759> anything<00:04:45.210> you

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it can open mp4 files so anything you

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.999 
it can open mp4 files so anything you
record<00:04:45.780> with<00:04:45.990> your<00:04:46.110> phone<00:04:46.380> camera<00:04:46.830> is

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
record with your phone camera is

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.700 
record with your phone camera is
probably<00:04:47.400> good<00:04:48.289> second<00:04:49.289> comment<00:04:49.590> I'll

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
probably good second comment I'll

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.279 
probably good second comment I'll
mention<00:04:49.979> is<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.699> timeline<00:04:51.210> because<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:52.139> its

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
mention is the timeline because of its

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.170 
mention is the timeline because of its
small<00:04:52.530> size<00:04:52.830> it's<00:04:53.250> really<00:04:53.550> hard<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:54.030> do

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
small size it's really hard to do

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.540 
small size it's really hard to do
precise<00:04:54.690> trimming<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.830> add<00:04:56.009> multiple

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
precise trimming and to add multiple

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.629 
precise trimming and to add multiple
subtitles<00:04:57.330> but<00:04:58.110> like<00:04:58.259> I<00:04:58.380> said<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:58.949> a<00:04:59.220> mobile

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
subtitles but like I said it is a mobile

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.029 
subtitles but like I said it is a mobile
application<00:05:00.000> after<00:05:00.659> all<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.199> for<00:05:01.650> quick<00:05:01.860> and

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
application after all and for quick and

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.469 
application after all and for quick and
simple<00:05:02.190> editing<00:05:02.699> on<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.090> road

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
simple editing on the road

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.680 
simple editing on the road
it<00:05:03.539> surely<00:05:03.900> does<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.560> job<00:05:04.830> if<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:06.419> are<00:05:06.449> a

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
it surely does the job if you are a

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960 
it surely does the job if you are a
speed<00:05:07.380> draw<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.310> would<00:05:08.460> like<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.820> edit

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
speed draw and you would like to edit

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.439 
speed draw and you would like to edit
your<00:05:09.180> videos<00:05:09.570> on<00:05:09.930> your<00:05:10.409> mobile<00:05:10.770> device

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
unfortunately it doesn't allow you to

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
change the playback speed for this you

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.560 
change the playback speed for this you
can<00:05:16.440> use<00:05:16.500> another<00:05:17.039> Android<00:05:17.580> application<00:05:18.300> that

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
can use another Android application that

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.770 
can use another Android application that

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
has a variety of editing tools but you

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.469 
has a variety of editing tools but you
can<00:05:21.960> only<00:05:22.139> use<00:05:22.500> one<00:05:22.889> per<00:05:23.310> video<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.909> that's

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
can only use one per video and that's

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.320 
can only use one per video and that's
the<00:05:24.780> biggest<00:05:25.020> call

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the biggest call

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.660 
the biggest call
it's<00:05:26.720> called<00:05:26.960> Android<00:05:27.560> studio<00:05:27.800> and<00:05:28.280> for<00:05:28.550> this

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
it's called Android studio and for this

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.060 
it's called Android studio and for this
time<00:05:28.910> we<00:05:29.210> just<00:05:29.360> see<00:05:29.780> how<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.290> can<00:05:30.500> use<00:05:30.680> it<00:05:30.710> to

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
time we just see how you can use it to

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.429 
time we just see how you can use it to
speed<00:05:31.340> up<00:05:31.370> your<00:05:31.820> videos

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:34.439

the free version of Android studio

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.169 
the free version of Android studio
doesn't<00:05:36.989> allow<00:05:37.439> advanced<00:05:38.129> editing<00:05:38.489> so<00:05:39.029> we're

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:39.179 
doesn't allow advanced editing so we're

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:41.059 
doesn't allow advanced editing so we're
going<00:05:39.269> to<00:05:39.330> open<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:39.839> simple<00:05:40.229> editing<00:05:40.529> option
