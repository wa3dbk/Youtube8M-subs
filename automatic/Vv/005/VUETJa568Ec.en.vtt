one<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:32.909> favorite<00:01:33.329> ones<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.630> took<00:01:33.720> me<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
one of my favorite ones it took me a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
one of my favorite ones it took me a
long<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> find<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.560> once<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.860> did<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
long time to find it but once I did I

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
long time to find it but once I did I
love<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.479> on<00:01:36.630> screen

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
love it so I'm gonna put up on screen

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.749 
love it so I'm gonna put up on screen
here<00:01:37.170> literally<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> flash

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
here literally all it is just a flash

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
here literally all it is just a flash
game<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.600> happens<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.020> dots<00:01:40.290> will

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
game and what happens is dots will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.039 
game and what happens is dots will
appear<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.979> then<00:01:41.040> expand<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.090> shrink

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
appear and then expand and then shrink

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
appear and then expand and then shrink
down<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> dot<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.399> hit<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
down to a dot and if you don't hit it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.560 
down to a dot and if you don't hit it
within<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.970> time<00:01:45.149> period<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
within that time period that is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
within that time period that is
considered<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> Miss<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> course<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:47.070> point

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
considered a Miss of course your point

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010 
considered a Miss of course your point
is<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.180> sure<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.810> hundred

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
is to make sure you have one hundred

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
is to make sure you have one hundred
percent<00:01:49.049> accuracy<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.040> want<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> miss

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
percent accuracy you don't want to miss

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
percent accuracy you don't want to miss
any<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:50.790> dots<00:01:51.030> I'll<00:01:51.210> usually<00:01:51.420> moving<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
any of these dots I'll usually moving on

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
any of these dots I'll usually moving on
your<00:01:52.049> mouse<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.200> click<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.610> game

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
your mouse and click on them as the game

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
your mouse and click on them as the game
progresses<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.810> faster<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
progresses and will get faster and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
progresses and will get faster and
faster<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> faster<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.369> since<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:56.939> expand

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
faster and faster and since they expand

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480 
faster and faster and since they expand
and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:57.899> contract<00:01:58.530> right<00:01:59.070> down<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.430> a

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and then contract right down to a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
and then contract right down to a
smaller<00:01:59.700> size<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.509> best<00:02:00.689> strategy<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:01.259> be

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
smaller size the best strategy would be

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
smaller size the best strategy would be
to<00:02:01.500> click<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.399> whether<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> biggest

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to click on them whether at the biggest

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.219 
to click on them whether at the biggest
so<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.479> lace<00:02:03.630> chance<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.049> missing

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
so you have the lace chance of missing

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.870 
so you have the lace chance of missing
which<00:02:04.710> means<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> most<00:02:05.189> likely<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
which means you most likely want to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
which means you most likely want to
queue<00:02:06.180> them<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> hit<00:02:06.930> them<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
queue them up and hit them in the in the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
queue them up and hit them in the in the
order<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.970> spawned<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.690> course

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
order that they spawned of course

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.780 
order that they spawned of course
they'll<00:02:09.989> spawn<00:02:10.259> grow<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:10.979> contract<00:02:11.430> so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
they'll spawn grow and then contract so

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.610 
they'll spawn grow and then contract so
as<00:02:12.180> they<00:02:12.330> spawned<00:02:12.720> they'll<00:02:12.989> kind<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.290> hit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
as they spawned they'll kind of hit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.229 
as they spawned they'll kind of hit
that<00:02:13.860> medium<00:02:14.220> point<00:02:14.519> where<00:02:14.670> they're<00:02:15.000> their

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
that medium point where they're their

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.600 
that medium point where they're their
biggest<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:16.260> order<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.769> not<00:02:17.250> only<00:02:17.340> does<00:02:17.549> it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
biggest in order so not only does it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.369 
biggest in order so not only does it
make<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> look<00:02:18.900> at<00:02:19.019> your<00:02:19.170> mouse

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
make you you know look at your mouse

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.140 
make you you know look at your mouse
accuracy<00:02:20.010> control<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.580> mouse<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.760> hit<00:02:21.000> them

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
accuracy control the mouse to hit them

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.000 
accuracy control the mouse to hit them
but<00:02:21.510> also<00:02:21.629> helps<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.290> look<00:02:22.799> at<00:02:22.890> your

mental clarity your focus I'll make sure
that<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.319> you're<00:02:26.069> not<00:02:26.159> putting<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.459> good

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
that you know you're not putting a good

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.800 
that you know you're not putting a good
strategy<00:02:26.819> which<00:02:27.209> makes<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.480> clicking<00:02:27.750> on

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
strategy which makes your clicking on

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.449 
strategy which makes your clicking on
them<00:02:27.870> as<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.290> spawn<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.129> order<00:02:29.370> they

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
them as they spawn in the order they

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.770 
them as they spawn in the order they
spawn<00:02:29.700> regardless<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.239> where<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.510> spawn

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
spawn regardless of where they spawn

spawn regardless of where they spawn
across<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.349> know<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.560> screen<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.040> over

have a very large mouse pad it's because

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.199 
have a very large mouse pad it's because
instead<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.290> smite<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.980> small<00:03:44.430> fine

movements<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:46.319> their<00:03:46.500> hands<00:03:46.949> they<00:03:47.280> want<00:03:47.489> to

have big long arcing movements with the
wrists<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.069> this<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.340> because<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.819> smooths

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
wrists and this is because it smooths

out<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.419> movement<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.079> means<00:03:52.349> that<00:03:52.530> you<00:03:52.620> can

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
out the movement it means that you can

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.710 
out the movement it means that you can
stop<00:03:53.069> whenever<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.430> want<00:03:53.519> generally<00:03:54.480> lower

stop whenever you want generally lower

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.659 
stop whenever you want generally lower
sensitivity<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.440> better<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.549> know<00:03:56.639> a
