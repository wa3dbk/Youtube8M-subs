00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.019
 the sacred video mighty what we the 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.990
 juler nets also called the herb 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.870
 Immortality is originally 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.230
 from China so by the million is from the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.779
 natives were cultivated and would 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.980
 just spread through it once 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.429
 come on that is that 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.050
 is hypotensive and that the 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.829
 head of the region there originally 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:34.120
 It was getting very old as well 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.199
 Guarantee mortality to cultivate 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.460
 from these plants 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.199
 It is a shorter pumpkin family 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.410
 is in the earnings round about winter 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.640
 That's in winter you can 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.550
 propagate cuttings 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.649
 that does not mean the shoots 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.989
 supports into the water or a real one 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.989
 honor and it is very easy and can 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:08.980
 still plant the sea or you 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:11.080
 still the root part of one means one 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.500
 could so now just the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.570
 class and tear and then would indeed 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 what about ten liters bucket 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.630
 put or you set immediately into the free 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:29.170
 and they book quite strong and you can 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:31.900
 quite the leaves you can either 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.330
 to enjoy fresh that means you need 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.680
 a dare of the leaves is down 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.970
 dirty 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.480
 so far you have a bit black 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.520
 not really good but you can 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.960
 you risk it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 otherwise you can dry it that is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.330
 in the duty the leaves and botnets 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.760
 So, and then it can be used as the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.700
 plants use a whole winter 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.300
 or does the voices do that? 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.070
 are the possible uses 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.920
 the plants would otherwise be in the summer 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.970
 represent 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 thanks to her doing what she has done so far 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.550
 can grow up knows the program 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.830
 plant or washtec boxes of power 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.170
 has used as groundcover one 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.170
 striking areas to be very strong
