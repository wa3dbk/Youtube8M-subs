and<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.020> thinking<00:01:49.380> maybe<00:01:50.060> they're<00:01:51.060> going

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
and I was thinking maybe they're going

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.359 
and I was thinking maybe they're going
to<00:01:51.450> attack<00:01:51.540> from<00:01:52.110> inside<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> dimension<00:01:53.340> into

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
to attack from inside the dimension into

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
to attack from inside the dimension into
naruto<00:01:56.369> dimension<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.240> naruto<00:01:57.630> real

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
naruto dimension like the naruto real

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.249 
naruto dimension like the naruto real
world<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.640> maybe<00:02:00.600> i'm<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:00.840> sure<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.110> gonna

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
world so maybe i'm not sure that's gonna

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.230 
world so maybe i'm not sure that's gonna
work<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.649> because<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.520> only<00:02:02.610> way<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
work out because the only way out of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.820 
work out because the only way out of
that<00:02:03.299> dimension<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
that dimension is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that dimension is
if<00:02:05.510> only<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:08.100> only<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.460> I<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> think

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
if only is the only way I do you think

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.580 
if only is the only way I do you think
the<00:02:08.910> only<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.210> is<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:09.990> only<00:02:10.350> way

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the only way is as of now the only way

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.520 
the only way is as of now the only way
that<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> us<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:12.690> through<00:02:12.720> obito

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that we know of us go through obito

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
that we know of us go through obito
obito<00:02:14.070> actually<00:02:14.310> brings<00:02:14.550> them<00:02:14.700> back<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
obito actually brings them back out and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.260 
obito actually brings them back out and
maybe<00:02:16.230> obito<00:02:16.890> bring<00:02:17.250> Akashi<00:02:17.580> back<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
maybe obito bring Akashi back in and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.510 
maybe obito bring Akashi back in and
crash<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:18.960> open<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.530> doorway<00:02:19.890> back<00:02:20.280> out

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
crash you can open a doorway back out

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.060 
crash you can open a doorway back out
who<00:02:20.700> knows<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.120> don't<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.780> nah<00:02:22.140> she<00:02:22.530> will<00:02:22.800> jump

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
who knows I don't know nah she will jump

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.200 
who knows I don't know nah she will jump
inside<00:02:23.310> his<00:02:23.490> eye<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.060> suck

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
inside his eye and just like suck

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.870 
inside his eye and just like suck
himself<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:24.750> i<00:02:25.250> would<00:02:26.250> i<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.400> guess<00:02:26.670> like

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
himself up i would i would guess like

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.940 
himself up i would i would guess like
focaccia<00:02:27.270> people<00:02:27.660> do<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.110> too<00:02:28.230> sure<00:02:28.410> why

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
focaccia people do that not too sure why

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220 
focaccia people do that not too sure why
he<00:02:29.070> doesn't<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.550> guess<00:02:30.210> like<00:02:30.480> Kashi<00:02:30.690> may

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
he doesn't do it I guess like Kashi may

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.850 
he doesn't do it I guess like Kashi may
be<00:02:31.290> sure<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:32.720> its<00:02:33.720> possibilities<00:02:34.290> possibly

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
be sure but its possibilities possibly

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
be sure but its possibilities possibly
maybe<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.400> talking<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.300> his<00:02:36.390> eye<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.690> that's

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
maybe just talking to his eye and that's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.380 
maybe just talking to his eye and that's
basically<00:02:37.020> what<00:02:37.260> will<00:02:37.350> be<00:02:37.410> towed<00:02:37.560> us<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.790> who

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
basically what will be towed us but who

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.180 
basically what will be towed us but who
knows<00:02:39.480> i<00:02:39.690> do<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:40.020> they're<00:02:40.230> best<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.010> other

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
knows i do think they're best the other

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.050 
knows i do think they're best the other
dimension<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.940> take<00:02:42.030> place

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
dimension is going to take place

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.480 
dimension is going to take place
sometime<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.720> near<00:02:42.870> future<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.040> think

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
sometime the near future and I do think

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.740 
sometime the near future and I do think
not<00:02:44.880> too<00:02:44.970> sure<00:02:45.120> what's<00:02:45.270> going<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.600> with

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
not too sure what's going on with

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.630 
not too sure what's going on with
crowning<00:02:46.110> them<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
crowning them because I do know that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.480 
crowning them because I do know that
krama<00:02:48.060> does<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.920> plan<00:02:50.130> will<00:02:50.459> be

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
krama does know that the plan will be

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.310 
krama does know that the plan will be
launched<00:02:50.970> anytime<00:02:51.330> soon<00:02:51.570> i<00:02:51.720> did<00:02:51.870> i<00:02:51.900> do<00:02:52.080> think

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
launched anytime soon i did i do think

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.380 
launched anytime soon i did i do think
he<00:02:52.500> acknowledges<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.550> what<00:02:54.300> they're

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
he acknowledges that and what they're

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.790 
he acknowledges that and what they're
having<00:02:54.450> been<00:02:54.720> said<00:02:54.959> he<00:02:55.110> did<00:02:55.260> say<00:02:55.440> he's<00:02:55.560> going

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
having been said he did say he's going

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.580 
having been said he did say he's going
to<00:02:55.920> heal<00:02:56.130> he<00:02:56.880> did<00:02:57.390> say<00:02:57.540> he's<00:02:57.660> gonna<00:02:57.780> kill<00:02:58.080> guy

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
to heal he did say he's gonna kill guy

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.080 
to heal he did say he's gonna kill guy
the<00:02:58.950> guy<00:02:59.070> guys<00:02:59.310> actually<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.850> was<00:02:59.970> pretty

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the guy guys actually that was pretty

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.510 
the guy guys actually that was pretty
funny<00:03:00.300> last<00:03:00.540> chapter<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:00.990> not<00:03:01.800> too<00:03:01.920> sure<00:03:02.100> when

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
funny last chapter and not too sure when

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.850 
funny last chapter and not too sure when
but<00:03:03.150> anything<00:03:03.600> he's<00:03:03.720> gonna<00:03:03.870> kind<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.620> healing

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
but anything he's gonna kind of healing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.880 
but anything he's gonna kind of healing
because<00:03:05.700> think<00:03:06.180> about<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.720> mean<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.740> eight

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
because think about it I mean the eight

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.509 
because think about it I mean the eight
gates<00:03:08.190> never<00:03:08.580> been<00:03:08.730> seen<00:03:08.970> before<00:03:09.000> really<00:03:09.600> and

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
gates never been seen before really and

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.009 
gates never been seen before really and
what<00:03:11.519> would<00:03:11.610> be<00:03:11.670> nicer<00:03:12.090> let<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.720> time<00:03:12.810> do

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
what would be nicer let your time do

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.520 
what would be nicer let your time do
eight<00:03:13.230> gates<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.769> now<00:03:13.890> like<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.030> like<00:03:15.530> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
eight gates and now like really like it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.009 
eight gates and now like really like it
would<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.680> great<00:03:17.220> time<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.450> guess

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
would be great time you know I guess

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.350 
would be great time you know I guess
just<00:03:19.200> unleash<00:03:19.709> all<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> best<00:03:20.340> attacks<00:03:20.790> at<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
just unleash all the best attacks at the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.560 
just unleash all the best attacks at the
end<00:03:21.570> actually<00:03:22.110> at<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.380> climax<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:24.180> climax

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
end actually at the climax of the climax

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.940 
end actually at the climax of the climax
on<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.690> series<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:25.470> would<00:03:25.709> be<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.830> great

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
on a series like this would be a great

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.550 
on a series like this would be a great
time<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.600> so<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.810> think<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.230> supposed<00:03:28.470> to

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
time do it so I do think you supposed to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.320 
time do it so I do think you supposed to
take<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.920> his<00:03:29.010> advantage<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:30.030> make

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
take that to his advantage and just make

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.190 
take that to his advantage and just make
a<00:03:30.360> huge<00:03:30.870> huge<00:03:31.220> climactic<00:03:32.220> point<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:33.030> guy<00:03:33.420> does

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
a huge huge climactic point one guy does

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
a huge huge climactic point one guy does
