I<00:02:29.270> chose<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.470> use<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:31.010> rhinestone<00:02:31.489> Brad

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I chose to use a little rhinestone Brad

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.150 
I chose to use a little rhinestone Brad
that<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.000> had<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:33.050> put<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.739> center

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
that I had and I put that in the center

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.600 
that I had and I put that in the center
and<00:02:34.420> then<00:02:35.420> just<00:02:35.750> pull<00:02:36.080> back<00:02:36.380> my<00:02:36.739> proms<00:02:37.310> and

that<00:02:38.209> will<00:02:38.390> hold<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:39.470> is

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that will hold that now this is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.930 
that will hold that now this is
something<00:02:39.920> maybe<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.370> could<00:02:40.519> use<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:40.910> a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
something maybe you could use it with a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.530 
something maybe you could use it with a
banner<00:02:42.040> use<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.580> with<00:02:43.760> some<00:02:43.940> decorations

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
banner use it just with some decorations

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.630 
banner use it just with some decorations
but<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.349> want<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.650> make<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.099> pinwheel<00:02:46.370> that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
but if you want to make a pinwheel that

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.270 
but if you want to make a pinwheel that
actually<00:02:47.120> turns<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:48.709> one<00:02:48.890> instead<00:02:49.220> of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
actually turns and this one instead of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.789 
actually turns and this one instead of
the<00:02:49.610> little<00:02:49.850> instead<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.959> little<00:02:51.850> Brad<00:02:52.850> I

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
the little instead of the little Brad I

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.120 
the little instead of the little Brad I
put<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:55.130> pushpin<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.450> i<00:02:57.380> only<00:02:57.680> had<00:02:57.799> skewer

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
put a pushpin and i only had skewer

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.340 
put a pushpin and i only had skewer
sticks<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.790> they're<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.299> not<00:02:59.569> quite<00:03:00.080> big

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
sticks and they're really not quite big

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.320 
sticks and they're really not quite big
enough<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.739> do<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.040> because<00:03:01.340> i<00:03:01.580> kind<00:03:02.180> of

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
enough to do this because i kind of

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.860 
enough to do this because i kind of
split<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.440> find<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.250> bigger<00:03:04.580> dowel<00:03:05.120> but

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
split that so find a bigger dowel but

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.930 
split that so find a bigger dowel but
dolls<00:03:06.230> are<00:03:06.440> easy<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.950> find<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.370> think<00:03:07.400> they<00:03:07.819> even

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
dolls are easy to find I think they even

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
dolls are easy to find I think they even
have<00:03:08.209> them<00:03:08.360> in<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:09.260> mine<00:03:09.440> craft<00:03:09.650> stores<00:03:09.950> our

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
have them in that mine craft stores our

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.350 
have them in that mine craft stores our
walmart<00:03:11.209> has<00:03:11.390> one<00:03:12.340> hardware<00:03:13.340> stores<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.090> as

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
walmart has one hardware stores and as

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.320 
walmart has one hardware stores and as
long<00:03:14.540> as<00:03:14.690> your<00:03:14.810> hole<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.260> big<00:03:15.440> enough<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.670> pin

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
long as your hole is big enough the pin

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.740 
long as your hole is big enough the pin
will<00:03:18.019> hold<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.500> into<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.610> dowel<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.180> then<00:03:20.510> it

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
will hold it into the dowel and then it

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.410 
will hold it into the dowel and then it
will<00:03:20.930> actually<00:03:21.140> spin<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:22.519> one<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.820> was<00:03:23.120> kind

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
will actually spin this one I was kind

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.410 
will actually spin this one I was kind
of<00:03:24.400> well<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.459> suppose<00:03:25.700> she<00:03:25.790> could<00:03:25.820> put<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.269> on

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
of well I suppose she could put it on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.000 
of well I suppose she could put it on
you<00:03:26.630> could<00:03:26.780> hot<00:03:26.930> glue<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.500> top<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:27.950> a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
you could hot glue it to the top of a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.380 
you could hot glue it to the top of a
pin<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.310> then<00:03:28.400> put<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> dowel<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.209> it

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
pin and then put it in a dowel and it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.819 
pin and then put it in a dowel and it
would<00:03:29.540> spin<00:03:29.750> but<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> was<00:03:30.560> kind<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.769> thinking

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
would spin but I was kind of thinking

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.460 
would spin but I was kind of thinking
more<00:03:31.190> decoration<00:03:31.790> with<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:32.120> one<00:03:32.359> so<00:03:33.140> we<00:03:33.319> have

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
more decoration with this one so we have

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.140 
more decoration with this one so we have
the<00:03:33.620> non<00:03:33.769> spinning<00:03:34.250> one<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.700> one<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.030> you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the non spinning one and one that you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.970 
the non spinning one and one that you
could<00:03:35.329> spin<00:03:35.569> make<00:03:36.260> sure<00:03:36.410> your<00:03:36.530> hole<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:36.859> big

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
could spin make sure your hole is big

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.680 
could spin make sure your hole is big
enough<00:03:37.040> so<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.549> spins<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.420> can<00:03:38.600> make

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
enough so that it spins you can make

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.080 
enough so that it spins you can make
little<00:03:38.840> ones<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.380> put<00:03:39.859> them<00:03:39.920> on<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.160> card<00:03:40.489> like

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
little ones and put them on a card like

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.970 
little ones and put them on a card like
this<00:03:41.150> if<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.200> have<00:03:42.319> any<00:03:42.410> questions<00:03:42.799> about
