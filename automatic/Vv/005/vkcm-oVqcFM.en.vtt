this telephone had a bridge rectifier
added<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.220> it<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.900> basically<00:00:33.900> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
added to it and basically this is the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.250 
added to it and basically this is the
bridge<00:00:34.830> rectifier<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:36.870> top

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
bridge rectifier right here it's on top

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.790 
bridge rectifier right here it's on top
of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:38.040> wiring<00:00:38.720> right<00:00:39.720> here<00:00:39.990> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.380> network

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of the wiring right here on the network

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.090 
of the wiring right here on the network
which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.970> perfectly<00:00:42.720> fine<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.560> sit<00:00:43.860> there

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
which is perfectly fine it can sit there

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.200 
which is perfectly fine it can sit there
it's<00:00:44.220> not<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> hurt<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.970> thing<00:00:45.240> and<00:00:47.210> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it's not going to hurt a thing and it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.340 
it's not going to hurt a thing and it
should<00:00:48.540> be<00:00:50.390> secure<00:00:51.390> enough<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.200> it's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
should be secure enough now that it's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.180 
should be secure enough now that it's
okay<00:00:52.740> I<00:00:53.060> want<00:00:54.060> to<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.750> piece<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> geta

okay I want to put a piece of geta
the<00:00:56.520> capacitor<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.510> added<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.110> want<00:00:58.950> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the capacitor that we added I want to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.720 
the capacitor that we added I want to
put<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.220> piece<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.670> sticky<00:01:00.660> tape<00:01:01.430> I'll<00:01:02.430> show<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
put a piece of sticky tape I'll show you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.289 
put a piece of sticky tape I'll show you
here<00:01:02.970> real<00:01:03.180> quick<00:01:03.469> what<00:01:04.469> I'm<00:01:04.559> talking<00:01:04.920> about

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299

here real quick what I'm talking about
double-sided<00:01:06.299> sticky<00:01:06.689> tape<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:08.039> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
double-sided sticky tape it's not a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.810 
double-sided sticky tape it's not a
necessity<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:09.149> we<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.039> okay<00:01:11.039> it's<00:01:11.640> just

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
necessity that we do this okay it's just

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.800 
necessity that we do this okay it's just
something<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.899> to<00:01:13.109> do<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:15.450> wouldn't

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
something that I like to do it wouldn't

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
something that I like to do it wouldn't
hurt<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.170> thing<00:01:16.469> if<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.789> sitting<00:01:18.149> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
hurt a thing if it was just sitting in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.649 
hurt a thing if it was just sitting in
there<00:01:18.539> I<00:01:18.749> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.499> trim<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.009> tape<00:01:20.509> to<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
there I want to trim this tape to the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.059 
there I want to trim this tape to the
size<00:01:21.899> of<00:01:22.079> the<00:01:22.200> capacitor<00:01:22.399> basically<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.920> we're

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
size of the capacitor basically so we're

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.779 
size of the capacitor basically so we're
going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.219> stick<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.759> there<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:32.759> just

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
going to stick that on there it just

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.419 
going to stick that on there it just
gives<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.359> little<00:01:33.539> neater<00:01:33.869> appearance<00:01:34.429> it's

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
gives it a little neater appearance it's

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.239 
gives it a little neater appearance it's
not<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:35.999> to<00:01:36.060> hurt<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> thing<00:01:36.569> if<00:01:36.749> it<00:01:36.899> wasn't

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:43.279 

if<00:01:41.249> it<00:01:41.429> wasn't<00:01:41.789> mounted<00:01:42.210> down<00:01:42.420> because<00:01:43.020> we

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
if it wasn't mounted down because we

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.480 
if it wasn't mounted down because we
could<00:01:43.469> just<00:01:43.709> stick<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.069> on<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> wiring

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
could just stick it on the wiring

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.830 
could just stick it on the wiring
harness<00:01:44.969> here

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.830 

and<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> should<00:01:55.260> do<00:01:55.440> it

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
and that should do it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.180 
and that should do it
that's<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> looks<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:02.040> that

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
that's kind of how that looks and that

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.690 
that's kind of how that looks and that
should<00:02:02.369> hold<00:02:02.549> down<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:03.540> good<00:02:04.670> we've<00:02:05.670> done

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
should hold down pretty good we've done

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
should hold down pretty good we've done
enough<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.330> these<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.470> know<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
enough of these to where we know that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.949 
enough of these to where we know that
that'll<00:02:08.190> settle<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.300> should<00:02:09.479> hold<00:02:09.660> pretty

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that'll settle that should hold pretty

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.960 
that'll settle that should hold pretty
good<00:02:12.140> anyway<00:02:13.140> let's<00:02:13.590> take<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.430> telephone

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
good anyway let's take this telephone

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.960 
good anyway let's take this telephone
and<00:02:15.209> we'll<00:02:16.850> swing<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.970> around<00:02:18.060> here<00:02:21.769> get<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and we'll swing it around here get it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.850 
and we'll swing it around here get it
get<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> few<00:02:24.360> things<00:02:24.660> together<00:02:24.900> here<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:39.860

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
look at the put the body back on then

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.630 
look at the put the body back on then
we'll<00:02:40.019> secure<00:02:40.260> everything<00:02:40.709> down<00:02:41.130> after<00:02:41.519> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
we'll secure everything down after the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:59.539 
we'll secure everything down after the
video<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.000> want<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.300> plug<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:57.530> okay<00:02:58.549> that's
