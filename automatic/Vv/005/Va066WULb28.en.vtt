00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the case like it may have a few lines

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.090 
the case like it may have a few lines
here<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> mean<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> really

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
here and there but I mean it is a really

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
here and there but I mean it is a really
good<00:01:53.250> case<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.729> thick<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.930> have

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
good case it's thick so you don't have

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630 
good case it's thick so you don't have
to<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.350> worry<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> bumping<00:01:56.520> or

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to really worry about it bumping or

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.539 
to really worry about it bumping or
anything<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.860> love<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.040> case<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
anything like that I love this case and

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.130 
anything like that I love this case and
that<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.820> why<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.030> decided<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.719> second

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that was why I decided to get a second

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.870 
that was why I decided to get a second
one<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.799> happy<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.369> release<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
one I was happy that they release it in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
one I was happy that they release it in
America<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.570> figuring<00:02:04.049> oh<00:02:04.229> well<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
America as I was figuring oh well I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
America as I was figuring oh well I
guess<00:02:05.820> I'll<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.360> my<00:02:06.540> accessories

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
guess I'll just get all my accessories

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.080 
guess I'll just get all my accessories
from<00:02:07.140> Japan<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.799> this

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
from Japan for this

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.729 
from Japan for this
because<00:02:08.509> even<00:02:08.929> though<00:02:09.019> it's<00:02:09.170> been<00:02:09.319> out<00:02:09.500> for

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
because even though it's been out for

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.559 
because even though it's been out for
over<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.069> year<00:02:10.099> now<00:02:10.310> they're<00:02:10.700> not<00:02:10.910> very<00:02:11.269> many

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
over a year now they're not very many

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.589 
over a year now they're not very many
cases<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.379> excel<00:02:12.769> I<00:02:13.330> don't<00:02:14.330> know<00:02:14.480> if

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
cases for the excel I don't know if

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.089 
cases for the excel I don't know if
these<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.930> available<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.319> stores<00:02:15.620> yet<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:15.950> not

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
these are available in stores yet or not

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.300 
these are available in stores yet or not
but<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.910> able<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> get<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> online<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.920> only

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
but I was able to get it online the only

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.580 
but I was able to get it online the only
difference<00:02:19.849> between<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.660> case<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
difference between this case and the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.509 
difference between this case and the
American<00:02:22.280> case<00:02:22.459> is<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:23.720> label<00:02:24.170> right<00:02:24.319> here<00:02:24.519> it

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
American case is the label right here it

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.740 
American case is the label right here it
says<00:02:26.060> 3d<00:02:26.480> ll<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.769> Japanese<00:02:28.220> one<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:29.629> I'll

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
says 3d ll on the Japanese one and I'll

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.300 
says 3d ll on the Japanese one and I'll
show<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.110> American<00:02:30.620> one<00:02:32.739> once<00:02:33.739> again<00:02:33.920> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
show you the American one once again it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.250 
show you the American one once again it
is<00:02:34.430> exactly<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:35.030> same<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.599> Japanese<00:02:36.049> one

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
is exactly the same as the Japanese one

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400 
is exactly the same as the Japanese one
in<00:02:36.440> quality<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.450> markings<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:39.110> fit

in quality in markings the fit

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.330 
in quality in markings the fit
everything<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:40.190> exactly<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.760> same<00:02:42.340> it's

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
everything is exactly the same it's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.960 
everything is exactly the same it's
suffer<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.269> says<00:02:44.630> 3ds<00:02:45.079> XL<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.970> small

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
suffer here it says 3ds XL a small

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.250 
suffer here it says 3ds XL a small
difference<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:47.599> wouldn't<00:02:47.900> even<00:02:47.959> notice

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
difference that you wouldn't even notice

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920 
difference that you wouldn't even notice
and<00:02:48.709> honestly<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.160> didn't<00:02:49.640> notice<00:02:49.970> until<00:02:50.120> I

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
and honestly I didn't notice until I

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.229 
and honestly I didn't notice until I
don't<00:02:51.620> know<00:02:51.799> how<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.040> had<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> case<00:02:52.670> about<00:02:52.910> you

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
don't know how I had the case about you

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.390 
don't know how I had the case about you
know<00:02:53.390> maybe<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.319> week<00:02:54.410> before<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.920> noticed<00:02:55.250> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
know maybe a week before I noticed that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.819 
know maybe a week before I noticed that
so<00:02:57.819> that's<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:59.000> only<00:02:59.030> difference<00:02:59.329> if<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.379> open

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
so that's the only difference if I open

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.119 
so that's the only difference if I open
it<00:03:01.510> you'll<00:03:02.510> see<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.319> wraps<00:03:03.530> around<00:03:03.769> at

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
it you'll see that it wraps around at

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.610 
it you'll see that it wraps around at
the<00:03:04.250> bottom<00:03:04.400> just<00:03:04.670> like<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> pink<00:03:05.150> one<00:03:05.329> did<00:03:05.620> it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the bottom just like the pink one did it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.589 
the bottom just like the pink one did it
has<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.040> little<00:03:08.920> overlap<00:03:09.920> here<00:03:10.510> or<00:03:11.510> the

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
has this little overlap here or the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:19.990 
has this little overlap here or the
palms<00:03:11.870> rest<00:03:12.319> and<00:03:12.709> everything<00:03:17.380> if<00:03:18.380> it's<00:03:19.069> just

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
palms rest and everything if it's just

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.640 
palms rest and everything if it's just
like<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.450> other<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:20.900> did<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:24.380> was<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
like the other one did that was the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.370 
like the other one did that was the
American<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.609> this<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.090> Japanese<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.049> open

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
American and this is Japanese and I open

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.470 
American and this is Japanese and I open
it<00:03:29.859> exactly<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.040> same

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
it exactly the same

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.229 
it exactly the same
the<00:03:32.480> quality<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.049> exactly<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> same<00:03:33.889> if<00:03:34.639> you

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
the quality is exactly the same if you

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.819 
the quality is exactly the same if you
were<00:03:35.359> looking<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:35.870> one<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.170> these<00:03:36.319> and

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
were looking to get one of these and

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.259 
were looking to get one of these and
maybe<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.430> weren't<00:03:37.579> sure<00:03:37.849> if<00:03:37.970> there<00:03:38.120> was<00:03:38.239> a

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
maybe you weren't sure if there was a

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.940 
maybe you weren't sure if there was a
difference<00:03:38.690> or<00:03:39.349> you<00:03:39.470> didn't<00:03:39.680> even<00:03:39.739> know<00:03:39.919> that

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
difference or you didn't even know that

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.470 
difference or you didn't even know that
they<00:03:40.130> had<00:03:40.250> releases<00:03:40.609> in<00:03:40.730> America<00:03:41.150> yes<00:03:41.329> they

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
they had releases in America yes they

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.509 
they had releases in America yes they
did<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.169> quality<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.680> exactly<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.400> same

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
did and the quality is exactly the same

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.550 
did and the quality is exactly the same
as<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.760> Japanese<00:03:44.180> one<00:03:44.419> I<00:03:45.910> will<00:03:46.910> say<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.480> if<00:03:48.290> I

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
as the Japanese one I will say that if I

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.309 
as the Japanese one I will say that if I
were<00:03:48.769> going<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.669> decide<00:03:50.030> which<00:03:50.419> once<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:50.930> get

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
were going to decide which once you get

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.949 
were going to decide which once you get
I<00:03:51.620> would<00:03:51.739> probably<00:03:52.340> go<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.959> American

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
I would probably go with the American

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.800 
I would probably go with the American
one<00:03:54.169> just<00:03:55.160> because<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.519> shipped<00:03:56.150> clicker<00:03:56.450> and

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
one just because it shipped clicker and
