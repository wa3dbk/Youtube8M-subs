00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 today we are going to make this top for the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.880
 barbie doll and we will need line 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 silk in the color you 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 prefer crochet needle and 1 75 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.650
 skate and treasure 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:35.160
 Let's start our work by doing 6 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:38.129
 two current currents and over 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 these chains let's make six points 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 high 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.809
 counting on the three chains that we are going to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.809
 make to climb 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:19.100
 six high points on 6 corinthians 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.870
 now we're going to turn and make but three 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.920
 chains to climb 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.820
 thrown on the needle at the next high point 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.780
 we will make a high point in the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:38.750
 next more half high point and date 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:44.030
 all together in the next 6 high point in the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:50.240
 next half high point of the party all 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:52.600
 together in the next a high point will 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.600
 stay 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.580
 this way we will become another two 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.260
 chains to climb into the room on the needle 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.729
 in the next point half a point high 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:16.270
 next point or half a point high in the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.270
 next point half high point 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.300
 Let's close it all together let's do it 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.709
 now 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.709
 twenty-two chains 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:57.560
 Now we'll cut the shot with a 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:01.940
 lighter is ready first side of the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.269
 Our top now you book this part 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.510
 and repeat the same process by doing another 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:14.780
 side made other side let's get it already 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.379
 I left ready here across a feat 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:23.530
 Let's get it and let's go friends. 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.530
 again make 22 more chains 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.189
 made 22 chains we'll get 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.049
 one of the sides of our top introduce the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:59.150
 our needle 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:03.799
 the first base point and let's 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:15.709
 walk to the other side of the dop in 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:21.109
 very low points 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.840
 we take the other side in the same position 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.300
 that we did nor is this we will do with 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.610
 this will introduce our fat into the 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:37.750
 first base point and walk to 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.750
 other side in very low points 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:54.529
 on the other side, let's do more 

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.529
 22 chains 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.950
 made 22 cot and bolts 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:40.270
 Now we're going to cast off all the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:46.240
 tips that were in the top searches 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:50.530
 Always fasten the inside side 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:55.600
 our top, or on the wrong side of the 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:58.140
 will not stay appearing in the 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.140
 bolts 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.780
 our touch is ready 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.300
 Thank you girls and they can accompany you. 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.960
 now you will have enough video all over 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.210
