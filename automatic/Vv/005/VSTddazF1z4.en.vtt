00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.180
 hi all the guys are squares 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.550
 welcome to this new video in the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.920
 second episode of the series attacks 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.650
 unlikely this today we are here with a 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.810
 very particular attack be with a 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.060
 balloon goblin attack the goblins 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.350
 the useless fatah ranks for this 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.730
 attack and we have 32 hot air balloons and some 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:39.260
 in clans 2 to 4 and 2 others as potions 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.930
 I took a fury and 2 cures e 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.120
 let's try to see what we can 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.699
 do obviously need to do 50 for 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.650
 a hundred or so the municipality must 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.339
 make at least one star 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.350
 I remember because for those who did not have 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.699
 followed the first video found in 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.089
 descriptions and in any case the first video 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.280
 they go looking for a challenger to pull 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.019
 down and see you when you find someone 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.990
 not too strong because you have to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.119
 being able to do is obviously a star 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.010
 the minimum requirement of the municipality of 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.470
 village must be the town hall vii 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.729
 vii least hall were a thing 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.409
 I added now why if I had to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.240
 find a principle 4 the better you don't 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.520
 find however if I were it is too simple 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.719
 but from the research of this municipality vii 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.329
 doable 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.770
 I would attack guys I would attack 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.390
 he and an angry barbarian king 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.899
 split where they were to break the area 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.899
 but why because yes 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.600
 kat knows I threw it too much 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.149
 too external to a card no 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.899
 no no I did it right right in 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.899
 blog time 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.940
 ok let's throw the goblins here on their own 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:14.209
 ok let's go let's go to force force 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:22.310
 that you have to do slaughter where the fuck you are 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:24.410
 going you others a nice care here bob 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:30.200
 language and by what we are going to do 50 for 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:35.019
 one hundred but more I also believe 54 56 buoy 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 goal made certain that the goblins 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.950
 quite useless words no by now 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.140
 this here is neither should it be 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.109
 for the time it should be 100 percent 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.980
 I believe except for serious unforeseen events 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:52.480
 in short, everything is taken, we are 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.630
 going to the town hall miss ha 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.160
 also demolished the north gobbi that not 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.070
 have nothing left to smash they go towards 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.540
 the defenses therefore in short here it is 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.530
 even managed a good 100 per 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.170
 perfect perfect hundred that quick 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 goblins that are just missing the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.709
 spell factory and settled in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.329
 make our three stars and attack 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.940
 canine 31 compensation with the excuse I have 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.330
 also made some trophies in I would say that 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.550
 we are here we are all right 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.650
 I finally look here because I have 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.870
 the goal here however is the screen there 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.320
 ergo if I don't look from here I look at it from there 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.260
 so you understand nothing I am with the face 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.480
 cannes and avoid comments to the hair 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.220
 long I know I have to cut them are very 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.070
 long are so many are below like 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.360
 manage them and let's start right away with the 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.640
 second attack of this video 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.480
 obviously it will be the same and let's go to 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.160
 looking for an opponent we'll see each other 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.680
 to the new opponent we are better than 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.330
 attack him because he is scarce because he is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:03.360
 poor and yes therefore barbarian king we rage 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:09.700
 the king with the goblins we break this here 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.430
 ok and let's launch some hot air balloons a little 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.420
 of here it is a bit of here however detached 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.489
 because otherwise we take it 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.290
 I don't tell you where because it doesn't seem to me 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.170
 home care here is another bit of 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.210
 in the meantime I would say balloons 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.010
 sorry framing if I don't look at you 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.380
 But in the sense I should start well for 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.660
 does the same however anyway at the end are 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.510
 I try these so I mean how 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 comes 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.010
 launch the other hot air balloons here and there 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.530
 last six here here is promises 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.960
 will be another hundred percent does not know 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.430
 in the meantime I can talk to you a little 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.500
 first of all, this is a comfortable thing 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.380
 I tell you that I have a pimple here is called 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.150
 this thing and I would say to pass into 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.750
 facebook page in description why 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.030
 there are so many beautiful things there is a 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.640
 fuck the poor out of pity 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.750
 attention what happens to my queen bars 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.360
 hundred percent 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.960
 no the standard no ok, that's right 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.509
 on the single shot 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.300
 and anyway I could do so I couldn't 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.889
 do so i don't know i could do in 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.449
 some way to frame but me 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:29.240
 I have to study a little and I owe it to me 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.860
 to study a little I said first of all we are 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.199
 6,000 who has already said it not last 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.289
 video advise me in other comments 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:39.050
 attacks to make I thought hot air balloons 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.360
 goblin you may be maybe not tell me 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.819
 golems and boys do not stand the micello goals 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.979
 sappe i don't have them golem i 'm doing le 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.349
 Valkyrie is now a time to do it 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.389
 copro is once made and made 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.680
 valkyries can go for goals and more 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.840
 forward though if it takes a while and then 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.490
 I don't know how to tell me some comments 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.660
 nice pairing to do and we do 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.449
 if he takes the comment that the only way 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.830
 with which you can communicate with me and 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.690
 we try to get here also to a 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.759
 I like number Monday but I ask you 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.080
 because if not me if the inter rom not 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.060
 because I'm a jerk our norm 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.470
 because if you don't care and posters 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.060
 I can understand it, God forbid 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.680
 I interrupt her and marine comments to me 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.900
 suggest other things to do ie not 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.430
 there is no problem here as we go to 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.470
 do one hundred percent and we did 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.330
 two 200 percent attacks to say that 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.539
 this attacks the two attacks on you 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.130
 more than good of course maybe from the 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.430
 since it begins to be a little 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.539
 Simple depends on the troops you use 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:40.520
 let's do that which can 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:43.009
 to attack only of the municipality viii e 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.080
 on depends what troops are used because if 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.120
 I had to use the town hall dragons vii in 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.090
 on the town hall there are two defenses with the hands 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.460
 I put on three lightning is very simple 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.590
 then species such as species because then I 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.030
 others let alone in girls 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.380
 also this episode of attacks 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.760
 unlikely to come to an end 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.170
 I thank you and invite you to leave 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.000
 I like it if you want to join the 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.800
 channel if you haven't done it yet 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.440
 because he had never seen me here 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.690
 I'm an 18-year-old boy e 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.370
 nothing i think is all i have from 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.740
 tell you I greet you and thank you
