00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.439
 a shocking 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.829
 after analyzing the environment of windows 7 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.779

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.509
 the screen protector 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.859
 the color and appearance of the windows 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 the screen 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.710
 licona change the appearance of the screen 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.580
 the window or personalization 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.750
 with concern the koalas that will intervene is convenient to have the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.909
 correctly configured desktop screen 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.909
 so that we find pleasant experience with the team 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.020
 to all the screen settings options it always makes great of the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.820
 nation 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.790
 after analyzing the screen relations 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.330
 well the data of the college of great right of the naan on the desk 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.100
 the customization window is made up of more than a central one that 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 includes the different themes and actions to modify them 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 the plant more related options 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.080
 the creams 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.150
 a subject that is a set of appearance destinations are flooded and with the others 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.170
 they are the siphon 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.270
 those of steve jobs 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.040
 that can be applied all at once 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.780
 the idea is to choose any of the most watched of the exclusion of honey 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 from the list that appears here the sale the personalization 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.020
 if we have changed the aspects of the zonal theme 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 we should value it as a new topic official taxes own issues 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.300
 personalized 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.680
 in the form of a desk 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.850
 the image that appears on the stage on which psychologists are shown 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.420
 it's called wallpaper 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.490
 we can customize this image of the sacred NATO hopefully desktop 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.080
 from there we can choose one of the images that incorporates windows 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.750
 oscar 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.040
 in the team we can also see that at the beginning the window is prepared if 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 repeat the arcs of jeter 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.169
 the screen protector 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.409
 once again it remained static for a long time it can be harmful to the 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.029
 screen seems to have too much intensity is located at the same point 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.219
 although it approaches the screen 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.309
 also that although it will be activated when the equipment is well planned during 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:37.060
 some time and in this way it will be avoided that the band suffers these years 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.379
 to access its configuration we think about people about screen 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:48.479
 we will give edition of the sector for him is not eligible pt out how many fines should 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:52.969
 wait to stay despite unemployment aside we will need a sale 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.459
 they had logged in 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.499
 color and appearance of the windows 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.829
 another thing that we can consider that slip and the appearance of 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.319
 windows 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.199
 we can change the color of the bar this year the window is a law of 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.849
 transparency 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.849
 these sanctions are found by pulsing angel betancourt to the window inside 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.079
 the customization window 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 the screen and how to change its appearance 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.920
 tabasqueÃ±as behind the behavior of the screen as for example the 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.540
 resolution the parliament the text we have revealed that before relation of 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.319
 screen but celebrates from the control panel appearance of personalization and 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.829
 screen 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.730
 The larger the solution, the more information to demonstrate in the 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:47.209
 screen and with better quality although the size of the offers will be lower 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.959
 we can also change the quality of the kodak that are normally at maximum 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:59.879
 complete the premiere on the subject by seeing how we ensure some examples 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.690
 gemba aesthetic appearance screen 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.809
 apply creams and control the screen 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:10.469
 put your knowledge to the test of other agents that we propose 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.309
 also detects screen
