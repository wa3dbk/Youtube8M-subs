00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.949
 but the joy and welcome to another edition of the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.880
 Rebuild hbz on the way 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 we see 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.439
 it is summer again the first 12 Tel July 2010 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.579
 the World Cup is over 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.999
 Switzerland did not make it all over Germany 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.920
 Congratulations to third place 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.420
 Austria will start Alexis year again and this one represents my opinion 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 South Tyrol could, of course, Italy 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.710
 Sixth Marbert will make a little better on that 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.180
 for the next six weeks, by the way, summery for me 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.460
 time management what does it mean here maybe it's his former keeper too 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.510
 Carsten 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.109
 work in the morning 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.470
 after car hire 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.450
 the reason is the blessing 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.460
 Northrend I noticed it last year there is absolutely nothing life I have 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.890
 I even get the impression I have as much in those six weeks as I do 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.010
 I would work all day because if I have only half a day available 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.790
 so I have to live my true van son 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
 Do it in half a day is that easy 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.300
 In the last four months, a question caught busy 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.560
 how is it? 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.700
 People are there 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.210
 after a cockpit make sure they really in their lives the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.650
 Depart post 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
 others in turn grandma thinks 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 somehow I am not understood correctly 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.240
 let's talk a different language 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.800
 Opel what exactly is the problem 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.960
 I was gone 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 coincidentally in quotes at such an exquisite keeps it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.219
 an attachment Deckert and the Roth &amp; Rau and in the expression as applied 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.010
 I was skeptical about being a professional 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.990
 and knows today why he does not because it is so the transfer of the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.390
 Austro Control for me ranting them out I will not name any names now 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.289
 which I always give her for it 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.159
 in the media Ehrenberger of forecasts of himself 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.969
 no matter whether they prove themselves or not I find it irresponsible federal 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.129
 probably harms the call of astrology Eno and that is precisely the 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.989
 People who prostitute themselves 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.529
 They should not be surprised if their profession suffers the most 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.559
 if you practice astrology reasonably and responsibly 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.779
 just does not hang on the big bell but simply in individual advice 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.209
 passes 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.430
 then that is a very nice and the rest of the thing I have the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.869
 last six tried in the arms 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.869

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.659
 It is important that you get away from these computer-generated text modules 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.719
 colonoscopy 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.140
 they simply work each and every aspect in turn 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.059
 and when will a whole picture of a birth house Probst 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.669
 simply not fair 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:06.899
 A sensible and responsible interpretations should be in the trash 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.459
 Conversation take place in private 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.949
 one also cares to get away from DICE Stammtisch astrology cheerfully that 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.689
 special character 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.760
 maybe at best even more audacious band will be interpreted there are still quite 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.050
 other SES important factors that must be considered 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.539
 to do justice to the overall course of a person 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.159

 what just said i just want holistic thinking 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.389

 not just prove how can I make my next million 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.079

 I have ascended that had always problems with certain 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.439
 People and today I know what these are for people 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.190

 he is emotional and herbs i know that i like with those 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:52.889

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.449
 I do not always succeed right away but I will definitely bother
