at 25 carats five carats five of each
card<00:01:16.189> statistically<00:01:17.210> watch<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.390> aiming<00:01:18.540> for

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
card statistically watch are aiming for

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.399 
card statistically watch are aiming for
is<00:01:21.259> 525<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.040> five<00:01:23.450> correct<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is 525 so one in five correct and the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
is 525 so one in five correct and the
more<00:01:25.590> people<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.250> obviously<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> can't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
more people do this obviously you can't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
more people do this obviously you can't
redo<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> video

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
redo this one again because it's a video

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.950 
redo this one again because it's a video
and<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.189> done<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.610> st.<00:01:29.850> cards<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:33.750> higher

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and so done in st. cards is the higher

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
and so done in st. cards is the higher
