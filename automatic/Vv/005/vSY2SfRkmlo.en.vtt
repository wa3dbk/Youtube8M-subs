00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.520
 the core of a coloring pencil does not 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.710
 contains mine is composed of 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.460
 mineral pigments and agents 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.460
 binders 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.330
 this company invented a unique type of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.250
 crayons the composition of the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.439
 mine allows you to wet it with a little water 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.830
 to create an effect of paintings of 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.830
 watercolor 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.410
 and the manufacturing starts with a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 combination of pigments each tone 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.660
 corresponds to a specific recipe from 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 pigments 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.150
 a lot of a tone is produced 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.309
 at the same time following the recipe of that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.260
 color are meticulously begun 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.260
 different portions of ingredients 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.420
 boil a specific amount of 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.730
 water and preservatives and agents are added 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.230
 Binder is a secret mixture of 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.230
 resin gums or waxes 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 i 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.640
 the ingredients expand in the water 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.740
 hot and a paste is formed 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.729
 the workers mix the pigments 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 with this pasta 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.310
 in the next machine it processes the pasta 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.009
 to form thin pieces intensifying 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 the color the pieces advance on a ribbon 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.570
 conveyor to a cylinder that 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.229
 compress then take them to a machine 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.229
 extrusion 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.990
 the machine squeezes the paste in a spray 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 continuous diameter of the mine 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 pencil 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.670
 in a secret process the following 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.300
 machine cuts this long mine to give 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.300
 the right size 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.870
 but mines can not write it 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.870
 they bathe in a mixture of chemical waxes 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.920
 these are discovered and impregnated the mines 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.920
 in this case red 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.879
 and the wax is used to apply the color to 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 As it is drawn it is rubbed and 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.430
 Adhere to the paper by applying the pigment 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.430
 in this 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.069
 with the finished sights the factory 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.860
 submits random samples to a control 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.170
 of quality that includes tests of 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.890
 resistance and durability in which 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.430
 each mine must draw 100 meters 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.430
 the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.800
 this company makes the bodies of their 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.530
 pencils with cedar wood this machine 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.300
 carving slots for mines then covers 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.959
 the surface with a thin layer of 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.959
 glue 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.579
 the boards pass under a wheel that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.579
 positions the mines 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.940
 and then by another machine that puts a 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.940
 second board slotted on top 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.160
 the next machine carves the shape 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.380
 hexagonal 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.380
 then cut and separate the pencils 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.260
 one at a time the pencils go through a 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.030
 color varnish bath now the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.100
 exterior has the same color as the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.760
 admire inside 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.760
 do not 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.019
 once the enamel dries it 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.879
 Hot stamp the brand and number 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.500
 of color in the wood the letters are 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.500
 complete with a color film 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.090
 the pencils go through an abrasive wheel 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.090
 that sharpens them as you go 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.200
 the tip without tip receives a layer of 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.980
 white enamel or the same tone of 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.980
 pencil blade 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.950
 the machines of the factory carry the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.480
 colors determined to the area of 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.579
 packing 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.889
 while the pencils slide down the 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.639
 slotted tray is visually checked 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.639
 each 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.680
 from pigment and wood to a medium 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.480
 artistic the process to make pencils 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.480
 of colors is full of nuances
