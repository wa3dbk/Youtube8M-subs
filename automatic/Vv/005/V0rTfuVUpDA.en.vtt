00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
is I break up the plant into a number of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
is I break up the plant into a number of
different<00:00:25.230> shapes<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:26.490> there's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> plant<00:00:27.090> out

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
there that to perform any trick you want

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.720 
there that to perform any trick you want
it<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.019> believe<00:00:31.019> me<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.410> any<00:00:32.009> country<00:00:32.550> in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it to do believe me in any country in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.420 
it to do believe me in any country in
any<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.690> any<00:00:33.899> atmosphere<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> quite

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
any in any atmosphere is it is quite

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
any in any atmosphere is it is quite
amazing<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.170> got<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.530> about

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
amazing so you got to think about

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.080 
amazing so you got to think about
putting<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.280> plant<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.850> right

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
putting the right plant in the right

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.670 
putting the right plant in the right
place<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.390> what<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> did<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> broke<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.530> these

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
place so what I did was I broke up these

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.150 
place so what I did was I broke up these
plants<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.820> series<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.950> structures<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
plants into a series of structures and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.479 
plants into a series of structures and
so<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:45.379> that<00:00:46.379> something<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so I know that something like this is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.410 
so I know that something like this is
under<00:00:48.210> perform<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> call<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> floor<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
under perform what I call a floor and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.910 
under perform what I call a floor and
when<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.170> go<00:00:52.320> wow<00:00:52.559> that's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
when I look at this and I go wow that's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
when I look at this and I go wow that's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
array of sunlight because i know this

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.719 
array of sunlight because i know this
thing<00:01:58.110> needs<00:01:58.229> about<00:01:58.500> six<00:01:58.770> hours<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> direct

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
thing needs about six hours of direct

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.209 
thing needs about six hours of direct
sunlight<00:02:00.000> per<00:02:00.509> day<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> go<00:02:01.619> okay<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:02.070> my

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
sunlight per day so I go okay that's my

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.950 
sunlight per day so I go okay that's my
accent<00:02:02.640> plant<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> look<00:02:03.810> at

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
accent plant and then I look at

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230 
accent plant and then I look at
something<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.909> where<00:02:06.149> I've

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
something like this you know where I've

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.290 
something like this you know where I've
got<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.509> podocarpus<00:02:07.170> icy<00:02:07.469> blue<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:08.009> well

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
got my podocarpus icy blue and I go well

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.999 
got my podocarpus icy blue and I go well
that's<00:02:09.300> an<00:02:09.509> amazing<00:02:09.750> plant<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.830> just

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that's an amazing plant like it's just

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700 
that's an amazing plant like it's just
blew<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.730> ties<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.959> blue<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
blew it ties in with the blue and the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.100 
blew it ties in with the blue and the
Garvey<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.250> I've<00:02:14.580> got<00:02:14.760> my<00:02:14.790> colors<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.480> it's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
Garvey so I've got my colors right it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.480 
Garvey so I've got my colors right it's
got<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> completely<00:02:16.740> different<00:02:17.040> texture<00:02:17.460> than

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
got a completely different texture than

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.300 
got a completely different texture than
what's<00:02:17.880> over<00:02:18.120> there<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.170> fact<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
what's over there but in fact this is a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.420 
what's over there but in fact this is a
all<00:02:20.960> so<00:02:21.960> I'm<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:22.110> thinking<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.770> as<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.160> pot

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
all so I'm not thinking of it as a pot

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.490 
all so I'm not thinking of it as a pot
of<00:02:23.460> Karpis<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.300> yet<00:02:24.510> well<00:02:24.930> maybe<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.200> am<00:02:25.380> but

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
of Karpis just yet well maybe I am but

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
of Karpis just yet well maybe I am but
you<00:02:25.620> guys<00:02:25.770> don't<00:02:26.010> need<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.660> think

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you guys don't need to so you guys think

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.770 
you guys don't need to so you guys think
of<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.260> wall<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> start<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.940> put

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
of this as a wall so now I start to put

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.330 
of this as a wall so now I start to put
a<00:02:30.810> few<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.140> these<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.410> against<00:02:31.830> each<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
a few of these up against each other and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.000 
a few of these up against each other and
I've<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> blue<00:02:33.270> wall<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.710> pretty

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
I've got a blue wall and that's pretty

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 
I've got a blue wall and that's pretty
cool<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.610> I've<00:02:35.910> broken<00:02:36.150> up<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.450> my<00:02:36.570> plants

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
cool so I've broken up all my plants

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.380 
cool so I've broken up all my plants
into<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.200> number<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.530> shapes<00:02:37.800> first<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.460> plant

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
into a number of shapes first and plant

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.200 
into a number of shapes first and plant
names<00:02:39.630> later<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:41.970> going

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
names later on and I know that I'm going

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.970 
names later on and I know that I'm going
to<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.930> growing<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.410> plant<00:02:43.740> for

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to going to be growing that plant for

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.730 
to going to be growing that plant for
the<00:02:44.070> actual<00:02:44.370> habit<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> used<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.500> I'm

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
the actual habit that it is used to I'm

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.920 
the actual habit that it is used to I'm
not<00:02:47.250> enforcing<00:02:47.910> my<00:02:48.030> own<00:02:48.150> architecture<00:02:48.660> upon

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
not enforcing my own architecture upon

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.840 
not enforcing my own architecture upon
it<00:02:49.080> I'm<00:02:49.230> allowing<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.070> just<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.520> what<00:02:50.730> it

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
it I'm allowing it to just do what it

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.870 
it I'm allowing it to just do what it
does<00:02:51.110> ok<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.590> that's<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.070> secret<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.640> if

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
does ok and and that's the secret so if

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.510 
does ok and and that's the secret so if
I'm<00:02:54.270> if<00:02:54.480> I'm<00:02:54.630> growing<00:02:54.900> for<00:02:55.140> Stuka<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:56.340> stuco

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
I'm if I'm growing for Stuka for stuco

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.280 
I'm if I'm growing for Stuka for stuco
glauca<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.150> fantastic<00:02:57.600> plant<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.170> would

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
glauca is a fantastic plant that would

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.930 
glauca is a fantastic plant that would
own<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.950> middle<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.190> pavers<00:02:59.550> and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
own the in the middle of pavers and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.150 
own the in the middle of pavers and
things<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.960> plant<00:03:01.230> those<00:03:01.410> those<00:03:01.740> plants

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
things so I can plant those those plants

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.860 
things so I can plant those those plants
around<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> outside<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.000> pavers<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.480> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
around the outside of the pavers and I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.970 
around the outside of the pavers and I
know<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.230> I've<00:03:04.350> got<00:03:04.500> I'm<00:03:04.620> going<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:04.830> get<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
know that I've got I'm going to get a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.520 
know that I've got I'm going to get a
nice<00:03:05.220> dense<00:03:06.030> good<00:03:06.480> show<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.870> blue<00:03:07.080> color<00:03:07.350> on

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
nice dense good show of blue color on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.830 
nice dense good show of blue color on
picking<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.160> blue<00:03:08.400> that's<00:03:09.360> over<00:03:09.600> there<00:03:09.720> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
picking up the blue that's over there in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.930 
picking up the blue that's over there in
the<00:03:09.900> Prada<00:03:10.110> carpus<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.770> then<00:03:11.220> maybe<00:03:11.460> even<00:03:11.730> I'm

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the Prada carpus and then maybe even I'm

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.960 
the Prada carpus and then maybe even I'm
doing<00:03:12.510> my<00:03:12.600> calendar<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> flat<00:03:13.440> packs<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.070> and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
doing my calendar a flat packs and and

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.220 
doing my calendar a flat packs and and
that's<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.240> really<00:03:15.360> interesting<00:03:15.450> thing<00:03:16.050> too

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
that's a really interesting thing too

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.330 
that's a really interesting thing too
because<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.530> Reds<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.950> Blues<00:03:17.130> go

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
because the Reds and the Blues go

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.970 
because the Reds and the Blues go
together<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.970> wow<00:03:18.720> how<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> trick<00:03:19.560> myself<00:03:19.710> into

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
together so wow how to trick myself into

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.550 
together so wow how to trick myself into
designing<00:03:20.460> then<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.570> know<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.720> mean<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.440> I'm

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
designing then you know I mean and I'm

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.440 
designing then you know I mean and I'm
starting<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.010> use<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.490> plants<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.120> actually

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
starting to use the plants that actually

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.790 
starting to use the plants that actually
perform<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.990> tricks<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.470> want<00:03:25.710> it<00:03:25.770> to

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
perform the tricks that I want it to

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.950 
perform the tricks that I want it to
rather<00:03:26.670> than<00:03:26.970> enforcing<00:03:27.450> my<00:03:27.810> own

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
rather than enforcing my own

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.020 
rather than enforcing my own
