day liquid lipsticks I did half enough

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.930 
day liquid lipsticks I did half enough
stirring<00:04:28.800> today<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.160> compare<00:04:29.730> how<00:04:29.880> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
stirring today to compare how the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.690 
stirring today to compare how the
resisted<00:04:30.870> food<00:04:31.140> drink<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.740> water<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.610> have

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
resisted food drink in water and I have

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.490 
resisted food drink in water and I have
to<00:04:32.850> say<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.180> formula<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.600> extremely<00:04:34.230> similar

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
to say the formula is extremely similar

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.590 
to say the formula is extremely similar
they<00:04:35.070> go<00:04:35.250> on<00:04:35.400> pretty<00:04:35.730> thick<00:04:35.790> as<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.210> cream

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
they go on pretty thick as a cream

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.480 
they go on pretty thick as a cream
although<00:04:36.930> these<00:04:37.140> last<00:04:37.650> better<00:04:37.920> if<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.250> apply

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
although these last better if you apply

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.240 
although these last better if you apply
two<00:04:38.550> coats<00:04:38.810> when<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.230> drink<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.920> talk

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
two coats when you do drink and talk

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.100 
two coats when you do drink and talk
they<00:04:41.580> will<00:04:41.700> ask<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.360> up<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.720> six<00:04:42.960> hours

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
they will ask for like up to six hours

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.800 
they will ask for like up to six hours
but<00:04:43.860> when<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.100> start<00:04:44.370> eating<00:04:44.550> light<00:04:45.480> eating

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
but when you start eating light eating

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.570 
but when you start eating light eating
would<00:04:45.960> be<00:04:46.080> okay<00:04:46.380> but<00:04:46.560> if<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.800> eat<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.160> real<00:04:47.550> meal

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
would be okay but if you eat a real meal

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.640 
would be okay but if you eat a real meal
the<00:04:48.120> inside<00:04:48.510> will<00:04:48.780> disappear<00:04:49.230> which<00:04:49.440> is

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
the inside will disappear which is

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.470 
the inside will disappear which is
pretty<00:04:50.100> much<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.550> average<00:04:50.700> for<00:04:51.210> liquid

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
pretty much the average for liquid

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.870 
pretty much the average for liquid
lipsticks<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.200> couldn't<00:04:52.740> pinpoint<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.370> scent<00:04:53.670> of

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
these until a subscriber let me know

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.150 
these until a subscriber let me know
that<00:04:55.950> they<00:04:56.430> smell<00:04:56.760> like<00:04:57.000> mascara<00:04:57.480> which<00:04:58.160> kind

need to throw that mascara away like

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.090 
need to throw that mascara away like
it's<00:05:02.970> way<00:05:03.210> too<00:05:03.270> old<00:05:03.570> no<00:05:04.380> but<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.070> know

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
it's way too old no but just you know

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.040 
it's way too old no but just you know
freshly<00:05:05.670> open<00:05:06.060> smells<00:05:06.390> it<00:05:06.540> a<00:05:06.570> little<00:05:06.750> bit<00:05:06.900> like

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
freshly open smells it a little bit like

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.960 
freshly open smells it a little bit like
something<00:05:07.290> once<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.040> dries<00:05:08.250> down<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.550> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
something once it dries down to the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.820 
something once it dries down to the
matte<00:05:09.210> finish<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.900> don't<00:05:10.230> smell<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.560> at<00:05:10.710> all

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
matte finish you don't smell it at all

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.140 
matte finish you don't smell it at all
so<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.310> doesn't<00:05:11.610> matter<00:05:11.700> that<00:05:11.850> much

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
so it really doesn't matter that much

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210 
so it really doesn't matter that much
but<00:05:12.510> I<00:05:12.660> just<00:05:12.840> wanted<00:05:13.080> to<00:05:13.230> let<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.410> know<00:05:13.530> out<00:05:14.070> of
