00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
consistency for Sapir calling lobby or

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.880 
consistency for Sapir calling lobby or
dangering<00:02:29.690> or<00:02:30.490> sometimes<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.790> go<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.720> am<00:02:33.110> crazy

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
dangering or sometimes I go I am crazy

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.820 
dangering or sometimes I go I am crazy
and<00:02:34.280> even<00:02:34.700> superior<00:02:35.150> calling<00:02:35.690> Falcon<00:02:36.620> night

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
and even superior calling Falcon night

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.040 
and even superior calling Falcon night
for<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.640> extra<00:02:38.090> 2k<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:40.060> yeah<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.630> that's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
for that extra 2k and yeah so that's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.850 
for that extra 2k and yeah so that's
basically<00:02:42.170> my<00:02:42.620> Pellinore<00:02:43.550> deck<00:02:43.760> now<00:02:44.860> don't

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
basically my Pellinore deck now don't

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.920 
basically my Pellinore deck now don't
tell<00:02:46.010> anyone<00:02:46.490> about<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.450> secret<00:02:47.780> of

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
tell anyone about this but the secret of

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.370 
tell anyone about this but the secret of
this<00:02:48.050> deck<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.430> want<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> go<00:02:50.030> second<00:02:50.720> if

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
this deck is you want to go second if

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.550 
this deck is you want to go second if
you<00:02:51.650> win<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.980> dice<00:02:52.190> roll<00:02:52.490> and<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.750> go<00:02:54.110> you

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you win the dice roll and you go you

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.780 
you win the dice roll and you go you
pick<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.010> go<00:02:55.160> second<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:56.270> reason<00:02:56.660> why<00:02:56.840> because

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
pick to go second the reason why because

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.300 
pick to go second the reason why because
normally<00:02:58.790> if<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.040> only

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
normally if you you you can only

normally if you you you can only
superior<00:03:01.730> right<00:03:02.209> Pelin<00:03:02.810> or<00:03:02.990> if<00:03:03.230> opponents<00:03:04.220> are

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
superior right Pelin or if opponents are

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.810 
superior right Pelin or if opponents are
at<00:03:04.459> grade<00:03:04.820> 2<00:03:05.150> or<00:03:05.390> higher<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.400> only<00:03:07.550> way<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
at grade 2 or higher and the only way to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.900 
at grade 2 or higher and the only way to
do<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:09.050> early<00:03:09.620> game<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.100> if<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.790> have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
do that is on early game is if you have

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.810 
do that is on early game is if you have
great<00:03:11.209> one<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.870> they<00:03:12.080> already<00:03:12.560> ride<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.490> for

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
great one and they already ride it for

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.000 
great one and they already ride it for
great<00:03:14.000> too

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
great too

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.979 
great too
by<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.610> time<00:03:15.819> you're<00:03:16.000> right<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.510> grade<00:03:16.750> 2

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
by the time you're right for grade 2

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.920 
by the time you're right for grade 2
they're<00:03:17.379> already<00:03:17.590> at<00:03:17.890> grade<00:03:18.129> 2<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:18.690> if<00:03:19.690> they

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
they're already at grade 2 so if they

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.589 
they're already at grade 2 so if they
let<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.470> your<00:03:21.069> Vanguard<00:03:21.580> weight<00:03:21.790> or<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
let that your Vanguard weight or I

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.630 
let that your Vanguard weight or I
usually<00:03:23.019> put<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.379> behind<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.129> Vanguard

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
usually put this behind the Vanguard

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.320 
usually put this behind the Vanguard
because<00:03:25.569> if<00:03:25.900> they<00:03:26.290> let<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.920> pass<00:03:27.129> on<00:03:27.700> early

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
because if they let it pass on early

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.770 
because if they let it pass on early
usually<00:03:28.690> people<00:03:29.620> pass<00:03:30.220> all<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.120> attack<00:03:31.569> from

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
usually people pass all the attack from

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.350 
usually people pass all the attack from
the<00:03:31.930> Vanguard<00:03:32.349> early<00:03:32.650> game<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.099> if<00:03:33.879> I<00:03:34.000> managed

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
the Vanguard early game so if I managed

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.619 
the Vanguard early game so if I managed
to<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:35.410> managed<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:35.920> pass<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.489> have<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> random

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
to it managed to pass I have a random

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.890 
to it managed to pass I have a random
chance<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.250> righty<00:03:39.250> grade<00:03:39.580> 3<00:03:39.819> early<00:03:40.269> one<00:03:40.599> turn

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
chance of righty grade 3 early one turn

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.100 
chance of righty grade 3 early one turn
early<00:03:41.290> done<00:03:41.470> my<00:03:41.590> opponent

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
early done my opponent

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.010 
early done my opponent
yeah<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.440> yeah<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:45.520> only<00:03:45.670> time<00:03:45.970> I've<00:03:46.300> lost<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
yeah so yeah the only time I've lost to

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.770 
yeah so yeah the only time I've lost to
the<00:03:47.140> loss<00:03:47.770> with<00:03:48.100> this<00:03:48.280> deck<00:03:48.520> is<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.390> managed

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
the loss with this deck is if I managed

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.070 
the loss with this deck is if I managed
to<00:03:49.810> draw<00:03:50.230> two<00:03:50.710> to<00:03:50.980> three<00:03:51.420> actually<00:03:52.420> to

to draw two to three actually to

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.340 
to draw two to three actually to
Eleanor's<00:03:53.920> if<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.760> drew<00:03:54.970> if<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.660> draw<00:03:55.900> up<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.140> to

the hell him back in the day because

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.820 
the hell him back in the day because
because<00:04:14.030> if<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:14.990> spring<00:04:15.320> breeze<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
because if you have spring breeze and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.400 
because if you have spring breeze and
you're<00:04:16.040> going<00:04:16.340> second<00:04:16.850> there's<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.270> big<00:04:17.989> bigger

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
you're going second there's a big bigger

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.949 
you're going second there's a big bigger
chance<00:04:18.739> of<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.100> superior<00:04:19.550> writing<00:04:20.060> just<00:04:20.239> then

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
chance of you superior writing just then

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.680 
chance of you superior writing just then
having<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:22.100> normal<00:04:22.700> write<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.060> on<00:04:23.240> your<00:04:23.390> turn

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
having to normal write it on your turn

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.080 
having to normal write it on your turn
and<00:04:24.140> don't<00:04:24.950> worry<00:04:25.100> about<00:04:25.430> miss<00:04:25.640> rights<00:04:25.940> on

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
