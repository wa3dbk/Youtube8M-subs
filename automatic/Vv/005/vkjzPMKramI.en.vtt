00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
lot of time developing what we call

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.340 
lot of time developing what we call

light<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.560> paradox<00:03:04.950> coming<00:03:05.250> I've<00:03:05.820> been<00:03:06.090> told

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
light like paradox coming I've been told

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.180 
light like paradox coming I've been told
several<00:03:06.600> times<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.260> things<00:03:07.530> can't<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.890> done

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
several times that things can't be done

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.150 
several times that things can't be done
when<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> start<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.820> gamersgate<00:03:09.240> in<00:03:09.480> 2006<00:03:10.260> people

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
when I start a gamersgate in 2006 people

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.800 
when I start a gamersgate in 2006 people
told<00:03:11.400> me<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.850> market<00:03:12.150> was<00:03:12.239> totally<00:03:12.540> clogged

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
told me the market was totally clogged

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.780 
told me the market was totally clogged
on<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.340> not<00:03:14.489> room<00:03:14.730> for

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
on and that there was not room for

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.440 
on and that there was not room for
another<00:03:15.330> digital<00:03:16.200> distributor<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.420> here<00:03:18.420> we

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
another digital distributor and here we

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.440 
another digital distributor and here we
are<00:03:18.690> almost<00:03:18.989> five<00:03:19.320> years<00:03:19.500> later<00:03:19.910> proving<00:03:20.910> that

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
are almost five years later proving that

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.479 
are almost five years later proving that
we<00:03:21.660> actually<00:03:22.050> could<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.160> could

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
we actually could do it that we could

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.699 
we actually could do it that we could
build<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.090> new<00:03:24.300> digital<00:03:24.720> distribution<00:03:24.989> channel

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
build a new digital distribution channel

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.440 
build a new digital distribution channel
and<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.160> we<00:03:26.340> actually<00:03:26.519> could<00:03:26.940> make<00:03:27.150> money

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
and that we actually could make money

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.960 
and that we actually could make money
from<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.810> so<00:03:29.030> maybe<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.570> getting<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.590> bit

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
from it so maybe I'm getting a bit

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.560 
from it so maybe I'm getting a bit
overconfident<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.600> I'm<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:36.060> confident

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
overconfident but I'm pretty confident

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.509 
overconfident but I'm pretty confident
that<00:03:36.660> we<00:03:37.320> can<00:03:37.530> succeed<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> free-to-play

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
that we can succeed in the free-to-play

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.490 
that we can succeed in the free-to-play
arena<00:03:38.940> as<00:03:39.120> well<00:03:39.180> I'm<00:03:39.930> not<00:03:40.140> saying<00:03:40.440> that

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
arena as well I'm not saying that

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.020 
arena as well I'm not saying that
everything<00:03:40.890> would<00:03:41.130> do<00:03:41.340> should<00:03:41.640> go<00:03:41.820> into

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
everything would do should go into

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.330 
everything would do should go into
free-to-play<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:42.959> very<00:03:43.340> important

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
free-to-play and that's very important

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.740 
free-to-play and that's very important
to<00:03:44.370> remember<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:44.880> well<00:03:45.000> our<00:03:45.300> bread<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.570> butter

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
