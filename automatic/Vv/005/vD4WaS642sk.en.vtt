00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello everyone and today we will learn 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.630
 song of the king and the jester 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:13.440
 jumped off a cliff I think the song is not really 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 difficult therefore to disassemble anything here I 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.980
 just in slow action his my 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.029
 I will play and you will see what chords on 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 what words are rearranged and probably 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 it will be all the analysis and plus at the end 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 show what chords for beginners 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.809
 can replace 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 in this song we look at the voice without paying 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:48.920
 attention 5 I did not know how to learn already 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.920
 filed so effort 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 I 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.920
 Completly not 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.150
 I know here 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 we are nothing 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.610
 of life 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.930
 Well 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.930
 and now 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 So what 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.820
 fled to 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.330
 and 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.260
 and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.150
 music 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.430
 dreams 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 how is my god there 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.610
 he and 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:04.510
 that's the whole song is easy and simple 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.510
 fight here in a verse 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.090
 i wanted 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.380
 but 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380
 we 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:30.270
 it's not up to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.360
 I know nobody 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.360
 not 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.400
 and now i have one blue 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:03:03.670
 my simple chorus of course 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:14.280
 it's better to play like that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:19.100
 here she is 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:26.670
 look you appeared 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:31.040
 Well, something like this and now for the most 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:37.040
 beginners will show how you can replace 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:40.760
 for example here's a chord on bars 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.280
 if someone can't take it so far 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.769
 you can just take three strings on 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.739
 third fret 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.739
 Well, so squeezed and when here we play howl 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.680
 we drink on the lower strings without catching 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.720
 the top of such a nicke 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.560
 I think no one will die from this song 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.850
 will sound 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:14.840
 and nothing wrong with that 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:17.430
 and a chord here is this one 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.940
 can replace with 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.940
 who is more familiar here already 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:34.550
 little finger on the third fret on the first string 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.550
 but on top here are these two chic 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:43.970
 that's all well from the chords are not going anywhere 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.970
 he go his curly 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.009
 well basically that's the whole song all good luck 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.449
