00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.339
 nice guys here sector that talks to you is 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.589
 Today I came back with this new one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.330
 commit on black ops two like us 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.190
 I anticipated I bring you my first 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 video concerning the new dlc titled 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
 revolution and it is composed of four 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.310
 new maps or downhill hydro 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 mirages and finally great over short one 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.300
 depending on how you want to pronounce it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 that the one you are seeing this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.350
 moment for me I have to say 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 that I was satisfied with all this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.269
 since the maps are well made with many 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 details, in their turn, are therefore treated 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 from this point of view I can not 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 say nothing while regarding 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.469
 the level of playability 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.270
 I can tell you that I have enough factor 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.219
 critical as people tend to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 live in a hallucinatory way but 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 most shocking is that sports 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.520
 this girls are really bad 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.079
 pro was the only flaw I have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 detected for found in this arc 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.410
 of time but all in all we say that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 have done a job we say good if 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 were it not for these spawns 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 random here is this of course though 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.270
 in all as this expansion 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 or franchises 9 of a new map for 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.409
 regarding the zombie mode of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 a new way but above all things 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 most important that I think pushed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 market players to buy this 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.909
 new dlc was the introduction of a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 new weapon that until now was not 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.110
 never checked in a call of duty and i'm 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 referring to the peacemaker pleasure 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.799
 that for what concerns you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 belongs to the category of 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.460
 machine guns even if compared to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.170
 others just a little slower and 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 let's say I would have parried it more to one 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.479
 assault rifle tests well that these 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.700
 I can tell you details about it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.229
 it's discreet good weapon as the weapon 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.909
 let's say it's not all that end of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.799
 world there are better weapons than 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 that then of course this is mine 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.790
 point of view that you can share or 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 less and therefore nothing after having redone 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.930
 in short, a brief summary of this map 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 pack I introduce the game in 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.810
 question in which I will succeed 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 call a swarm nothing 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.229
 exorbitant for or with ma 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.000
 reiterated earlier do good 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.399
 performance especially at the beginning here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.020
 turns out to be really complicated for the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.790
 simple fact that people tend to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.570
 move little or f said in words 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.770
 poor tends to live here and then 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.750
 in short, returning we were saying that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 this is the fee or swarm 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.940
 as well as to those dogs after the last patch 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 which came into force 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.270
 a few days ago they became non- di 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.190
 co2 rewards scars because there 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.840
 however, they would have fallen 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.700
 their number decisions because anyway 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.170
 the even day side I was playing 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.870
 on the map turbines at war through 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.210
 where usually when you keep a salle 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.520
 add a 20 a 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.260
 30 of kits do it while even me 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.450
 ne me has only made 12 roche 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
 count on the mind 12 facts we say that 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 I was a little surprised because 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.760
 anyway with all the problems that we 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.140
 players we have found or the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.850
 problem of cinema the problem of 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.470
 connection that let's face it a lot 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.450
 honestly it's not that they did 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.800
 who knows what to improve it 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.300
 they go to think of rather 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 reward or weaken the 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.690
 weapons how can it be a pdv that was 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.820
 reportedly that it has been weakened 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.160
 even though playing this is me anyway 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.010
 what I said very sincerely is not me 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 then it seemed naturally if you know 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.470
 if you have any news, see the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.940
 arms updates write to me here 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.290
 below in the comments that I now don't 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.020
 I am more than informed in that 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.030
 which is this peace or in 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.560
 that renata change or not though 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.880
 I can tell you then the connection 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.170
 to get you concerned it's worse 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
 especially with regards to the 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.910
 playstation 3 that I can tell you that the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.410
 Host migration is incredible you emigrate 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.370
 lot 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.320
 which, however, was not the case before 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.750
 also check on xbox it anyway 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.280
 there begin to be some of the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.620
 falls I do not know what it is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.510
 think of you notes as always invite a

 also in loading this commit pre 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.820
 let's say I come from a few days a 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.290
 little ups and downs because they had anyway 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.269
 a hallucinated heartache even now 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 anyway heaven still operates 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.690
 trying to get it through and I have to find 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.010
