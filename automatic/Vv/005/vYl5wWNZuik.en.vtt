my core 0 sensors come back to life I'm

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.679 
my core 0 sensors come back to life I'm
very<00:01:10.729> happy<00:01:12.009> that's<00:01:13.009> our<00:01:13.130> temperatures<00:01:13.700> I

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
very happy that's our temperatures I

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.020 
very happy that's our temperatures I
they<00:01:15.439> are<00:01:15.590> about<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.009> degree<00:01:16.430> or<00:01:16.549> two<00:01:16.610> higher

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
they are about a degree or two higher

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.429 
they are about a degree or two higher
than<00:01:17.360> what<00:01:17.479> they<00:01:17.600> were<00:01:17.659> i<00:01:17.780> raised<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
than what they were i raised the

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.960 
than what they were i raised the
temperature<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.979> my<00:01:19.070> room<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:19.520> up<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.759> what<00:01:19.789> I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
temperature in my room it's up to what I

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.029 
temperature in my room it's up to what I
think<00:01:20.149> 72<00:01:20.689> right<00:01:20.960> now<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:21.729> was<00:01:22.869> 70<00:01:24.039> surprised

think 72 right now and was 70 surprised

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:42.190 
think 72 right now and was 70 surprised
71<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.030> case<00:01:26.240> give<00:01:26.630> or<00:01:26.780> take

not a bit too soon to be hitting 4
gigahertz<00:01:50.750> I'm<00:01:51.750> about<00:01:52.080> one<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.650> notch<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
gigahertz I'm about one more notch and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.660 
gigahertz I'm about one more notch and
I'm<00:01:53.400> at<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> max<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.570> run<00:01:54.780> 24<00:01:55.590> 7<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.340> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I'm at the max that I can run 24 7 so I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.590 
I'm at the max that I can run 24 7 so I
tried<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> push<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.080> 40<00:01:58.549> because<00:01:59.549> 40<00:02:00.030> 50<00:02:00.450> or

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
tried to push it to 40 because 40 50 or

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.770 
tried to push it to 40 because 40 50 or
four<00:02:00.930> point<00:02:01.200> oh<00:02:01.290> five<00:02:01.560> at<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> same<00:02:02.939> specs<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
four point oh five at the same specs and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.800 
four point oh five at the same specs and

this<00:02:35.740> is<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.790> see<00:02:37.290> small<00:02:38.290> FFTs

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
this is you can see small FFTs

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
set on priority one because really I've

think it matters what priority it's on

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.860 
think it matters what priority it's on
it<00:02:49.600> seems<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.110> higher<00:02:50.290> priority<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.870> if

it seems like the higher priority and if
you<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.320> on<00:02:53.410> large<00:02:54.160> FFTs<00:02:54.880> which<00:02:55.150> goes<00:02:55.390> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
you want it on large FFTs which goes and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.230 
you want it on large FFTs which goes and
stresses<00:02:56.110> some<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.320> your<00:02:56.440> RAM<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:58.090> will

stresses some of your RAM to that will

stresses some of your RAM to that will
actually<00:02:58.390> push<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.900> harder<00:02:59.550> but<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.510> said

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
actually push it harder but like I said

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.330 
actually push it harder but like I said
it's<00:03:01.990> been<00:03:02.170> running<00:03:02.410> for<00:03:02.530> almost<00:03:02.920> 20<00:03:03.310> hours

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
it's been running for almost 20 hours

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.670 
it's been running for almost 20 hours
and<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.540> never<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.050> see<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.410> kind<00:03:05.590> of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and it's never going to see this kind of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.460 
and it's never going to see this kind of
load<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:07.390> about<00:03:07.510> good<00:03:07.840> enough<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.380> to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
load so it's about good enough I got to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.870 
load so it's about good enough I got to
get<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.650> phone<00:03:08.860> sorry<00:03:09.490> for<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.700> interruption

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
get the phone sorry for the interruption

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.020 
get the phone sorry for the interruption
guys<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.690> guys<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.080> great<00:03:11.260> day<00:03:11.560> and
