00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
I just had to do my kind of take on it

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.169 
I just had to do my kind of take on it
because<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:10.980> fun<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:11.519> girly<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
because it's just so fun so girly and

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.749 
because it's just so fun so girly and
just<00:00:12.509> really<00:00:12.780> kind<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.080> nice<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.799> it's<00:00:14.549> not

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
just really kind of nice and it's not

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.609 
just really kind of nice and it's not
too<00:00:14.969> crazy<00:00:15.210> even<00:00:15.540> though<00:00:15.809> Shu<00:00:16.020> she<00:00:16.260> does<00:00:16.470> go

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
too crazy even though Shu she does go

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.320 
too crazy even though Shu she does go
over<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.949> top<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.160> her<00:00:17.340> makeup<00:00:17.640> but<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.150> not

over the top of her makeup but it's not

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
over the top of her makeup but it's not
too<00:00:18.510> bad<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.289> thought<00:00:19.800> I'd<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.039> something

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
