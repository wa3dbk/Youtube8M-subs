second one is one that I really like
using<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.710> faster<00:01:20.250> grooves<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
using with faster grooves it's just a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.899 
using with faster grooves it's just a
snare<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> series<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> bass<00:01:23.250> drum

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
hits on the off beat to beat fill so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
hits on the off beat to beat fill so
stubborn<00:01:26.820> beats<00:01:27.000> free<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.600> move<00:01:28.200> our<00:01:28.380> way

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
as I said I like playing this one a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.120 
as I said I like playing this one a
little<00:02:08.240> bit<00:02:08.420> faster<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.320> here<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.740> are<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:10.100> a

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
little bit faster so here we are at a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:24.070 
little bit faster so here we are at a
bit<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.429> higher<00:02:10.610> tempo<00:02:11.120> one<00:02:12.050> two<00:02:23.050> okay<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
bit of a higher tempo one two okay a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.750 
bit of a higher tempo one two okay a
little<00:02:24.380> bit<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.560> fun<00:02:24.709> there<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.160> now<00:02:25.610> this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
last one involves that little double

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
last one involves that little double
stroke<00:02:28.370> finger<00:02:28.760> roll<00:02:28.940> technique<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.570> talked

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
stroke finger roll technique I talked

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.130 
stroke finger roll technique I talked
about<00:02:30.050> occasionally<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:31.340> know<00:02:31.459> that<00:02:35.140> that

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
about occasionally you know that that

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.610 
about occasionally you know that that
one

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
one

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.800 
one
I<00:02:36.650> might<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.550> play<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.000> one<00:02:38.209> first<00:02:38.540> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
I might just play this one first and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:52.990 
I might just play this one first and
then<00:02:38.989> explain<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.470> second<00:02:40.070> one<00:02:40.640> two<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.940> we'll

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
then explain it second one two so we'll

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.550 
then explain it second one two so we'll
start<00:02:53.299> off<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.600> little<00:02:53.690> snitch<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.350> to

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
another one of those to beat fills so we

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.850 
another one of those to beat fills so we
start<00:03:07.850> at<00:03:07.940> three<00:03:08.269> we<00:03:08.510> work<00:03:08.750> our<00:03:08.959> way<00:03:09.140> into<00:03:09.440> one
