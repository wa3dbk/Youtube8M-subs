00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.740 

got<00:00:56.940> myself<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.719> these<00:00:58.879> Chinese<00:00:59.879> copycat

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
got myself one of these Chinese copycat

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.580 
got myself one of these Chinese copycat
on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.320> clone<00:01:01.590> motors<00:01:03.890> runs<00:01:04.890> great<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.470> not

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
on the clone motors runs great it's not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.289 
on the clone motors runs great it's not
quite<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.189> shape<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.490> size<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.030> fit<00:01:09.210> in

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
quite the right shape and size to fit in

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.530 
quite the right shape and size to fit in
there<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.670> always<00:01:11.670> believe<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.420> do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
there but I always believe I can do

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480 
there but I always believe I can do
anything<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.070> what's<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
anything so let's see what's going to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
anything so let's see what's going to
happen

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.560 

probably<00:01:38.920> burn<00:01:39.070> less<00:01:39.310> gas<00:01:39.640> -<00:01:39.940> it's<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.240> lot<00:01:40.390> less

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
probably burn less gas - it's a lot less

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.030 
probably burn less gas - it's a lot less
CCS<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:41.470> got<00:01:42.540> overhead<00:01:43.540> valves<00:01:44.050> let's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
CCS and it's got overhead valves let's

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.490 
CCS and it's got overhead valves let's
see<00:01:45.280> what<00:01:45.430> I<00:01:45.460> can<00:01:45.700> do<00:01:48.870> well<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:50.080> fits<00:01:50.320> into

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
see what I can do well it fits into

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.450 
see what I can do well it fits into
space<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.510> little<00:01:52.750> tight<00:01:52.960> for<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.320> Oilers

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.710 

really<00:01:57.460> not<00:01:57.640> much<00:01:57.850> clearance<00:01:58.180> there<00:01:58.450> I<00:01:58.480> might

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
really not much clearance there I might

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.090 
really not much clearance there I might
have<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.050> not<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.890> motor<00:02:00.100> mount<00:02:00.310> plate<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:03.040> I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
have to not the motor mount plate now I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.890 
have to not the motor mount plate now I
got<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.120> drive<00:02:04.360> pulley<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.870> one<00:02:05.710> part<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
got the drive pulley on one part of it

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.430 
got the drive pulley on one part of it
there's<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.140> other<00:02:08.260> part<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.710> it<00:02:09.899> I've<00:02:10.899> now

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
there's the other part of it I've now

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.880 
there's the other part of it I've now
got<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:12.390> measure<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.720> position<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.620> where

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
got to measure the position here where

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.140 
got to measure the position here where
it<00:02:15.010> lines<00:02:15.190> up<00:02:15.460> I've<00:02:15.670> already<00:02:15.940> pre-measured

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it lines up I've already pre-measured

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.990 
it lines up I've already pre-measured
that<00:02:16.570> with<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.810> old<00:02:16.990> motor

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that with the old motor

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.660 
that with the old motor
it's<00:02:19.000> quarter<00:02:19.450> inch<00:02:19.660> higher<00:02:20.370> than<00:02:21.370> that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
it's quarter inch higher than that

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
it's quarter inch higher than that
piece-of-crap<00:02:22.150> Kohler<00:02:22.990> motor<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.740> next<00:02:26.740> step

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
piece-of-crap Kohler motor so next step

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.870 
piece-of-crap Kohler motor so next step
is<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.430> find<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.480> location<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> hopefully<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.790> can

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
is to find a location so hopefully I can

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.520 
is to find a location so hopefully I can
use<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.300> same<00:02:31.480> belts<00:02:33.300> well<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.990> modifying

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
use the same belts well just modifying

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.900 
use the same belts well just modifying
the<00:02:35.680> motor<00:02:35.860> mount<00:02:36.100> base<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:38.459> oily<00:02:39.459> wet<00:02:39.640> grass

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
the motor mount base and oily wet grass

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.250 
the motor mount base and oily wet grass
makes<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.450> good<00:02:40.600> fire<00:02:42.870> clearance<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.989> put<00:02:44.170> oil

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
makes a good fire clearance to put oil

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.199 
makes a good fire clearance to put oil
in<00:02:44.590> clearance<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.640> oil<00:02:45.820> out<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:48.030> course<00:02:49.030> in

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
in clearance to get oil out of course in

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.460 
in clearance to get oil out of course in
this<00:02:49.330> world<00:02:49.570> not<00:02:49.810> everything<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.410> easy<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:52.470> just

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
this world not everything is easy I just

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.930 
this world not everything is easy I just
got<00:02:53.680> done<00:02:53.920> welding<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.489> some<00:02:54.790> little

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
got done welding on some little

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.790 
got done welding on some little
extension<00:02:55.570> plates<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> motor<00:02:56.380> mounts

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
extension plates for the motor mounts

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.690 
extension plates for the motor mounts
because<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.400> course<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.330> motor<00:02:58.510> didn't<00:02:58.870> fit

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
because of course the motor didn't fit

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.220 
because of course the motor didn't fit
new<00:03:00.700> hole<00:03:00.940> there<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.239> new<00:03:01.480> hole<00:03:01.750> there<00:03:01.989> I've<00:03:02.200> got
