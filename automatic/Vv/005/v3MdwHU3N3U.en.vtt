00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.160 

the<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.719> we're<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> talk

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the first thing we're going to talk

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.129 
the first thing we're going to talk
about<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.530> integers<00:00:14.839> when<00:00:15.839> you're<00:00:15.960> adding

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
about is integers when you're adding

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.800 
about is integers when you're adding
integers<00:00:16.529> two<00:00:16.949> things<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.400> occur<00:00:17.660> when<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
integers two things can occur when the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.720 
integers two things can occur when the
signs<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> same<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.580> add

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
signs are the same you're going to add

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660 
signs are the same you're going to add
the<00:00:20.939> numbers<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> keep<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> same<00:00:22.170> sign<00:00:22.670> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the numbers and keep the same sign so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.580 
the numbers and keep the same sign so
negative<00:00:24.119> 12<00:00:24.330> plus<00:00:24.420> negative<00:00:24.750> 13<00:00:25.289> means

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
negative 12 plus negative 13 means

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
negative 12 plus negative 13 means
you're<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.130> add<00:00:26.340> your<00:00:26.609> numbers<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.170> get

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you're going to add your numbers to get

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
you're going to add your numbers to get
25<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.099> since<00:00:29.820> they're<00:00:29.939> both<00:00:30.060> negative<00:00:30.269> our

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
25 and since they're both negative our

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.889 
25 and since they're both negative our
answer<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.109> negative<00:00:32.360> when<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> signs<00:00:33.719> are

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
answer is negative when the signs are

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.569 
answer is negative when the signs are
different<00:00:33.950> you're<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.190> find<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
different you're going to find the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
different you're going to find the
difference<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> absolute<00:00:36.600> values<00:00:37.020> then

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
difference of the absolute values then

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.650 
difference of the absolute values then
take<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> sign<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> number<00:00:39.120> with<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
take the sign of the number with the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.799 
take the sign of the number with the
higher<00:00:39.870> absolute<00:00:40.320> value<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.390> absolute

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
higher absolute value so the absolute

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.910 
higher absolute value so the absolute
value<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> negative<00:00:43.410> 19<00:00:44.010> will<00:00:44.670> be<00:00:44.789> 19<00:00:45.920> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
value of negative 19 will be 19 the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
value of negative 19 will be 19 the
absolute<00:00:47.280> value<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> 8<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.059> 8<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.719> you're

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
absolute value of 8 would be 8 so you're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
absolute value of 8 would be 8 so you're
going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> subtract<00:00:50.160> those<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.610> numbers<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
going to subtract those two numbers to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.010 
going to subtract those two numbers to
get<00:00:51.870> 11<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.149> this<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.360> has<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.809> higher

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
get 11 and this one has the higher

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350 
get 11 and this one has the higher
absolute<00:00:55.680> value<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> take

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
absolute value so you're going to take

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
absolute value so you're going to take
the<00:00:57.719> negative<00:00:58.170> sign<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.280> negative<00:00:59.730> 19<00:01:00.120> plus<00:01:00.390> 8

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the negative sign so negative 19 plus 8

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.729 
the negative sign so negative 19 plus 8
is<00:01:00.750> negative<00:01:00.960> 11<00:01:03.379> subtraction<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.470> want<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
is negative 11 subtraction we want to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.030 
is negative 11 subtraction we want to
change<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.430> adding<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> opposite<00:01:07.040> then

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
change to adding the opposite then

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.640 
change to adding the opposite then
follow<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> rules<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.850> addition<00:01:09.650> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
follow the rules for addition so

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.609 
follow the rules for addition so
negative<00:01:11.189> 22<00:01:11.640> minus<00:01:12.000> 7<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.869> re-written<00:01:13.200> as

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
negative 22 minus 7 can be re-written as

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
negative 22 minus 7 can be re-written as
negative<00:01:14.430> 22<00:01:15.590> plus<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.920> negative<00:01:17.729> 7<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.630> first

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
negative 22 plus a negative 7 our first

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.690 
negative 22 plus a negative 7 our first
number<00:01:19.710> stays<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> same

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
number stays the same

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.340 
number stays the same
we<00:01:21.060> change<00:01:21.390> our<00:01:21.570> subtraction<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.320> addition

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
we change our subtraction to addition

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.550 
we change our subtraction to addition
and<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.490> take<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> opposite<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.630> positive<00:01:25.229> 7

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and we take the opposite of a positive 7

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.010 
and we take the opposite of a positive 7
which<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> negative<00:01:26.369> 7

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
which is a negative 7

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
which is a negative 7
now<00:01:28.020> since<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> signs<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.430> more

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
now since the signs are the same or more

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
now since the signs are the same or more
adding<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.509> add<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.869> together<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.950> get

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
adding we add them together and we get

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
adding we add them together and we get
negative<00:01:32.250> 29<00:01:34.369> negative<00:01:35.369> 14<00:01:35.790> minus<00:01:35.820> negative

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
negative 29 negative 14 minus negative

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.370 
negative 29 negative 14 minus negative
10<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.650> same<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:38.189> as<00:01:38.310> negative<00:01:38.490> 14

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
10 is the same thing as negative 14

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
10 is the same thing as negative 14
change<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> subtraction<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.310> addition<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
change the subtraction to addition and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
change the subtraction to addition and
the<00:01:42.540> opposite<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> negative<00:01:43.439> 10<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the opposite of negative 10 is a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.660 
the opposite of negative 10 is a
positive<00:01:44.310> 10<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:47.280> adding<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
positive 10 so now we're adding the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850 
positive 10 so now we're adding the
signs<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.689> we're<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> find

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
signs are different we're going to find

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.770 
signs are different we're going to find
the<00:01:50.009> difference<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> difference<00:01:51.360> between

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the difference so the difference between

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.600 
the difference so the difference between
14<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> 10<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.280> 4<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:55.290> negative<00:01:55.470> 14<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
14 and 10 is 4 and the negative 14 that

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
14 and 10 is 4 and the negative 14 that
has<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> higher<00:01:57.270> absolute<00:01:57.780> value<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.189> our

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
has the higher absolute value so our

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.499 
has the higher absolute value so our
answer<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.700> negative<00:02:01.729> when<00:02:02.729> multiplying<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
answer is negative when multiplying and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.520 
answer is negative when multiplying and
dividing<00:02:03.649> if<00:02:04.820> we<00:02:05.820> have<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.840> integers<00:02:07.140> with

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
dividing if we have two integers with

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
dividing if we have two integers with
the<00:02:07.560> same<00:02:07.680> sign<00:02:08.330> whether<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> positive

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the same sign whether it's a positive

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.479 
the same sign whether it's a positive
and<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> positive<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.890> negative<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.400> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and a positive or negative and a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.670 
and a positive or negative and a
negative<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:12.420> gives<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> positive<00:02:12.930> answer

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
negative it gives you a positive answer

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.339 
negative it gives you a positive answer
if<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.579> have<00:02:14.730> different<00:02:15.060> signs<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.989> gives<00:02:16.230> you

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
if you have different signs it gives you

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.949 
if you have different signs it gives you
a<00:02:16.379> negative<00:02:16.560> answer<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.150> negative<00:02:18.659> 8<00:02:18.750> times

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
