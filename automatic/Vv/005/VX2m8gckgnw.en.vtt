 I'm going to show you a request from the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.929
 subscriber or from several subscribers the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.820
 I'm really going to talk to you with him and you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.970
 I'm going to talk about my experience with the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 next to which the extra does not get 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 this is a system of care of 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 easy cleaning ie it is a brush in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.800
 this vibratory case of facial care 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800
 facial cleaning 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.190
 ah 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.470
 I bought in makeup to the web here 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.510
 I already bought this one, not to take him out 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.770
 there was another one that is the normal hexa that is 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.360
 of the rotating head 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.460
 the next a light that is the new one of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.040
 head the vibrator I took the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.110
 vibrating head because I do not know the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.690
 I really do not have one because I do not have 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.280
 one reason but it was new I said for six 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 new that will be more advanced 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.100
 I'll teach it that way too 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.750
 this is the box a box in the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.750
 channels explained and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 comes all late when I play here that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:21.520
 this is empty with information closure 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.049
 informative product the article is 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.110
 this the product as we should call it 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.549
 is this with your good foot I leave it is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 even a little bit of his last challenge in 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.409
 the bathroom and the dust and that is why 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.780
 accumulate this is to place it in the 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.790
 bathroom just like that and I always have a place 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.880
 the cleaning head because it 's the most 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.320
 what he 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.350
 the brush listen to it 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.440
 has a vibration head note 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.360
 he only lives and what I'm doing are 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.640
 circles when I clean my face 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.570
 in circles but it would not be necessary 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 do many circles because the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.460
 heads here so easy again that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 they are easy to remove 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.979
 I said well I can not believe what 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.360
 the dog has come with a doll that 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.730
 it makes more noise than anything in the world 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.129
 it looks like it says now that it's recording 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.030
 the noise that can so we do not have 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.280
 subject 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 this is the cleaning head or upload 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.350
 explaining a little what they are although I 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 I think there is a video, I do not know what 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.470
 I explain when I bought it but 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.920
 I want to explain a little more to me 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.920
 opinion 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.720
 to see if I find 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.470
 Well this is normal facial brushing 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.470
 the cleaning brush can you 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.900
 I hope it stays well 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.209
 it is this that is the one that I used 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.459
 It contains a cleaning brush this 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.370
 is much more finite that stabilizes my 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.690
 boyfriend when when he used it a 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.160
 every 15 years 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.160
 Moderation will continue 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.470
 louis who has 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 to 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.300
 which is what I used next to 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.450
 student because he helped me a little bit 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.450
 plus 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.610
 contains a brush or a head 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.170
 massage that I am used once 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.140
 just for trying it the first day that 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.909
 use all to try it but good what 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.540
 of the massage the truth remaining with less 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.150
 that nothing so much time for a lot of massage 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.780
 and then it contains a sponge that is with 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.250
 which apply on the table 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.190
 moisturizing is this sponge 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.260
 then explained I have used all 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.730
 the test heads all except the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.590
 of sensitive skin that is good you have 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.340
 I say we use it and then these 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.170
 two as there is no difference I 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.820
 I use cream with cream in this 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.200
 moment I start with cream because my 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.870
 priority was to spend the cleansing cream 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.730
 as not only use cleansing creams 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.850
 was my priority then used with 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.410
 cream me the first forgiveness happens to me 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.880
 the washcloth I always take off the excess 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.610
 of makeup with a washcloth and then 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.030
 I already clean the district cream 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.459
 and all over the face and then with a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.169
 cotton the withdrawal with micellar water me what 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.280
 I take it all out again, I leave my skin 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.280
 always unpolluted 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.020
 this is paradise what I tell you 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.390
 exfoliant I will use it sometime then 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.710
 is a head clean little more 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.470
 depth because the bristles are more 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.900
 strong and the cream applicator is not 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.480
 use because I think it took me 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.240
 a lot in applying the cream and absorbs 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.030
 too much the product 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.560
 and the massage what I told you not to 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.479
 I usually have a lot of time to give myself 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.849
 massage my opinion 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.130
 let's see my personal opinion is that 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.650
 is an article that is worth it that I do 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.919
 I have used enough that you have the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.900
 very clean skin but I who test me 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.660
 always the lack of time for me this 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.240
 it's a little waste of time since I 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.539
 I wipe the face with the wipe me 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.050
 clean with micellar water I'm gone 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:15.550
 the wipe micellar water applied me the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.370
 eye contour cream and you're done 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.500
 then here add a year glass of the step 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.630
 of the cleansing cream then I what 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.870
 I use almost more when I touch my skin 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.400
 it's a bit more muted plus the fast and 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.770
 so to use every day 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.090
 I'm vague for it so I use 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.460
 what I tell you when the skin a little 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.199
 more subdued or I look worse or I'm very 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.770
 make-up and say I 'm going to clean well 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.080
 okay or when I get these damn 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.990
 grains that have left me like that a couple of 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.650
 granites that I do not understand because that 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.820
 then it's worth it 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:53.260
 Let's see 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.880
 and I think it's worth it 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.760
 if you want a cleaning more in 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.890
 depth as a complement to the 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.440
 Daily cleaning is worth it for 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.420
 do it once a day that deserves the 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.850
 sorry if you have time to clean them the 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.530
 skin is not an exaggerated price is not a 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.560
 historical clark that you're worth hundred do not know 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.230
 How many euros or one foral diner? 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.180
 that is also worth a grass I do not 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.010
 spend on those items I 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.810
 already discovered the use that I am going to give it 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.900
 then I would not spend my priority 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.600
 was to buy this first to see if I 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.000
 would use and if I saw that it's the glen 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.920
 from Spain I would spend more money but 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.530
 How does he not drink? 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.850
 pump or mishima no part stays skin very 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:39.190
 clean and very very purified 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.900
 then it's worth it for that 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.820
 so that to buy it for cleaning 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.639
 I do not know if you have clarified much with my 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.410
 opinion at this time you would buy not 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.300
 you would buy it I would still buy it 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.580
 because sometimes you see the skin off you 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.169
 you spend you clean well well well and you 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.090
 it stays the color of the skin changes 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.180
 so, yes, I would go back to 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.220
 buy back then it's already in a matter of 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.070
 priorities if you want to buy the 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.470
 clark and sonic or the moon folio and such 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.690
 I would not invest it, I'm telling you seriously 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.940
 there it would not invest the price of 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.039
 this is usually thirty euros in 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.690
 make up what I tell you but I 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:18.690
 logical a promotion that was nothing more 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.510
 launch what was 15 to 15 euros me 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.340
 it looks like he's retired he went out that way 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.020
 price I'll buy it again 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.310
 for 30 I would also have bought the only 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.220
 that I was waiting a lot because 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.310
 I was exhausted and nothing because this is what 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.620
 What can I tell you about 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.940
 about the connection that right now I'm going to 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.520
 use to remove makeup 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.340
 makeup I stop to record because 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.780
 I have mud on my face, I do not know why 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.280
 what this makeup darkens me 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.340
 I usually use to record 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.070
 because I usually see more clearly 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.680
 and that little else I can tell is that I do not know 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.570
 what else to tell you I think it's all 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.570
 said does not have much more to tell you a 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:58.190
 I catch you vibrating facial cleansing 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.510
 cleans the skin very well leaves you very 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.340
 luminous the skin 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.530
 If you want to try, I'll tell you that my 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.880
 opinion is positive so I do not expect anything 

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.530
 that you liked the video and about 

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.890
 all serve and that we see the following 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.890
 graduated
