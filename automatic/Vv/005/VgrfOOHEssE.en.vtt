00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.500
 Hello everyone, sapan sir 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.890
 and today a video about the Soviet hard 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.939
 KV-1 with rather well is not 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.640
 patches 093 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.320
 and it has become a well on the test server 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.960
 let's start with the fact that now 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.750
 called apt-1c is a tank of the fifth level 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.940
 and as the name suggests it 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.379
 really now just as a matter of fact 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.809
 saying lite calla 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.540
 that is, we have one such heavy 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.579
 fifth level and there is a square-1c is such 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.300
 sporty but actually there 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.789
 speed option to leschke it a little worse 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.070
 armored but it is noticeably faster 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.230
 the gun is exactly the same that is there 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.949
 85 mm guns that are on 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.160
 KV-1 and 122 mm gun she 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.620
 absolutely analogous to the landfill y-11 I 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.239
 I tried a little here on it 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.030
 ride with cumulative land mines 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.460
 Well, in general, the impressions are not the most pleasant 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.250
 that is, of course, a fugaby pretty 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.440
 Spit does not really hit the battery penetration 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.959
 place 40 millimeters just well and they 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.429
 certainly quite expensive and 85 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:21.860
 meters of guns too absolutely 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.289
 standard overall this tank has now become 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.349
 absolutely so ordinary he 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.080
 absolutely normal that is so slightly 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.599
 light square-1 but noticeably 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.270
 quickly but I want to tell you 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:39.020
 mostly not about him and that now on 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.759
 sixth level with former class and now 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.920
 already tank kV-85 in general as it follows from 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.459
 titles and how i would for example wait around 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.119
 85 probably the main tool should be 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.489
 gun 85 millimeters but no no logic 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.800
 here the developer has a completely different one 

00:01:55.489 --> 00:02:00.890
 guns of course there is she presented but 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.179
 we have such a choice of two 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.370
 guns is the good old gun 122 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.010
 millimeter and but 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.500
 100 mm steering wheels and right here 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.640
 but of course everyone wonders if you can 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.580
 sq-85 play with the old that's it 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.550
 a hefty fool who shoots at 390 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.540
 at the sixth level with a ruler 175 answers 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.120
 yes you can yes this tool is presented but in 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.580
 This configuration tank is very very 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.830
 seriously ponerfili well firstly abruptly 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.720
 dropped damage per minute due to the fact that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.820
 recharge rate dropped and time 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.160
 recharge has grown much earlier she 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.910
 was in the area tank 14 13 and a half 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.190
 seconds i'm now about 17 seconds and if 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.170
 It seems to you that this is a slight change. 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.620
 then I will tell you so much 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.300
 felt if the numbers then dpm 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.390
 But with this instrument is something 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.430
 about 1400 damage per minute 1400 and for 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.890
 comparisons given that a lot is small for 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.020
 comparisons for example in cromwell which 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.200
 same level on the sixth there is something 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.060
 about 2,300 as far as i remember and if not 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.280
 God bless you with some e25 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.280
 meet then there in the region of 3000 that is 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.860
 just stupid twice as much but of course 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.110
 these are tanks as an example and I brought with high 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.320
 minute damage but really class shoots 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.250
 very rarely and now with this instrument 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.980
 nicklas app -85 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.950
 with this weapon well this is something you know 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.830
 closer to at 2 already by recharge it is very 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.930
 seriously felt very uncomfortable 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.209
 especially unusual after the old kvass 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.670
 but if to someone this change seems not 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.920
 very significant then the second thing 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.490
 important i think 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.470
 not even this angles before angle was 8 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.150
 degrees guns all went fine 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.360
 it was comfortable wonderful now 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.360
 3 degrees down and 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.420
 it's just sadness on every bump you have 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.310
 guns looking up any hills you 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.500
 just contraindicated those who played 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.290
 the Chinese understand that three degrees down 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.910
 it is very difficult it is practically not 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.989
 playable to this need very seriously 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.330
 getting used to it is probably the main minus 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.700
 Apt-85 at the moment in general in their 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.739
 sensations with a gun 122 millimeters this 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.829
 the tank is now completely disliked 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.080
 but an alternative appeared 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.600
 gun 100 millimeters in which earlier 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.600
 there was nâ€™t and here you know everything already 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.100
 much better because breaking through 170 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.560
 damage 250 and recharge 6 half 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.490
 seconds and you know it already absolutely 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.070
 fine 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.620
 cannon is nice especially after 122 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.810
 millimeter she's pretty accurate well how 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.210
 relatively accurately but sometimes even 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.130
 shoot more or less some 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.560
 stabilization is and damage per minute here 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.060
 normal that is, the instrument as a whole 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.280
 its characteristics are very very 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.960
 not bad and here with this gun you know it 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.210
 completely different tank that is it is no longer 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.880
 that class is already just like 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.090
 another car is completely different car 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680
 other gameplay and at the same time the tank remained 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.800
 vigorous enough i mean it is quite 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.260
 normally goes again the most important 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.150
 minus corners it's just catastrophic 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.070
 minus this tank at the moment then 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.020
 I probably will not be on it 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.970
 longer ride us just because of the angles 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.400
 because three degrees down to me personally 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.810
 it is very unpleasant uncomfortable but still 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.370
 I will say it again with this instrument 100 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.130
 millimeters I think it will be 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.250
 normal normal car it won't 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.490
 already so which would have been before kvass 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.380
 which was famous for the whole random 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.740
 now it will be a little bit different 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.960
 there is a pass machine with quite 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.090
 normal 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.580
 people 100 millimeters where you can 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.710
 great to play and I think even some 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.120
 good results will show more 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.190
 tell on the test server very 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.550
 difficult to evaluate a lot of light tanks 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:56.180
 which of course kv-85 do elementary 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.940
 shoot myself but in general, in principle 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.310
 impressions okay resume such that 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.250
 this is absolutely not the kind of brew that 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.860
 accustomed lovers 122 millimeters rudi 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.830
 They will be disappointed that's 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.199
 not even of course in this configuration 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.900
 122 millimeter for me personally, the tank is not very 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.550
 Liked but due to the alternative 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.560
 cannons 100 millimeters play on it 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.940
 will it be possible it will be a normal car 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400
 not imba 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.449
 absolutely this is not the same brew that 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.360
 famous in the random 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:29.509
 this is a car that will play 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.580
 from normal passing that and here are 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.440
 thoughts such a brew and on this for today 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.440
 all and not thank you for your attention
