talking about bracketing well it does
somewhat<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> polls

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
somewhat I don't know that the polls

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590 
somewhat I don't know that the polls
carry<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.710> much<00:00:47.010> weight<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.399> RPI<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.480> who

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
carry as much weight as RPI and who

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.389 
carry as much weight as RPI and who
you've<00:00:48.780> played<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.410> how<00:00:49.500> those<00:00:49.739> teams<00:00:50.100> do

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

throughout<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.030> year<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:52.230> guess<00:00:52.620> yes

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
throughout the year so I guess yes

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.750

more pressure on you or a bigger target

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.750

than being ranked number two I don't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570 
than being ranked number two I don't
think<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.110> five<00:01:13.500> ten<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.400> think

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
think so one two five ten I don't think

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.109 
think so one two five ten I don't think
it<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.700> matters<00:01:15.380> as<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.619> said<00:01:16.680> earlier<00:01:17.119> we

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
abilities but they also know if you look

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.369 
abilities but they also know if you look
at<00:06:06.029> the<00:06:06.119> history<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.509> the<00:06:06.629> game<00:06:06.809> both<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.289> the

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
at the history of the game both on the

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.109 
at the history of the game both on the
men's<00:06:07.589> side<00:06:07.709> and<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.099> women's<00:06:08.430> side<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.939> most

00:06:09.109 --> 00:06:09.119 
men's side and the women's side the most

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.579 
men's side and the women's side the most
talented<00:06:09.569> teams<00:06:09.869> don't<00:06:10.080> always<00:06:10.439> win

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
talented teams don't always win

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.609 
talented teams don't always win
championships<00:06:11.249> I<00:06:11.520> do<00:06:12.419> believe<00:06:12.899> this<00:06:13.259> there's

00:06:13.609 --> 00:06:13.619 
championships I do believe this there's

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.739 
championships I do believe this there's
a<00:06:13.680> handful<00:06:14.159> on<00:06:14.459> the<00:06:14.789> women's<00:06:14.939> side<00:06:15.149> right<00:06:15.599> now

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:15.749 
a handful on the women's side right now

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.659 
a handful on the women's side right now
that<00:06:15.959> can<00:06:16.080> win<00:06:16.289> a<00:06:16.319> national<00:06:16.559> championship<00:06:16.860> and

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
that can win a national championship and

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.929 
that can win a national championship and
I<00:06:17.759> think<00:06:18.029> we're<00:06:18.180> one<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.389> them<00:06:18.680> but<00:06:19.680> which<00:06:20.669> one

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939 
I think we're one of them but which one

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.179 
I think we're one of them but which one
of<00:06:20.969> those<00:06:21.180> teams<00:06:21.539> improves<00:06:22.199> the<00:06:22.379> most<00:06:22.649> between

00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.189 
of those teams improves the most between

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629 
those teams plays with the best team

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.540 
those teams plays with the best team
chemistry<00:06:27.930> between<00:06:28.409> now<00:06:28.860> and<00:06:29.189> the<00:06:29.279> end<00:06:29.309> of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
chemistry between now and the end of

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.939 
chemistry between now and the end of
March<00:06:29.879> which<00:06:30.539> one<00:06:30.749> of<00:06:30.779> those<00:06:30.959> team<00:06:31.319> stays<00:06:31.649> away

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
March which one of those team stays away

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.739 
March which one of those team stays away
from<00:06:31.979> injuries<00:06:32.580> between<00:06:32.819> now<00:06:33.269> and<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.539> end<00:06:33.569> of

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:33.749 
from injuries between now and the end of

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:35.689 
from injuries between now and the end of
March<00:06:34.050> and<00:06:34.319> those<00:06:34.619> are<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.860> teams<00:06:35.580> that

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
March and those are the teams that

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:42.549 
March and those are the teams that
usually<00:06:36.080> survive<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.379> win<00:06:37.499> a<00:06:37.529> championship<00:06:37.830> I

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:42.559 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.469 

think<00:06:43.559> a<00:06:43.619> handful<00:06:44.069> and<00:06:44.459> that's<00:06:44.999> just<00:06:45.119> my

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
think a handful and that's just my

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:49.219 
think a handful and that's just my
opinion<00:06:45.509> I<00:06:46.110> I<00:06:46.349> think<00:06:47.039> there<00:06:47.279> are<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:48.509> odds<00:06:48.689> of

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
opinion I I think there are the odds of

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.059 
opinion I I think there are the odds of
one<00:06:50.039> coming<00:06:50.519> out<00:06:50.669> of<00:06:50.699> the<00:06:50.909> mix<00:06:51.180> that<00:06:51.860> you<00:06:52.860> don't

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
one coming out of the mix that you don't

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.579 
one coming out of the mix that you don't
think<00:06:53.159> is<00:06:53.669> always<00:06:54.419> there<00:06:54.839> we<00:06:55.229> were<00:06:55.379> one<00:06:55.559> of

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:55.589 
think is always there we were one of

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.179 
think is always there we were one of
those<00:06:55.829> teams<00:06:56.129> a<00:06:56.339> three<00:06:56.610> seed<00:06:56.879> back<00:06:57.149> in<00:06:57.329> 05<00:06:58.189> but

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
those teams a three seed back in 05 but

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.519 
those teams a three seed back in 05 but
I<00:06:59.219> think<00:06:59.639> if<00:06:59.849> you<00:07:00.389> look<00:07:00.659> at<00:07:00.779> the<00:07:00.899> talent<00:07:01.349> across

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529 
I think if you look at the talent across

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.069 
I think if you look at the talent across
the<00:07:01.829> country<00:07:02.279> and<00:07:02.309> and<00:07:02.639> who's<00:07:03.209> played<00:07:03.569> who<00:07:03.839> and

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:04.079 
the country and and who's played who and

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:06.230 
the country and and who's played who and
who's<00:07:04.259> beaten<00:07:04.680> who<00:07:04.860> I<00:07:05.099> think<00:07:05.819> that<00:07:06.029> there's

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
who's beaten who I think that there's

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.989 
who's beaten who I think that there's
there's<00:07:06.569> a<00:07:06.629> handful<00:07:07.139> in<00:07:07.319> my<00:07:07.559> opinion<00:07:07.979> that<00:07:08.669> are

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:08.999 
there's a handful in my opinion that are

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.149 
there's a handful in my opinion that are
the<00:07:09.240> most<00:07:09.479> talented<00:07:10.050> teams<00:07:10.379> and<00:07:10.769> I<00:07:10.949> think

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
the most talented teams and I think

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.089 
the most talented teams and I think
Baylor<00:07:11.459> is<00:07:11.579> one<00:07:11.759> of<00:07:11.909> them
