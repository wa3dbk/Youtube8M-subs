 major producer and exporter of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 cotton but went through a few moments 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 difficult with the arrival of a plague and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.890
 whenever we say we are that sometimes there 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 difficulty is something very special and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.729
 unique in paraíba that is the cotton 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.229
 colored cotton it was born from 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.840
 need of the plague problem 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 bullet and there for the work developed 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.110

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 technology on top of this transformation 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.080
 this is something that is cuba that 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 occurred more than ten years ago 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.820
 hence the great to great 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.130
 revolution until it has already got handicrafts 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.990
 even if today there are several paraíba 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 chains including this work had 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.500
 beginning in the meadow through the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.320
 maianga of the line is to whom we also 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.899
 It's so I think I've been a 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 very important for this one for that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.110
 work and development 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 Today colorful cotton we export 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.060
 Let's say well, and to Brazil, all 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.460
 states today against our product 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.229
 nor is it a product that is already recognized 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.909
 geographically with our product 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.659

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.290
 if you change your clothes to fashion in the case 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.290
 accessories like earrings necklaces 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.859
 Look how interesting is that what you 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.810
 is in the cruel color of cotton but this 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.750
 darker also cotton and it is not 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 paint the cotton does not get any better 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.980
 As we can see here it is not 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.810
 naturally occurring has even 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.849
 cotton view will show you a piece of 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.090
 cotton kiss for you to see that amazing 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.250
 What is it, how cool is it? 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.290
 there is no painting that is all natural 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.819
 now I was composing the crafts 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.609

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.349

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.419
 clothing with the use of the craft 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.780
 application here of embroidery flowers 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:01.269
 That's what he brought us too. 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 an environmentally friendly product 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.500
 People do not think it's right to go 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.650
 painting area eg basket adds 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.989
 the workmanship of the artisan where he works 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 with scripts with a staff that makes a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.329
 camera with embroiderers then involves 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.950
 whole productive chain and that manages 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.159
 for economical paraiba is very 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.159
 important 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.370
 and you can see belts of macrame 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.220
 leaves flowers here have made by 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.140
 finally all natural cotton hair 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.880

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.890
 thank you so much for the explanation papers 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.960
 by the initiative is I think it is also 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.090
 so it gives a great teaching because 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.060
 as I said a little bit of a big 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.430
 difficulty was born a victory and today 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.380

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060

 economy culture why the more things 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.539
 I think this teaches us a lesson to 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.120
 We sometimes think that a plague 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.940
 example comes to destroy and in this case 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.740
 a solution was born there and this solution 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.110

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.570
