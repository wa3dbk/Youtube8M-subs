mean it's definitely not too big by any
means<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.880> mean<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.360> she<00:03:20.720> can<00:03:21.200> wear<00:03:21.320> also<00:03:21.739> wear<00:03:21.950> a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
means I mean it she can wear also wear a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.960 
means I mean it she can wear also wear a
newborn<00:03:24.050> but<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.620> newborn<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.220> way<00:03:25.430> big<00:03:25.790> in

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
newborn but the newborn is way big in

newborn but the newborn is way big in
the<00:03:26.090> legs<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:27.560> only<00:03:27.770> reason<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.160> bought<00:03:28.670> the

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
the legs so the only reason I bought the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.449 
the legs so the only reason I bought the
preemie<00:03:29.239> was<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.590> length<00:03:30.770> of

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
preemie was just because the length of

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.190 
preemie was just because the length of
the<00:03:31.670> baby

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the baby

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.800 
the baby
