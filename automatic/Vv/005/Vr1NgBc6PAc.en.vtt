00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
myself all right you know if you spores

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.280 
myself all right you know if you spores
then<00:02:33.920> go<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:35.120> I'll<00:02:35.330> take<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.750> chances

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
then go you know I'll take the chances

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.690 
then go you know I'll take the chances
of<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.280> chances<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
of that but the chances of that

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.130 
of that but the chances of that
happening<00:02:37.819> obviously<00:02:38.150> just<00:02:38.540> very<00:02:38.750> low<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.110> I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
properly you basically win because you

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.529

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
the game game still not necessarily over

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.490

kind<00:05:19.349> of<00:05:19.410> gaining<00:05:19.650> popularity<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.550> there's<00:05:21.240> a

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
kind of gaining popularity so there's a

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.430 
kind of gaining popularity so there's a
play<00:05:21.449> like<00:05:21.599> definitely<00:05:21.960> could<00:05:22.050> have<00:05:22.080> happened

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
play like definitely could have happened

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.710 
play like definitely could have happened
but<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:23.610> me<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.789> seem<00:05:24.000> more<00:05:24.120> likely<00:05:24.330> that<00:05:24.449> i<00:05:24.570> can

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
but to me a seem more likely that i can

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.149 
but to me a seem more likely that i can
we<00:05:24.780> just<00:05:24.960> go<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.289> sport<00:05:25.590> with<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.830> mingus

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
we just go for the sport with the mingus

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.850 
we just go for the sport with the mingus
which<00:05:26.669> is<00:05:26.970> presumably<00:05:27.300> what<00:05:27.690> he<00:05:27.780> did<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.320> I'm

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
which is presumably what he did so I'm

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.170 
which is presumably what he did so I'm
just<00:05:29.130> gonna<00:05:29.250> switch<00:05:29.460> out<00:05:29.550> Garchomp<00:05:29.940> here<00:05:30.060> to

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
just gonna switch out Garchomp here to

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.430 
just gonna switch out Garchomp here to
get<00:05:30.330> rid<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.599> minus<00:05:30.720> one<00:05:31.050> draw<00:05:31.260> from

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
get rid of the minus one draw from

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.439 
get rid of the minus one draw from
intimidate<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.099> in<00:05:32.190> case<00:05:32.340> /<00:05:32.789> he<00:05:32.909> misses<00:05:33.270> but

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
intimidate just in case / he misses but

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.180 
intimidate just in case / he misses but

gonna win the game pretty decisively for

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.409

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
few turns the predictions in the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.960 
few turns the predictions in the
beginning<00:05:40.860> really<00:05:41.340> helped<00:05:41.639> me<00:05:41.729> out<00:05:41.760> a<00:05:41.849> lot

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
beginning really helped me out a lot

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.420 
beginning really helped me out a lot
predicting<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:42.930> movies<00:05:43.289> protect<00:05:43.650> uh<00:05:43.830> making

predicting the movies protect uh making
the<00:05:44.580> safest<00:05:44.909> play<00:05:45.030> possible<00:05:45.479> and<00:05:45.570> nailing<00:05:45.750> in

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
the safest play possible and nailing in

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.450 
the safest play possible and nailing in
the<00:05:46.050> Solomons<00:05:46.440> in<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.590> switch<00:05:46.800> with<00:05:47.010> switch

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
the Solomons in the switch with switch

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.430 
the Solomons in the switch with switch
in<00:05:47.669> I've<00:05:48.240> really<00:05:48.510> just<00:05:48.539> help<00:05:48.960> me<00:05:49.110> win<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.320> game

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
pretty much from the beginning so um

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.270 
pretty much from the beginning so um
yeah<00:05:52.320> that<00:05:52.500> was<00:05:52.620> something<00:05:52.860> with<00:05:52.979> this<00:05:53.070> team

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
yeah that was something with this team

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.010 
yeah that was something with this team
it<00:05:53.430> was<00:05:53.520> heavy<00:05:53.789> offense<00:05:54.210> if<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.479> played<00:05:54.870> your

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
it was heavy offense if you played your

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.870 
it was heavy offense if you played your
opponent<00:05:55.470> if<00:05:55.650> you<00:05:55.919> predicted<00:05:56.460> them<00:05:56.550> correctly

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
opponent if you predicted them correctly

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.000 
opponent if you predicted them correctly
you<00:05:57.090> would<00:05:57.210> win<00:05:57.389> oftentimes<00:05:58.169> you<00:05:58.470> know<00:05:58.620> my

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
you would win oftentimes you know my

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.140 
you would win oftentimes you know my
opponent<00:05:59.190> obviously<00:05:59.669> could<00:05:59.760> have<00:05:59.849> just<00:05:59.970> made

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
opponent obviously could have just made

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.129 
opponent obviously could have just made
some<00:06:00.330> plays<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.840> could<00:06:00.960> have<00:06:01.050> gone

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
some plays and it could have gone

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.050 
some plays and it could have gone
completely<00:06:01.289> differently<00:06:02.099> say<00:06:02.400> if<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.550> just

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
completely differently say if you just

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.790 
completely differently say if you just
sport<00:06:03.659> with<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:03.900> movies<00:06:04.199> on<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.380> first<00:06:04.590> third

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
sport with the movies on the first third

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.670 
sport with the movies on the first third
or<00:06:04.979> protected<00:06:05.580> tyranitar<00:06:06.060> but<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:07.260> was<00:06:07.349> kind

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
or protected tyranitar but that was kind

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.839 
or protected tyranitar but that was kind
of<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.770> point<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.159> team<00:06:08.370> just<00:06:08.580> beat<00:06:08.729> your

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849
