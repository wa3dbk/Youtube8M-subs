sure<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.239> oh<00:02:53.480> it's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
sure if I can see like a little oh it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.559 
sure if I can see like a little oh it's
the<00:02:54.739> air<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.100> set<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.299> sort<00:02:56.540> of

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
the air you can set this is sort of

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.800 
the air you can set this is sort of
pushing<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.730> there's<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.880> trend<00:02:59.209> there's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
pushing in there's a trend there's

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.979 
pushing in there's a trend there's
Optimus<00:03:00.650> Prime<00:03:00.920> transformed<00:03:01.580> bit<00:03:02.510> weird<00:03:02.870> to

here push down to the front so it drops
into<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.250> holes<00:03:46.489> like<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.709> then<00:03:48.709> you<00:03:49.069> then

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
into the holes like that then you then

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.420 
into the holes like that then you then
you<00:03:50.030> can<00:03:50.630> push<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:51.049> down<00:03:51.350> into<00:03:51.620> those<00:03:51.920> slots

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
you can push this down into those slots

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.990 
you can push this down into those slots
on<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.790> side<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:54.829> make<00:03:54.859> sure<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.430> think<00:03:55.819> that

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
on the side to make sure I think that
