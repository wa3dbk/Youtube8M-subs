00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.690
 very good we are all in a new 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.830
 video of gta 5 and today I bring a very 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.170
 interesting to exist in the 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.559
 comments the other day and you said that 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.330
 I made a challenge with the air and you and I 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.230
 running so let's do it though 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.420
 I honestly do not believe that I win 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.939
 running because I do not know is that if I run 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.070
 more with an airbus it would be super pathetic 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.430
 so first let's see how much 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.650
 We take running from one side to the other 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.150
 ok but not from this point but from 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.550
 another because from this point there was a 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.590
 moment in which it jumps and since then there 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.200
 finished everything so I'm going to do it from 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 the other side so now come and well 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.649
 we are already here from the other end 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.149
 faster from another perspective we will 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.120
 see if we can overcome the air that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.860
 time that he did that I think they were 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.460
 thirty-two seconds so over there 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.640
 we go 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.719
 and good honestly I see it a little bit 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.539
 slower 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.570
 I do not think I think it's not going to 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.910
 exceed ten seconds 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.530
 good stories good story because you 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.860
 I can tell the story of my life in 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.290
 this good time I plan to go up 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.990
 part of this video and one of red dead 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 redemption wanted to play online worth and 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.720
 well I want to have a little game because 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.220
 I liked that game I did not reach it 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 happen I know it's a crime does not happen in 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.630
 that game but do not let it happen and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.280
 apart I am preparing many videos of 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 watch dock for as of Tuesday 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.350
 we upload a lot of video the west 2 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.600
 that I already have it and I go for 25% it's worth and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.950
 it's a good game a good game took away 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.740
 a lot of criticism but to me 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.840
 liking a lot so I count in enough 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.060
 videos about about it so good already 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.560
 we are approaching the days we are 50 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.390
 seconds has not surpassed the youtube 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.149
 We will see to see the difference there 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.670
 between yesterday you and me running so there 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.990
 we are not even needed for the video 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.330
 57 seconds so let's go for the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.979
 so good race are there prepared 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.590
 if they leave they leave the finish line and 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.300
 as I am not I have had the acceleration 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 better than the airbus but virtue 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.539
 It's already gone, it's gone, it's going there, it's exactly 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 the same story but with the cadiz of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.420
 the youtube but the other way around 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.099
 the chalice and let virtue go back 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.019
 very back and the air has done the same 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.910
 with me running but let's go 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.310
 predictable simply because I liked the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.840
 comment that a subscriber said 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 that he does not run and I with the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.260
 air because I did not tell you in a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.790
 comment of a video I say is that I 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.360
 running I run more than the air but not 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.240
 is not so good I think the to 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 YouTube is the only test in which you will 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.170
 be able to win because I do not think that another 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 car seat have been so like genes not 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.090
 I think another vehicle 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.430
 run less so there we have it wins 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.250
 the air for the first time victory and for 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.840
 last so good here that we arrived 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.450
 there we walk because we are tired already 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.800
 with man he gets tired so good what 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.300
 said I hope you liked it 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.570
 won the air 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.850
 many of us believed that I was running and 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.440
 I also believed that but in the end I did not 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.480
 so I hope you liked it 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.550
 a greeting today we are going to the next see 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.550
 if we can arrive the same as the 4
