just leave it empty if you don't want to
pay<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> upgrade<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
pay for the upgrade and it's just you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
pay for the upgrade and it's just you
know<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.220> painted<00:01:41.729> green<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.659> barely

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
know it's painted green so it's barely

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.660 
know it's painted green so it's barely
noticeable<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.829> snap<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> new<00:01:44.520> one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
noticeable or you can snap on a new one

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
noticeable or you can snap on a new one
as<00:01:44.820> well<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.899> there's<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.320> types

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
as well and then there's the two types

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600 
as well and then there's the two types
of<00:01:46.590> missile<00:01:46.860> launchers<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.460> pop

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
of missile launchers where you just pop

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.950 
of missile launchers where you just pop
that<00:01:47.640> off<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> other<00:01:48.600> missiles

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that off and put on the other missiles

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.359 
that off and put on the other missiles
and<00:01:49.079> all<00:01:49.170> three<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> these<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.829> exactly<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and all three of these have exactly the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
and all three of these have exactly the
same<00:01:50.460> option<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.810> hadn't<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
same option and so I hadn't do that the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.420 
same option and so I hadn't do that the
other<00:01:52.439> nice<00:01:52.680> thing<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.070> Imperial

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
other nice thing about these Imperial

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.469 
other nice thing about these Imperial
Knights<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> assemble<00:01:54.390> them

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
Knights is that if you assemble them

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.260 
Knights is that if you assemble them
right<00:01:54.630> they're<00:01:55.140> all<00:01:55.320> poseable<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.119> their

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
right they're all poseable so not their

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.429 
right they're all poseable so not their
fingers<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.750> thumbs<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.140> would<00:01:58.290> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
fingers and thumbs that would be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.219 
fingers and thumbs that would be
ridiculously<00:01:59.340> awesome<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.960> so

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
ridiculously awesome but they are not so

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.389 
ridiculously awesome but they are not so

them<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.659> good<00:02:03.780> job<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> painting<00:02:04.290> them

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
them a really good job of painting them

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.249 
them a really good job of painting them
though<00:02:05.420> that's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.540> part<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> paint<00:02:07.079> job

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
