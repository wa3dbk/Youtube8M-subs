00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.460
 girl yo all huge hello today 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 I want to share with you my choice 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.359
 new year makeup makeup code 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 name blue horse or how to increase 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:33.450
 eye is five times the very first step is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 application on primed eye oily 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 blue pencil in the form of a wide arrow 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.010
 the arrow can be drawn boldly and not 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.770
 too neat anyway then and this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.989
 a matter of idleness why are you doing and why 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.610
 I do not draw in pencil all 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.860
 surface of the upper eyelid 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.010
 all this is done to our 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 the contribution eventually came out volumetric that is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 we will have the greatest mass of color 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.309
 on the line of the arrow 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.829
 but how do I handle the crease 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.829
 look further will be on the vault intrigue 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.690
 after i shaded the arrow 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.380
 it's time to put the main color on 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.130
 movable eyelid i use stunning 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.260
 beauty blue tint from inglot 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.450
 I put it raids with tight 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.390
 packed but rather short flat 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.360
 rounded brushes by the way 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.350
 I just link to shade at all here 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:43.090
 This has to be the main make-up dream 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 horse remnants of shadows on the brush and 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.470
 schedule a tab then them not yet 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.240
 back for now just a little bit 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.060
 let's mark then i take a black pencil and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.540
 I repeat them to the arrow line but her case 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 a little thinner than the previous must also 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 accuracy can be much and not trudge 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.130
 the arrow is done with the follow 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 feathering 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.600
 I again take the same brush and start 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.760
 pull the drawn line to the top in 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.340
 that sho you are her main color and 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.500
 at the same time fixing a fat pencil 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.700
 remnants of darker on the brush 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.430
 and now that same trick with ears 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.650
 crease the thing is now brush 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.870
 and a very rich mixture of core 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.510
 shade shadow and black pencil and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 it is we who draw the fold 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.580
 adding to the eye the desired amount but keeping 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.080
 at the same time the color monotony of makeup 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.140
 I walk a little along the bottom line 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.230
 eyelashes for now just schedule and and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.530
 and again take up the black pencil 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.930
 first draw the upper mucous membrane 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.880
 then the bottom in what when walk 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.080
 on the bottom waterline you need to draw 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.370
 smartly and and 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.370
 but also the roots of the eyelashes 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.049
 it's time to shade this line all 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 the same brush and all the same remnants 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.470
 theme 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.230
 but where there is a lack of color I still 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.710
 add dip 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.710
 these 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.780
 and now you need a little makeup 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.420
 I take the light matte shade and the first 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.400
 I give them blood by deed and then 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.620
 remnants of light prices and 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.620
 and feathering the fold border 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.400
 why i take exactly matte shade all 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.750
 the thing is, I don't want to 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.129
 further conflict sparkling 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.870
 shades of magic not 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:16.180
 and now let's turn the banal blue smokey 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.669
 add to the more festive version 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.919
 gold on a small flat brush i 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.530
 I apply a little bit of a golden hue of shadows 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.620
 and first of all I highlight the inner corner 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.000
 eyes and then pass a little 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.950
 border of blue shadows on the lower eyelid 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.760
 shading this way with golden 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.760
 shade 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.980
 Well, the most important part of doing 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.190
 black is the same golden shade i do 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.410
 smear on the center of the century and then 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.730
 pulling people away brushing and shading 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.790
 reducing to nothing 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.970
 not only that so we add 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.700
 some zest banal sounds so also 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.840
 there will be more volume in the eye and 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.510
 expressiveness do not delay far 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.000
 gold, we will come back to it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.230
 paint eyelashes you can safely add 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.620
 invoices 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.770
 but I'll just make them more volume 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.390
 using evelyn serum and put 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.390
 more black mascara 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.770
 go back to gold and add 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.470
 saturation in the lower line at the outer 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.540
 corner of the eye quite a bit not to 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.350
 focus on this but only 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.510
 add the final touch if you want 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.760
 draw more attention to yourself then 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.280
 on lip gloss can be applied pink and 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.410
 add pink blush but I today 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.660
 would prefer a more neutral option 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.460
 minutes this lip gloss in order not to 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.820
 distract that very attention from makeup 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.820
 eye 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.250
 I sincerely hope this is all 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.380
 the video turned out to be interesting for you and 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.780
 it may even be useful thanks for that 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.240
 stayed with me until the end sincerely wish 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:37.010
 you all the most gentle and gentle and 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.010
 fluffy in the new year
