00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
seems at the moment the Siberian Husky

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.589 
seems at the moment the Siberian Husky
seemed<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.230> be<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:59.010> one<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.549> the<00:03:00.120> type<00:03:00.359> of

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
seemed to be the one that the type of

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.720 
seemed to be the one that the type of
dog<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.260> people<00:03:01.739> people<00:03:02.069> want<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.489> want

to buy yeah I'm in there beautiful dogs
but<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:07.140> don't<00:03:07.709> think<00:03:07.980> too<00:03:08.310> many<00:03:08.430> people

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
but I don't think too many people

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.869 
but I don't think too many people
actually<00:03:09.299> know<00:03:09.660> about<00:03:10.200> them<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.680> mean<00:03:11.640> they<00:03:11.760> are

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
actually know about them I mean they are

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.150 
actually know about them I mean they are
most<00:03:12.629> closely<00:03:13.079> related<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> wolf<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.010> mean

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
most closely related to the wolf I mean

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.979 
most closely related to the wolf I mean
all<00:03:14.310> dogs<00:03:14.579> are<00:03:14.819> but<00:03:15.120> then<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
all dogs are but then you you know you

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.690 
all dogs are but then you you know you
look<00:03:16.230> at<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:16.410> say<00:03:16.560> your<00:03:16.739> Labradoodle<00:03:17.250> very

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
look at you say your Labradoodle very

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.039 
look at you say your Labradoodle very
little<00:03:17.970> Westies<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:18.510> don't<00:03:18.720> really

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
little Westies and they don't really

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.400 
little Westies and they don't really
look<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.889> wolf<00:03:20.190> particularly<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:22.290> know

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
look like a wolf particularly you know

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.789 
look like a wolf particularly you know
the<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.010> Huskies<00:03:23.549> do<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.900> do<00:03:25.260> take<00:03:25.620> them

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
the the Huskies do but they do take them

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.650 
the the Huskies do but they do take them
looking<00:03:26.099> after<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:26.609> believe<00:03:26.910> Murphy<00:03:27.510> tried

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
looking after and I believe Murphy tried

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.199 
looking after and I believe Murphy tried
about<00:03:27.959> eight<00:03:28.230> owners<00:03:28.769> prior<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.790> II<00:03:30.000> take

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
about eight owners prior to and II take

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.000 
about eight owners prior to and II take
him<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.540> two<00:03:30.750> years<00:03:31.049> ago<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.410> he's<00:03:31.500> only<00:03:31.680> four

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
him on two years ago and he's only four

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.699 
him on two years ago and he's only four
now<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:33.450> was<00:03:33.569> poisoned<00:03:33.989> as<00:03:34.109> a<00:03:34.139> party<00:03:34.680> and

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
now and it was poisoned as a party and

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.180 
now and it was poisoned as a party and
all<00:03:34.950> sort<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.840> you've<00:03:37.739> got<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
there's that pretty solid but you can

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.400 
there's that pretty solid but you can
get<00:03:44.940> some<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.299> people<00:03:45.599> aren't<00:03:45.810> aware<00:03:46.139> of

get some that people aren't aware of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.589 
get some that people aren't aware of
like<00:03:47.280> you've<00:03:47.400> got<00:03:47.549> file<00:03:47.849> isn't<00:03:48.180> all<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.389> rest
