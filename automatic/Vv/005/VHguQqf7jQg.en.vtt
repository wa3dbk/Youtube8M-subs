slider I've tried and it is by far the
best<00:00:16.039> no<00:00:17.039> no<00:00:17.490> competition<00:00:18.119> even<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.449> know<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
best no no competition even you know it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070 
best no no competition even you know it
blows<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.140> rest<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> water<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:21.080> yeah

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
blows the rest out of the water and yeah

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.050 
blows the rest out of the water and yeah
it's<00:00:22.350> smooth<00:00:22.710> smooth<00:00:23.189> smooth<00:00:23.519> smooth<00:00:23.789> it's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
it's smooth smooth smooth smooth it's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.870 
it's smooth smooth smooth smooth it's
got<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.930> feels<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:25.260> there's<00:00:25.529> actually<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
got it feels like there's actually you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
got it feels like there's actually you
know<00:00:26.970> smooth<00:00:27.420> friction<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> feels<00:00:28.380> like

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
know smooth friction it feels like

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
know smooth friction it feels like
almost<00:00:29.070> fluid<00:00:29.750> friction<00:00:30.750> inside<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.410> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
almost fluid friction inside there so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.560 
almost fluid friction inside there so
you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.769> move<00:00:31.920> really<00:00:32.219> smoothly<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.480> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you can move really smoothly but it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
you can move really smoothly but it
doesn't<00:00:33.750> jerk<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.530> doesn't<00:00:34.739> move<00:00:34.829> too

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
doesn't jerk and it doesn't move too

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
doesn't jerk and it doesn't move too
quickly<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.480> allows<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
quickly and it really allows you to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.860 
quickly and it really allows you to
control<00:00:37.110> your<00:00:37.350> move<00:00:37.530> perfectly<00:00:38.450> at<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> same

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
control your move perfectly at the same

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
control your move perfectly at the same
time<00:00:40.250> it's<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.520> things<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.180> be

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
time it's got these things which can be

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.869 
time it's got these things which can be
used<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.510> keep<00:00:42.719> dust<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> there<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.879> well

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
used to keep dust out of there as well

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.420 
used to keep dust out of there as well
as<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.870> used<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.079> hard<00:00:46.320> stops<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:49.430> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
as can be used as hard stops and to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.029 
as can be used as hard stops and to
clean<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.030> realm<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.960> dust<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.890> you've<00:00:53.010> got

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
clean the realm of dust so you've got

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.360 
clean the realm of dust so you've got
two<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> those<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> feet<00:00:54.719> are<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.829> great<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
two of those the feet are really great a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.660 
two of those the feet are really great a
massive<00:00:57.210> improvement<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.550> really<00:00:59.550> bad

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
massive improvement on the really bad

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.810 
massive improvement on the really bad
quality<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> No<00:01:01.949> Name<00:01:02.129> slider<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
take on and off when you don't need it
unlike<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.630> no-name<00:01:22.530> slider<00:01:22.799> where<00:01:23.130> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
unlike the no-name slider where it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
unlike the no-name slider where it
doesn't<00:01:24.060> even<00:01:24.119> come<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.560> really

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
doesn't even come off so that's really

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.050

great they come in there and pouches and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.420 
great they come in there and pouches and
the<00:01:30.060> case<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.420> comes<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> slider<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
the case that comes with the slider is

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.929 
the case that comes with the slider is
perfect<00:01:32.430> really<00:01:33.000> high<00:01:33.210> quality<00:01:33.530> not

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
perfect really high quality not

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.249 
perfect really high quality not
massively<00:01:35.939> oversized<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> no-name

massively oversized like a no-name
roller<00:01:37.560> bearing<00:01:37.799> slider<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:40.700> yeah<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.939> feels

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
roller bearing slider and yeah it feels

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
roller bearing slider and yeah it feels
you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.259> good<00:01:43.500> quality

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you know just really good quality

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.039 
you know just really good quality
something<00:01:43.979> that'll<00:01:44.159> last<00:01:46.369> apart<00:01:47.369> from<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
something that'll last apart from that

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.060 
something that'll last apart from that
there's<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.290> much<00:01:49.530> more<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.920> say

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
there's not really much more I can say

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
there's not really much more I can say
in<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.430> quick<00:01:50.700> video<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.240> there's<00:01:51.960> more

questions<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.770> stuff<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.189> may<00:01:53.369> make<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:54.540> know

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
questions and stuff I may make you know

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.319 
questions and stuff I may make you know
a<00:01:54.689> new<00:01:54.840> video<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.320> full<00:01:55.530> review<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.340> that's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
a new video or full review but that's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.730 
a new video or full review but that's
basically<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> say<00:01:58.439> about<00:01:58.590> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
basically all I have to say about this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.120 
basically all I have to say about this
there's<00:01:59.340> no<00:01:59.610> issue<00:01:59.880> whatsoever<00:02:00.890> none<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.040> all

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
there's no issue whatsoever none at all

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.249 
there's no issue whatsoever none at all
so<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> mean<00:02:02.969> there's<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.270> even<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.930> full

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so I mean there's not even really a full

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.600 
so I mean there's not even really a full
