on<00:00:11.610> 99<00:00:12.150> some<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.780> Explorer<00:00:14.030> see<00:00:15.030> what's<00:00:15.240> going

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
on 99 some for Explorer see what's going

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.370 
on 99 some for Explorer see what's going
on<00:00:15.780> there<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.070> dark<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:18.050> little<00:00:19.050> hole

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
on there it's kind of dark a little hole

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.859 
on there it's kind of dark a little hole
right<00:00:19.410> there<00:00:21.710> there's<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> blower<00:00:23.369> motor<00:00:23.869> where

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
right there there's a blower motor where

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.009 
right there there's a blower motor where
the<00:00:24.990> resistor<00:00:25.380> goes<00:00:26.449> look<00:00:27.449> here's<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.869> old

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the resistor goes look here's the old

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.799 
the resistor goes look here's the old
one<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:33.360> here's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> new<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:35.719> uses<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
one and here's a new one uses the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.970 
one and here's a new one uses the
problems<00:00:37.140> caused<00:00:37.350> by<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.890> know

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
problems caused by the one you know

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.709 
problems caused by the one you know
what's<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.309> bad<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.510> your

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
what's going bad is it not all your

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
what's going bad is it not all your
heater<00:00:39.930> control<00:00:40.350> settings<00:00:40.710> worked<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.489> for

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
heater control settings worked as in for

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.010 
heater control settings worked as in for
example<00:00:42.530> low<00:00:44.030> medium<00:00:45.030> high<00:00:45.239> blah<00:00:45.629> blah<00:00:45.780> blah

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
example low medium high blah blah blah

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
example low medium high blah blah blah
basically<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.010> only<00:00:47.160> had<00:00:47.309> low<00:00:47.489> or<00:00:47.760> full<00:00:48.059> blast

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
basically I only had low or full blast

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.229 
basically I only had low or full blast
the<00:00:49.140> two<00:00:49.350> inner<00:00:49.530> controls<00:00:50.010> didn't<00:00:50.309> work<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the two inner controls didn't work so I

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
the two inner controls didn't work so I
looked<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> video<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
looked up a video how to do this

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
looked up a video how to do this
basically<00:00:54.300> they're<00:00:54.449> telling<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.020> to

and air filter box the bottom and you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
and air filter box the bottom and you
got<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> take<00:01:05.519> out<00:01:05.700> heater<00:01:06.450> motor<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.439> little

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
got to take out heater motor and little

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
got to take out heater motor and little
holes<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.700> goes<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.659> all

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.700 
holes that goes with it which is all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 

basically<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.689> take<00:01:12.840> off

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
basically all I had to do was take off

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.130 
basically all I had to do was take off
the<00:01:13.140> cruise<00:01:13.320> control<00:01:13.380> module<00:01:14.010> box<00:01:14.990> take<00:01:15.990> off

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the cruise control module box take off

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.450 
the cruise control module box take off
the<00:01:16.290> hose<00:01:17.119> that<00:01:18.119> goes<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:19.040> next<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.280> our

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the hose that goes around next on our

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.999 
the hose that goes around next on our
there<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.360> get<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.080> didn't<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> mess

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
there to get to it I didn't have to mess

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.060 
there to get to it I didn't have to mess
with<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> stuff<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.860> see

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
with a lot of this stuff as you can see

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
with a lot of this stuff as you can see
it's<00:01:26.189> all<00:01:26.280> together<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.900> old

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
it's all together and I got the old

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.219 
it's all together and I got the old
resistor<00:01:28.500> out<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.180> used<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.719 

graduate<00:01:35.720> and<00:01:37.130> eight<00:01:38.130> millimeter<00:01:38.610> socket

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
graduate and eight millimeter socket

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
graduate and eight millimeter socket
with<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.420> extension

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
with an extension

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
with an extension
basically<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.890> stick<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.759> can

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
basically you stick to right they can

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.450 
basically you stick to right they can
get<00:01:42.060> them<00:01:42.150> down<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:43.009> loosen<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.130> until

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
get them down in there loosen up until

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
get them down in there loosen up until
you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.700> finger<00:01:45.000> loose<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> with<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you can finger loose it with the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.380 
you can finger loose it with the
extension<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> socket<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.240> pull

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
extension and the socket then just pull

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.219 
extension and the socket then just pull
the<00:01:48.420> screws<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.049> fingers<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.840> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the screws all with your fingers but I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.929 
the screws all with your fingers but I
will<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> new<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.430> Charlie<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
will have the new one in Charlie and I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.830 
will have the new one in Charlie and I
will<00:01:54.090> take<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.240> quick<00:01:54.450> video<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> that
