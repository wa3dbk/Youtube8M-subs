comes to acne scars like I said acne

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.229 
comes to acne scars like I said acne
scars<00:02:51.830> are<00:02:51.980> nothing<00:02:52.250> more<00:02:52.400> than<00:02:52.550> an<00:02:52.670> injury<00:02:53.120> to

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
scars are nothing more than an injury to

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.720 
scars are nothing more than an injury to
the<00:02:53.420> skin<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.350> acne<00:02:55.100> occurred<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.549> first

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the skin so acne occurred in the first

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.880 
the skin so acne occurred in the first
place<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.030> inflammation<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.440> bacteria

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
place that inflammation and the bacteria

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.860 
place that inflammation and the bacteria
that<00:02:57.950> build-up<00:02:58.370> clubbed<00:02:58.760> cause<00:02:59.150> congestion

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
that build-up clubbed cause congestion

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.600 
that build-up clubbed cause congestion
was<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.080> an<00:03:00.200> injury<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.860> skin<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
was like an injury to the skin and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.180 
was like an injury to the skin and
caused<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.120> lesion<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.750> fibrous<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:04.070> know

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
caused that lesion that fibrous you know

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.810 
caused that lesion that fibrous you know
protein<00:03:04.940> based<00:03:05.360> scar<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.500> skin<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.100> it

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
protein based scar and the skin and it

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.490 
protein based scar and the skin and it
never<00:03:07.940> fully<00:03:08.209> recovered<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.810> never<00:03:08.959> healed

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
never fully recovered it never healed

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.070 
never fully recovered it never healed
I<00:03:09.590> guess<00:03:10.010> that's<00:03:10.250> it's<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.720> what<00:03:11.900> was

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
I guess that's it's really that what was

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.530 
I guess that's it's really that what was
its<00:03:12.290> way<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.620> recovering<00:03:12.920> was<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.549> scar<00:03:13.850> now

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
its way of recovering was the scar now

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.240 
its way of recovering was the scar now
the<00:03:15.049> problem<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:15.380> that<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.769> did<00:03:15.890> recover

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
the problem with that is it did recover

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.009 
the problem with that is it did recover
and<00:03:16.489> look<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.940> same<00:03:17.180> that's<00:03:17.420> that's<00:03:17.780> where

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
and look the same that's that's where

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.470 
and look the same that's that's where
you<00:03:18.530> know<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.890> as<00:03:19.130> human<00:03:19.610> beings<00:03:19.640> look<00:03:20.239> at<00:03:20.360> it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you know we as human beings look at it

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.090 
you know we as human beings look at it

a<00:03:26.030> process<00:03:26.329> of<00:03:26.690> boosting<00:03:27.049> nutrition<00:03:27.530> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
a process of boosting nutrition and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.130

the<00:03:38.769> skin<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:39.890> isn't<00:03:40.160> scarred<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.690> break

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the skin that isn't scarred and to break

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.330 
the skin that isn't scarred and to break
that<00:03:42.019> down<00:03:42.079> and<00:03:42.350> then<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.590> rebuild<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.220> with

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
that down and then to rebuild that with

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.069 
that down and then to rebuild that with
new<00:03:43.459> collagen<00:03:43.940> production<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:44.870> why

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
new collagen production and that's why

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.449 
new collagen production and that's why
what's<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.380> scar<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.860> C<00:03:45.980> program<00:03:46.340> I'd

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
what's in the scar is that C program I'd

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.729 
what's in the scar is that C program I'd
talk<00:03:46.730> about<00:03:47.030> how<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.750> get<00:03:47.989> more<00:03:48.019> collagen

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
talk about how to get more collagen

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.320 
talk about how to get more collagen
production<00:03:48.890> with

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
production with

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.920 
production with
the<00:03:49.420> skin<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.500> while<00:03:51.100> you're<00:03:51.930> boosting

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
the skin so that while you're boosting

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.370 
the skin so that while you're boosting
their<00:03:53.230> nutrition<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.450> eating<00:03:55.450> things<00:03:56.320> that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
their nutrition and eating things that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.840 
their nutrition and eating things that
break<00:03:56.680> down<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> scars<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.550> make<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.760> more

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
break down the scars and make it more

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.870 
break down the scars and make it more
flexible<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.660> more<00:03:58.750> workable<00:03:59.200> if<00:03:59.440> you<00:03:59.590> will

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
flexible and more workable if you will

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.550 
flexible and more workable if you will
basically<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.420> cause<00:04:01.630> regression<00:04:02.110> ramps<00:04:02.440> up

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
basically the cause regression ramps up

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.320 
basically the cause regression ramps up
and<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:02.830> can<00:04:03.010> heal<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.520> fill<00:04:03.880> that<00:04:03.910> gap

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
and that can heal and fill that gap

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.970 
and that can heal and fill that gap
which<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.900> like<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.170> hole<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.590> your<00:04:05.620> skin

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
which is like the hole in your skin

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.860 
which is like the hole in your skin
Justice<00:04:06.790> Carl<00:04:07.030> when<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:07.390> mark<00:04:07.600> on<00:04:07.720> your<00:04:07.810> skin

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
Justice Carl when you mark on your skin

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.290 
Justice Carl when you mark on your skin
which<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.230> scar<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.310> diet<00:04:09.790> does<00:04:10.060> play<00:04:10.270> a

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
which is scar so diet does play a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.760 
which is scar so diet does play a
crucial<00:04:10.510> role<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.840> very<00:04:10.870> important<00:04:11.680> is

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
crucial role is very important is

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.130 
crucial role is very important is
