at home that's I think the most

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.000 
at home that's I think the most
important<00:00:44.960> thing<00:00:45.079> because<00:00:45.199> their<00:00:45.499> procedures

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
important thing because their procedures

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.789 
important thing because their procedures
are<00:00:46.249> quite<00:00:46.550> stressful<00:00:47.289> themselves<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:48.499> it's

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
are quite stressful themselves so it's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:51.669

nice when the environment and settings

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.250 
nice when the environment and settings
