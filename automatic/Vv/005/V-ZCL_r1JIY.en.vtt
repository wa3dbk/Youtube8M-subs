activities

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.080 
activities
I<00:00:09.630> think<00:00:10.349> programs<00:00:10.559> such<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.309> recognises

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
I think programs such as this recognises

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.669 
I think programs such as this recognises
that<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.269> community<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.840> very<00:00:12.929> important

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
that the community is very important

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.110 
that the community is very important
whether<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.160> at<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.519> level<00:00:14.580> state<00:00:15.000> high

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
whether it's at a level state high

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.930 
whether it's at a level state high
school<00:00:15.150> or<00:00:15.719> any<00:00:15.990> other<00:00:16.020> school<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.940> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
school or any other school but the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
school or any other school but the
connectedness<00:00:18.660> with<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.960> community<00:00:19.560> means

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
connectedness with the community means

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.679 
connectedness with the community means
that<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.400> should<00:00:20.430> improve<00:00:20.850> data<00:00:21.150> across<00:00:21.480> all

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that it should improve data across all

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.630 
that it should improve data across all
the<00:00:21.810> other<00:00:21.960> schools<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.430> there

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the other schools as well because there

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.019 
the other schools as well because there
was<00:00:23.869> connectedness<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.019> those<00:00:25.260> schools<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
was connectedness with those schools and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
was connectedness with those schools and
community<00:00:27.029> starts<00:00:27.420> participating<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
think we've rebuild a community with the
kids<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> football<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> school

in<00:00:55.440> our<00:00:55.649> parents<00:00:56.039> today<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.699> ideal<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
in our parents today is a ideal time to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.569 
in our parents today is a ideal time to
do<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.050> sort<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.859> programs<00:00:59.399> such

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
do that sort of thing in programs such

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
do that sort of thing in programs such
as<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.449> create<00:01:00.780> connectedness<00:01:01.320> shows

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
as this that create connectedness shows

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
as this that create connectedness shows
up<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> our<00:01:02.640> data<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.480> instance<00:01:04.019> our

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
up in our data so for instance our

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170 
up in our data so for instance our
attendance<00:01:04.619> data<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.580> certainly<00:01:05.939> see

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
attendance data and we certainly see

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.539 
attendance data and we certainly see
that<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> retaining<00:01:07.200> indigenous<00:01:08.070> students

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that in retaining indigenous students

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.149 
that in retaining indigenous students
within<00:01:08.970> our<00:01:09.210> schools<00:01:09.600> across<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.409> important

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
within our schools across some important

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
within our schools across some important
junctions<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.640> grade<00:01:11.970> 10<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> 11<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.869> we

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
junctions like grade 10 to 11 and we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
junctions like grade 10 to 11 and we
also<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.560> student<00:01:16.560> learning

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
also see if we like student learning

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.910 
also see if we like student learning
outcomes<00:01:17.280> data<00:01:17.520> improving<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.290> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
outcomes data improving and that is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
outcomes data improving and that is
because<00:01:20.280> students<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.820> feeling<00:01:21.060> connected

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
because students are feeling connected

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.600 
because students are feeling connected
