inside minecraft now last video is just
a<00:00:19.770> quick<00:00:19.800> bug<00:00:20.279> fix<00:00:20.580> episode<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.960> thought

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
a quick bug fix episode and I thought

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.890 
a quick bug fix episode and I thought
today<00:00:22.320> let's<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.550> doing<00:00:23.869> doing<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
today let's get on with doing doing the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
today let's get on with doing doing the
external<00:00:25.289> ramp<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.180> we'll

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
external ramp and so that's what we'll

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
external ramp and so that's what we'll
be<00:00:27.330> doing<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:28.230> won't<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.769> like

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
be doing we won't actually be like

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.730 
be doing we won't actually be like
installing<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.269> RAM<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.750> such<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.560> be

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
installing the RAM as such will just be

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.549 
installing the RAM as such will just be
a<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.460> through<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> design<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:34.350> one

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a going through the design of it of one

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.830 
a going through the design of it of one
individual<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.550> register<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> RAM<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
individual like register of the RAM and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
individual like register of the RAM and
then<00:00:37.800> next<00:00:38.100> video<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:38.670> show<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> where

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
then next video I will show you where

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.420 
then next video I will show you where
box<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.140> need<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:41.010> video

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
box we need to put it and then video

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.799 
box we need to put it and then video
after<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.700> before<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.940> link<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
after that before we link it all up and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
after that before we link it all up and
then<00:00:43.350> we're<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.710> finished<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.340> gonna<00:00:44.489> do

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
then we're about finished just gonna do

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.000 
then we're about finished just gonna do
a<00:00:44.700> bit<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> ROM<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> program<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
a bit of ROM for the program bit of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.490 
a bit of ROM for the program bit of
input/output<00:00:47.670> bit<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> branching<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.350> yeah

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
input/output bit of branching so yeah

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
input/output bit of branching so yeah
there<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> still<00:00:50.219> feel<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:50.910> projects<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> do

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there is still feel at projects to do

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
there is still feel at projects to do
but<00:00:51.690> we're<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.410> completing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but we're well on the way to completing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.110 
but we're well on the way to completing
this<00:00:53.100> computer<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> yeah<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.789> in<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
this computer so yeah in in one of the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
this computer so yeah in in one of the
previous<00:00:57.360> episodes<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.260> built<00:00:58.530> these

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
previous episodes we built these

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.680 
previous episodes we built these
registers<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> general-purpose<00:01:00.329> registers

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
registers the general-purpose registers

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840 
registers the general-purpose registers
which<00:01:01.289> are<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.530> dual<00:01:01.949> read<00:01:02.190> which<00:01:02.430> means<00:01:02.670> they

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
which are all dual read which means they

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
which are all dual read which means they
have<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.359> location<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> write<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
have one location you can write to so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
have one location you can write to so
like<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.479> read<00:01:06.750> from

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
like here but then you can read from

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
like here but then you can read from
them<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.260> two<00:01:07.500> places<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.490> gives<00:01:08.700> us<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
them from two places which gives us the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.560 
them from two places which gives us the
two<00:01:09.180> inputs<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> our<00:01:10.110> ALU<00:01:10.909> now<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> RAM<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
two inputs to our ALU now the RAM is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.690 
two inputs to our ALU now the RAM is
only<00:01:12.990> single<00:01:13.409> read<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.070> much<00:01:14.340> simpler

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
only single read so it's much simpler

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.090 
only single read so it's much simpler
than<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.840> easier<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.259> build<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
than this and much easier to build so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
than this and much easier to build so
let's<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.310> straight<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:19.080> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
let's get straight into it so first of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.830 
let's get straight into it so first of
all<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> three<00:01:20.580> blocks<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.119> our<00:01:21.450> input

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
all we have three blocks for our input

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
all we have three blocks for our input
line<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.920> needs<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.520> inverted<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.960> we'll

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
line which needs to be inverted so we'll

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
line which needs to be inverted so we'll
just<00:01:25.229> place<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.590> such<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.790> we

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
just place that such there and then we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.960 
just place that such there and then we
comes<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> middle<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.630> our<00:01:27.750> three<00:01:27.960> blocks

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
comes the middle one of our three blocks

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
comes the middle one of our three blocks
place<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> piston<00:01:30.390> facing<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.860> which

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
place a piston facing down like so which

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
place a piston facing down like so which
will<00:01:32.369> extend<00:01:32.610> automatically<00:01:33.479> due<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
will extend automatically due to this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.840 
will extend automatically due to this
being<00:01:34.470> powered<00:01:35.180> after<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.720> place<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
being powered after that we just place a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.130 
being powered after that we just place a
block<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.090> redstone<00:01:39.329> redstone<00:01:39.750> block

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
block of redstone redstone block

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.999 
block of redstone redstone block
underneath<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.340> under<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.290> we<00:01:43.290> need<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
underneath it then under that we need to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
underneath it then under that we need to
make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.060> redstone<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
make sure that this redstone here is

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.300 
make sure that this redstone here is
being<00:01:45.990> powered<00:01:46.500> by<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.880> block<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.329> redstone

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
being powered by this block of redstone

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.090 
being powered by this block of redstone
next<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.360> fairly<00:01:51.899> simple<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.009> can

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
next this is a fairly simple as you can

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.780 
next this is a fairly simple as you can
see<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.430> place<00:01:53.820> another<00:01:55.520> piston<00:01:56.520> sticky

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
see we just place another piston sticky

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.490 
see we just place another piston sticky
piston<00:01:57.090> both<00:01:57.390> these<00:01:57.540> sticky<00:01:57.840> pistons<00:01:58.170> under

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
piston both these sticky pistons under

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
piston both these sticky pistons under
that<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.610> replace<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.360> block<00:02:00.689> under<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that and then replace a block under that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
that and then replace a block under that
like<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.490> there

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
like that that's just there

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
like that that's just there
times<00:02:04.020> such<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.620> day<00:02:06.350> right<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.369> our

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
times such a day right so that is our

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
times such a day right so that is our
right<00:02:09.330> system<00:02:09.990> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.350> our<00:02:10.440> memory<00:02:10.770> cell<00:02:10.950> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
right system this is our memory cell so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
right system this is our memory cell so
if<00:02:11.490> I<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.910> show<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> mean<00:02:12.600> by<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
if I just show you what I mean by that

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
if I just show you what I mean by that
grab<00:02:14.040> some<00:02:14.870> corn<00:02:15.870> nope<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.320> remember<00:02:16.860> I'm<00:02:16.980> using

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
grab some corn nope I remember I'm using

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.070 
grab some corn nope I remember I'm using
stones<00:02:17.520> lobster<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.240> if<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.480> place<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
stones lobster this one so if we place a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.100 
stones lobster this one so if we place a
little<00:02:22.320> I'm<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.660> big<00:02:24.660> disks

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
little I'm going like that big disks

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.360 
little I'm going like that big disks
like<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:27.140> button<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:29.190> can

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
like this and then a button there we can

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430 
like this and then a button there we can
see<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.390> our<00:02:30.510> input<00:02:30.690> if<00:02:31.020> we<00:02:31.140> want<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
see that this is our input if we want to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.220 
see that this is our input if we want to
save<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.790> enter<00:02:33.270> some<00:02:33.420> data<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.110> that's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
save a one we enter some data so that's

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.620 
save a one we enter some data so that's
a<00:02:34.290> one<00:02:34.470> coming<00:02:34.770> through<00:02:34.890> click<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:36.420> its

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
a one coming through click on and as its

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.540 
a one coming through click on and as its
inverted<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.440> off<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.890> they<00:02:38.310> will<00:02:38.400> click

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
inverted this is off and they will click

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.240 
inverted this is off and they will click
this<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.360> writes<00:02:39.840> into<00:02:40.080> memory<00:02:40.470> now

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
this and this writes into memory now

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.190 
this and this writes into memory now
this<00:02:41.520> piston<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.090> retracted<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:45.200> input

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
this piston is retracted and the input

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.780 
this piston is retracted and the input
does<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.709> affect<00:02:47.010> what<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.220> starting<00:02:47.610> here

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
does not affect what is starting here

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.970 
does not affect what is starting here
and<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.420> if<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.690> send<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.990> 0<00:02:49.230> through<00:02:49.590> which<00:02:49.860> is

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
and then if we send a 0 through which is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.040 
and then if we send a 0 through which is
then<00:02:50.100> inverted<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.730> become<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> 1<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.510> write

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
then inverted to become a 1 and write

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.270 
then inverted to become a 1 and write
that<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:53.670> thing<00:02:53.880> we<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.090> retracted<00:02:54.510> again

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
that this thing we was retracted again

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.900 
that this thing we was retracted again
extended<00:02:56.280> again<00:02:56.490> sorry

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
extended again sorry

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.940 
extended again sorry
and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:58.020> not<00:02:58.140> affect<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.740> memory

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and then this does not affect the memory

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.210 
and then this does not affect the memory
cell<00:02:59.100> this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> bud<00:03:00.480> which<00:03:01.230> air<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.920> just<00:03:02.100> use

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
cell this is a bud which air we just use

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.740 
cell this is a bud which air we just use
this<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.970> input<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
this as the input and then this to

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.580 
this as the input and then this to
update<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.110> bud<00:03:05.000> which<00:03:06.080> which<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.260> controls

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
update the bud which which just controls

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.290 
update the bud which which just controls
this<00:03:07.680> piston<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.790> person<00:03:09.090> obviously

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
this piston and this person obviously

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.020 
this piston and this person obviously
controls<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.140> piston<00:03:10.440> here<00:03:10.880> which<00:03:11.880> will

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
controls this piston here which will

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.050 
controls this piston here which will
extend<00:03:12.300> after<00:03:12.810> 2<00:03:12.959> ticks<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.100> yeah<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.400> now<00:03:15.000> we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
extend after 2 ticks so yeah and now we

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.850 
extend after 2 ticks so yeah and now we
need<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.720> come<00:03:15.930> out<00:03:16.130> like<00:03:17.130> that<00:03:17.959> place<00:03:18.959> ad<00:03:19.650> this

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
need to come out like that place ad this

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.770 
need to come out like that place ad this
is<00:03:19.920> gonna<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> bit<00:03:20.670> tricky<00:03:21.120> iPhone<00:03:21.570> just

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
is gonna be a bit tricky iPhone just

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.900 
is gonna be a bit tricky iPhone just
realize<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.200> let's<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.830> into<00:03:22.980> fear<00:03:23.220> my

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
realize that let's put it into fear my

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.410 
realize that let's put it into fear my
bad

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
bad

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.300 
bad
so<00:03:24.810> we<00:03:24.989> need<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.200> place<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:26.580> like<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.940> like

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.000 

that<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.750> then<00:03:33.750> join<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.890> up<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.739> now<00:03:37.739> if

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
that and then join it up like so now if

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.590 
that and then join it up like so now if
we<00:03:38.040> come<00:03:38.340> right<00:03:38.640> down<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> bottom<00:03:39.120> we're

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
we come right down to the bottom we're

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.960 
we come right down to the bottom we're
almost<00:03:39.750> done

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
almost done

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.370 
almost done
do<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> little<00:03:42.150> diagonal<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.880> place<00:03:45.380> to

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
do a little diagonal like so place to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.780 
do a little diagonal like so place to
like<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.570> race<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.750> touch<00:03:48.930> on<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.200> one

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
like that race and touch on this one

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.250 
like that race and touch on this one
redstone<00:03:50.790> here<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.180> then<00:03:51.540> written<00:03:52.080> here<00:03:52.200> in

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
redstone here and then written here in

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.610 
redstone here and then written here in
here<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.760> while<00:03:53.760> that<00:03:53.880> we<00:03:54.120> are<00:03:54.360> finished<00:03:54.630> so

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
here and while that we are finished so

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.490 
here and while that we are finished so
now<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.190> say<00:03:56.550> this<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.480> right<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.290> read

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
now if I say this is the right the read

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.070 
now if I say this is the right the read
we<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.519> demonstrate<00:03:59.790> what<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.510> going<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:00.900> here

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
we can demonstrate what is going on here

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.280 
we can demonstrate what is going on here
ok<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.940> at<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.060> moment<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.900> need<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.110> ignite

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
ok so at the moment you need to ignite

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.900 
ok so at the moment you need to ignite
arch<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.860> look<00:04:05.310> at<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.459> lever<00:04:05.640> at<00:04:05.880> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
arch just look at the lever at the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.930 
arch just look at the lever at the
moment<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.450> lever<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.810> off<00:04:07.670> we<00:04:08.670> write

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
moment this lever is off we write

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.480 
moment this lever is off we write
something<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.570> we<00:04:10.230> write<00:04:10.440> in<00:04:10.530> 0<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:11.190> nothing

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
something to it we write in 0 so nothing

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.490 
something to it we write in 0 so nothing
changes<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> memory<00:04:12.300> cell<00:04:12.450> then<00:04:13.110> we<00:04:13.290> read

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
changes in the memory cell then we read

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.319 
changes in the memory cell then we read
it

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
it

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.390 
it
and<00:04:16.329> we<00:04:16.720> get<00:04:16.900> no<00:04:17.169> output<00:04:17.739> because<00:04:17.980> nothing<00:04:18.310> has

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and we get no output because nothing has

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.210 
and we get no output because nothing has
been<00:04:18.430> starting<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:19.120> then<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.410> we<00:04:20.590> input<00:04:21.100> some

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
been starting here then if we input some

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.659 
been starting here then if we input some
data<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.680> address<00:04:24.250> or<00:04:24.460> this

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
data right it's of this address or this

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.460 
data right it's of this address or this
register<00:04:25.180> then<00:04:25.900> read<00:04:26.110> it

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
register then read it

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.290 
register then read it
kapow<00:04:27.430> we<00:04:27.970> have<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.810> output<00:04:29.970> then<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.120> don't

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
kapow we have a output then we don't

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.670 
kapow we have a output then we don't
read<00:04:31.620> read<00:04:32.620> read<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:33.850> on<00:04:34.000> so<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.360> on<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:34.810> yeah

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
read read read so on so on so on so yeah

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.560 
read read read so on so on so on so yeah
this<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.310> fairly<00:04:36.550> simple<00:04:36.790> since<00:04:37.270> this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
this is this is fairly simple since this

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.320 
this is this is fairly simple since this
retraction<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.650> piston<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.250> instant<00:04:40.180> and

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
retraction of the piston is instant and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.020 
retraction of the piston is instant and
we<00:04:40.870> only<00:04:40.990> able<00:04:41.139> one<00:04:41.410> tick<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:42.250> delay<00:04:42.580> here<00:04:42.820> this

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
we only able one tick of delay here this

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.280 
we only able one tick of delay here this
is<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> wanta<00:04:43.780> Creed

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
is a wanta Creed

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.140 
is a wanta Creed
so<00:04:44.740> once<00:04:44.919> it's<00:04:45.040> been<00:04:45.160> saved<00:04:45.460> don't<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:46.030> one

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
so once it's been saved don't it's one

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.420 
so once it's been saved don't it's one
thing<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.630> read<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.380> data<00:04:47.560> from<00:04:47.830> carousel

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
thing to read the data from carousel

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.110 
thing to read the data from carousel
this<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.660> probably<00:04:50.400> hope<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.669> also<00:04:51.850> very

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
this is probably hope this is also very

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.400 
this is probably hope this is also very
nice<00:04:52.270> as<00:04:52.450> well<00:04:52.600> since<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.900> only<00:04:53.020> have<00:04:53.110> one

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
nice as well since we only have one

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.310 
nice as well since we only have one
piston<00:04:54.400> going<00:04:54.639> into<00:04:54.970> this<00:04:55.090> block<00:04:55.300> oh<00:04:55.600> yeah<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
piston going into this block oh yeah I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.740 
piston going into this block oh yeah I
need<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> fix<00:04:56.740> this<00:04:56.860> because<00:04:57.160> that<00:04:57.280> actually

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
need to fix this because that actually

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.650 
need to fix this because that actually
misses<00:04:58.750> wrong<00:04:58.930> with<00:04:59.050> this<00:04:59.669> hmm<00:05:00.669> okay<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:01.419> yeah

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
misses wrong with this hmm okay so yeah

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.600 
misses wrong with this hmm okay so yeah
I<00:05:01.900> remember<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.800> need<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.070> do<00:05:03.190> some<00:05:03.370> bug<00:05:03.580> fixes

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
I remember I need to do some bug fixes

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.580 
I remember I need to do some bug fixes
in<00:05:04.090> here<00:05:04.270> see<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.750> is<00:05:04.900> also<00:05:05.020> one<00:05:05.260> tick<00:05:05.500> delay

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
in here see this is also one tick delay

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.629 
in here see this is also one tick delay
at<00:05:05.979> once<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.340> reads<00:05:06.520> sorry<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.139> then<00:05:08.139> it<00:05:08.639> it

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
at once it reads sorry and then it it

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.310 
at once it reads sorry and then it it
goes<00:05:09.850> down<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.389> think<00:05:10.570> again<00:05:10.840> that's<00:05:11.050> once

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
goes down and I think again that's once

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.100 
goes down and I think again that's once
agreed<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.800> might<00:05:12.130> be<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.550> bit<00:05:13.300> slower<00:05:13.780> than<00:05:14.050> that

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
agreed I might be a bit slower than that

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.140 
agreed I might be a bit slower than that
but<00:05:14.620> yeah<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:15.220> usually<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.639> which<00:05:15.790> you'll<00:05:15.970> read

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
but yeah it usually is which you'll read

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.200 
but yeah it usually is which you'll read
so<00:05:16.840> that<00:05:16.960> is<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.260> design<00:05:17.620> for<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.639> video<00:05:19.000> and

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
so that is the design for this video and

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.320 
so that is the design for this video and
now<00:05:20.220> there's<00:05:21.220> not<00:05:21.310> much<00:05:21.490> left<00:05:21.639> to<00:05:21.700> do<00:05:21.910> it's

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
now there's not much left to do it's

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.960 
now there's not much left to do it's
pretty<00:05:22.630> basic<00:05:22.810> design<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.650> we<00:05:23.889> will<00:05:24.039> take

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
pretty basic design and we will take

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.180 
pretty basic design and we will take
this<00:05:25.450> which<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:25.930> hold<00:05:26.110> one<00:05:26.320> bit<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.650> then<00:05:27.039> we

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
this which in hold one bit and then we

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.640 
this which in hold one bit and then we
will<00:05:27.220> stuck<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:28.770> across<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:30.070> get<00:05:30.280> eight

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
will stuck it across to get eight

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.680 
will stuck it across to get eight
imagine<00:05:32.650> nuts<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:33.100> top<00:05:33.490> three<00:05:33.880> because<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.240> can

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
imagine nuts a top three because I can

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.020 
imagine nuts a top three because I can
actually<00:05:35.020> count<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.500> then<00:05:36.340> we<00:05:36.639> will<00:05:36.789> take

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
actually count and then we will take

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.090 
actually count and then we will take
this<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.510> then<00:05:38.080> we<00:05:38.200> will<00:05:38.229> stuck<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.710> in<00:05:38.800> this

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
this and then we will stuck it in this

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.100 
this and then we will stuck it in this
direction<00:05:39.310> lots<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.479> lots<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:40.780> lots<00:05:40.870> of

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
direction lots and lots and lots of

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.340 
direction lots and lots and lots of
times<00:05:41.410> together<00:05:42.479> multiple<00:05:43.479> addresses<00:05:43.930> and

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
times together multiple addresses and

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.590 
times together multiple addresses and
that<00:05:44.979> will<00:05:45.100> form<00:05:45.310> our<00:05:45.460> ramp<00:05:45.789> this<00:05:46.180> will<00:05:46.419> then

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
that will form our ramp this will then

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.360 
that will form our ramp this will then
be<00:05:46.660> placed<00:05:47.139> all<00:05:47.440> using<00:05:47.710> will<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:48.010> of<00:05:48.130> course

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
be placed all using will that of course

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.469 
be placed all using will that of course
as<00:05:49.120> close<00:05:49.510> as<00:05:49.690> we<00:05:49.780> can<00:05:49.900> get<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.229> to<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:51.479> two

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
as close as we can get it to the two

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.090 
as close as we can get it to the two
here<00:05:52.690> so<00:05:52.990> it's<00:05:53.110> probably<00:05:53.560> gonna<00:05:53.740> be<00:05:53.830> wall

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
here so it's probably gonna be wall

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.070 
here so it's probably gonna be wall
might<00:05:54.430> sort<00:05:54.639> of<00:05:54.700> look<00:05:54.850> just<00:05:55.630> stick<00:05:55.750> out<00:05:55.960> one

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
might sort of look just stick out one

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.529 
might sort of look just stick out one
more<00:05:56.260> yes<00:05:56.470> this<00:05:56.650> sticks<00:05:56.919> up<00:05:57.070> one<00:05:57.280> more<00:05:57.520> so<00:05:58.330> we

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
more yes this sticks up one more so we

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.190 
more yes this sticks up one more so we
go<00:05:58.690> inside<00:05:58.810> probably<00:05:59.470> placed<00:05:59.710> here<00:06:01.200> extending

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
go inside probably placed here extending

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.589 
go inside probably placed here extending
extending<00:06:03.070> so<00:06:03.220> all<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.789> way<00:06:03.880> down<00:06:04.090> here<00:06:04.330> to

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
extending so all the way down here to

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.180 
extending so all the way down here to
around<00:06:04.840> here<00:06:05.080> and<00:06:05.260> then<00:06:05.680> all<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:05.950> it<00:06:06.010> on<00:06:06.130> the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
around here and then all of it on the

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.800 
around here and then all of it on the
other<00:06:06.280> side<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.849> then<00:06:07.360> we<00:06:07.419> have<00:06:07.450> to<00:06:07.660> have<00:06:07.750> a

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
other side and then we have to have a

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.810 
other side and then we have to have a
massive<00:06:08.200> binary<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.889> decimal<00:06:08.919> decoder<00:06:09.520> which

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
massive binary to decimal decoder which

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.219 
massive binary to decimal decoder which
I<00:06:09.940> will<00:06:10.090> provide<00:06:10.270> schematic<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:10.990> at<00:06:11.050> some

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
I will provide schematic for at some

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.020 
I will provide schematic for at some
point<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:12.010> I'm<00:06:12.190> behind<00:06:12.370> on<00:06:12.610> uploading

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
point and I'm behind on uploading

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.310 
point and I'm behind on uploading
schematics<00:06:13.210> I<00:06:13.660> need<00:06:13.780> to<00:06:13.900> do<00:06:14.050> some<00:06:14.229> of<00:06:14.289> that

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
schematics I need to do some of that

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.830 
schematics I need to do some of that
soon<00:06:14.830> and<00:06:15.240> yeah<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.419> will<00:06:16.539> form<00:06:16.810> the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
soon and yeah that will form the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.010 
soon and yeah that will form the
dressing<00:06:17.320> and<00:06:17.669> then<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:18.880> address<00:06:19.150> which<00:06:19.750> is

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
dressing and then the address which is

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.920 
dressing and then the address which is
coming<00:06:20.229> out<00:06:20.380> of<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.560> orig<00:06:20.860> -<00:06:21.099> will<00:06:21.310> feed<00:06:21.550> into

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
coming out of the orig - will feed into

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.810 
coming out of the orig - will feed into
that<00:06:22.930> decoder<00:06:23.440> yeah<00:06:24.099> it's<00:06:24.280> all<00:06:24.490> going<00:06:24.669> to<00:06:24.760> be

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
that decoder yeah it's all going to be

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.270 
that decoder yeah it's all going to be
super<00:06:25.240> nice<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.659> super<00:06:26.140> compact<00:06:26.740> super<00:06:27.070> fast

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
super nice and super compact super fast

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.920 
super nice and super compact super fast
and<00:06:27.580> hopefully<00:06:28.419> this<00:06:28.570> will<00:06:28.659> be

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
and hopefully this will be

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.570 
and hopefully this will be
