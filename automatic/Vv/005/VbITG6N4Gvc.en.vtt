00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that bringing that down on the bottom

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.400 
that bringing that down on the bottom
here<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:46.000> gave<00:02:46.390> them<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.810> choice<00:02:47.019> to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:04:00.270 

we<00:03:49.900> can<00:03:50.080> draw<00:03:50.290> this<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.710> in<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.920> same<00:03:51.160> way<00:03:59.280> and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
we can draw this in in the same way and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:10.410 
we can draw this in in the same way and
of<00:04:00.490> course<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:01.810> equity<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:09.070> so<00:04:09.550> now<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:09.880> see

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
of course the equity and so now you see

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.360 
of course the equity and so now you see
this<00:04:10.630> thing<00:04:10.960> looks<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.830> little<00:04:11.980> bit<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
this thing looks a little bit like a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.760 
this thing looks a little bit like a
fence<00:04:12.760> doesn't<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.300> this<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.290> course<00:04:14.320> is<00:04:14.710> a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
fence doesn't it this of course is a

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
you got there this is the kind of thing

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.110 
you got there this is the kind of thing
that<00:04:44.110> George<00:04:44.470> was<00:04:44.680> looking<00:04:45.010> for<00:04:45.250> because<00:04:45.880> he

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
that George was looking for because he

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.360 
that George was looking for because he
wasn't<00:04:46.330> looking<00:04:46.600> just<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.200> work<00:04:47.830> work<00:04:48.130> work

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
wasn't looking just a work work work

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.270 
wasn't looking just a work work work
work<00:04:48.610> work<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.210> never<00:04:49.420> get<00:04:49.720> anywhere<00:04:50.280> but

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
work work and never get anywhere but

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.580 
work work and never get anywhere but
somehow<00:04:51.640> he<00:04:51.910> needed<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.540> commit<00:04:53.050> everything

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
somehow he needed to commit everything

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.909 
somehow he needed to commit everything
up<00:04:53.890> and<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.480> way<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.230> connects<00:04:56.800> up

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
up and so the way that this connects up

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.800 
up and so the way that this connects up
of<00:04:57.100> course<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.610> when<00:04:58.360> you<00:04:58.600> accumulate<00:04:59.230> capital

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
of course is when you accumulate capital

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.970 
of course is when you accumulate capital
it<00:05:01.810> ends<00:05:02.290> up<00:05:02.620> here<00:05:03.900> when<00:05:04.900> you<00:05:05.169> pay<00:05:05.500> for<00:05:05.800> things

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
it ends up here when you pay for things

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.220 
it ends up here when you pay for things
yourself<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:08.620> ends<00:05:09.160> up<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.640> and<00:05:10.020> when<00:05:11.020> you

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
yourself it ends up here and when you

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.140 
yourself it ends up here and when you
use<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.890> bed<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:14.080> end<00:05:14.290> up<00:05:14.470> there<00:05:14.940> one<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.060> the

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
use the bed you end up there one of the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.720 
use the bed you end up there one of the
things<00:05:16.419> that<00:05:16.540> George<00:05:17.050> had<00:05:17.350> realized<00:05:17.890> is<00:05:18.250> that

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
things that George had realized is that

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.600 
things that George had realized is that
if<00:05:19.510> he<00:05:20.020> had<00:05:20.290> all<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.530> this<00:05:20.800> debt<00:05:21.040> on<00:05:21.220> board<00:05:21.520> he

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
if he had all of this debt on board he

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.960 
if he had all of this debt on board he
wasn't<00:05:22.030> really<00:05:22.270> wealthy<00:05:22.690> in<00:05:23.430> fact<00:05:24.430> he<00:05:24.610> felt

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
wasn't really wealthy in fact he felt

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.000 
wasn't really wealthy in fact he felt
like<00:05:25.060> an<00:05:25.360> imposter<00:05:25.870> in<00:05:26.020> fact<00:05:26.230> he<00:05:26.380> knew<00:05:26.650> he<00:05:26.800> was

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
like an imposter in fact he knew he was

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.120 
like an imposter in fact he knew he was
an<00:05:27.130> imposter<00:05:27.990> because<00:05:28.990> he<00:05:29.200> thought<00:05:29.500> that<00:05:29.560> if

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
an imposter because he thought that if

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.600 
an imposter because he thought that if
I've<00:05:30.850> got<00:05:31.090> all<00:05:31.330> of<00:05:31.480> this<00:05:31.660> stuff<00:05:32.260> I'll<00:05:32.620> be

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
I've got all of this stuff I'll be

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.150 
I've got all of this stuff I'll be
wealthy<00:05:34.090> and<00:05:34.470> there<00:05:35.470> are<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.620> whole<00:05:35.800> bunch<00:05:35.830> of

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
wealthy and there are a whole bunch of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.550 
wealthy and there are a whole bunch of
people<00:05:36.220> out<00:05:36.580> there<00:05:36.820> who<00:05:37.240> look<00:05:37.600> really<00:05:38.320> wealthy

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
people out there who look really wealthy

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.909 
people out there who look really wealthy
because<00:05:39.370> what<00:05:39.820> we<00:05:40.300> all<00:05:40.540> look<00:05:40.810> at<00:05:40.990> is<00:05:41.290> what<00:05:41.650> they

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
because what we all look at is what they

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.140 
because what we all look at is what they
have<00:05:43.410> not<00:05:44.410> how<00:05:45.040> they<00:05:45.340> paid<00:05:45.700> for<00:05:45.730> it<00:05:46.380> an

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
have not how they paid for it an

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.190 
have not how they paid for it an
interesting<00:05:49.150> thought<00:05:49.360> of<00:05:49.540> course<00:05:49.750> would<00:05:50.169> be

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
interesting thought of course would be

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.250 
interesting thought of course would be
that<00:05:50.620> if<00:05:50.800> every<00:05:51.790> car<00:05:52.180> had<00:05:52.630> a<00:05:52.660> debt-equity

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
that if every car had a debt-equity

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.190 
that if every car had a debt-equity
indicator<00:05:54.190> we<00:05:55.180> might<00:05:55.390> find<00:05:55.720> that<00:05:55.840> a<00:05:55.990> lot<00:05:56.140> of

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
indicator we might find that a lot of

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.900 
indicator we might find that a lot of
the<00:05:56.290> cars<00:05:56.620> driving<00:05:57.130> around<00:05:57.310> on<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.700> roads

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
the cars driving around on the roads

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.770 
the cars driving around on the roads
don't<00:05:58.300> belong<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.110> people<00:05:59.260> dry

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
don't belong to the people dry

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.230 
don't belong to the people dry
them<00:06:00.050> they<00:06:00.620> actually<00:06:00.860> belong<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.730> finance

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
them they actually belong to a finance

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.140 
them they actually belong to a finance
company<00:06:02.950> what<00:06:03.950> we<00:06:04.100> might<00:06:04.280> find<00:06:04.340> if<00:06:04.850> there<00:06:05.030> was

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
company what we might find if there was

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.390 
company what we might find if there was
a<00:06:05.180> dead<00:06:05.480> equity<00:06:05.930> indicator<00:06:06.440> on<00:06:06.560> every<00:06:07.160> letter

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
a dead equity indicator on every letter

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.570 
a dead equity indicator on every letter
box<00:06:07.700> a<00:06:08.000> lot<00:06:08.480> of<00:06:08.510> the<00:06:08.660> houses<00:06:09.260> in<00:06:09.500> this<00:06:10.100> nation

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
box a lot of the houses in this nation

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.730 
box a lot of the houses in this nation
actually<00:06:11.060> belonged<00:06:11.389> to<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.690> bank<00:06:11.960> they<00:06:12.560> don't

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
actually belonged to the bank they don't

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.379 
actually belonged to the bank they don't
actually<00:06:12.919> belonged<00:06:13.520> to<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.820> person<00:06:14.210> who's

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
actually belonged to the person who's

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.560 
actually belonged to the person who's
got<00:06:14.660> their<00:06:14.810> name<00:06:15.050> written<00:06:15.290> on<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:15.560> title<00:06:15.980> and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
got their name written on the title and

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.050 
got their name written on the title and
so<00:06:17.570> this<00:06:18.290> their<00:06:18.800> equity<00:06:19.280> thing<00:06:19.550> there<00:06:19.880> is

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
so this their equity thing there is

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.850 
so this their equity thing there is
another<00:06:20.389> term<00:06:20.750> that<00:06:20.810> goes<00:06:21.169> around<00:06:21.380> it's

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
another term that goes around it's

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.250 
another term that goes around it's
called<00:06:22.419> eighty<00:06:23.419> percent<00:06:25.210> loan-to-value

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
called eighty percent loan-to-value

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.370 
called eighty percent loan-to-value
ratio<00:06:27.730> what<00:06:28.730> that<00:06:28.940> means<00:06:29.240> is<00:06:29.540> that<00:06:29.570> a<00:06:29.900> bank

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
the value of that home of that

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.590 
the value of that home of that
investment<00:06:38.120> property<00:06:39.130> another<00:06:40.130> way<00:06:40.370> of

investment property another way of

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.720 
investment property another way of
saying<00:06:41.600> that<00:06:41.870> of<00:06:41.990> course<00:06:42.140> is<00:06:42.410> that<00:06:42.550> you<00:06:43.550> would

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
saying that of course is that you would

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.200 
saying that of course is that you would
have<00:06:43.910> four<00:06:44.720> parts<00:06:45.230> debt<00:06:45.590> for<00:06:46.100> every<00:06:46.220> one<00:06:46.820> part

have four parts debt for every one part

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.750 
have four parts debt for every one part
of<00:06:47.360> equity<00:06:48.250> so<00:06:49.250> eighty<00:06:49.610> percent

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
of equity so eighty percent

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.719 
of equity so eighty percent
loan-to-value<00:06:50.690> ratio<00:06:51.530> means<00:06:51.830> that<00:06:52.070> you<00:06:52.340> if

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:52.729 
loan-to-value ratio means that you if

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.510 
loan-to-value ratio means that you if
you<00:06:52.970> are<00:06:53.240> borrowing<00:06:53.570> on<00:06:53.930> that<00:06:54.140> basis<00:06:54.620> have<00:06:55.250> got

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
you are borrowing on that basis have got

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.060 
you are borrowing on that basis have got
four<00:06:55.940> dollars<00:06:56.360> of<00:06:56.510> debt<00:06:56.750> for<00:06:57.530> every<00:06:57.620> one

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
four dollars of debt for every one

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.090 
four dollars of debt for every one
dollar<00:06:58.310> of<00:06:58.610> equity<00:06:59.030> and<00:06:59.740> expressed<00:07:00.740> in<00:07:00.919> those

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
dollar of equity and expressed in those

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.540 
dollar of equity and expressed in those
terms<00:07:01.460> it<00:07:02.240> sounds<00:07:02.990> like<00:07:03.050> a<00:07:03.470> very<00:07:04.070> different

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
terms it sounds like a very different

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.990 
terms it sounds like a very different
picture<00:07:04.700> in<00:07:05.060> fact<00:07:05.330> George<00:07:05.660> had<00:07:06.080> realized<00:07:06.530> that

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
picture in fact George had realized that

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.880 
picture in fact George had realized that
George<00:07:08.000> had<00:07:08.180> realized<00:07:08.630> that<00:07:08.810> in<00:07:09.080> accessing

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
George had realized that in accessing

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.280 
George had realized that in accessing
the<00:07:10.160> equity<00:07:10.550> in<00:07:10.669> his<00:07:10.820> home<00:07:11.060> he<00:07:11.870> was<00:07:12.050> not

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
the equity in his home he was not

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.190 
the equity in his home he was not
getting<00:07:12.530> any<00:07:12.800> further<00:07:13.100> ahead<00:07:13.310> and<00:07:13.990> I<00:07:14.990> guess

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
getting any further ahead and I guess

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.650 
getting any further ahead and I guess
the<00:07:15.410> net<00:07:15.650> thing<00:07:15.979> for<00:07:16.190> George<00:07:16.460> after<00:07:17.450> all<00:07:17.630> of

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
the net thing for George after all of

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.710 
the net thing for George after all of
this<00:07:17.960> journey<00:07:18.350> was<00:07:18.650> he<00:07:19.520> realized<00:07:20.060> that<00:07:20.390> he

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
this journey was he realized that he

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.710 
this journey was he realized that he
needed<00:07:20.750> some<00:07:21.260> education<00:07:21.970> he<00:07:22.970> realized<00:07:23.450> that

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
needed some education he realized that

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.900 
needed some education he realized that
things<00:07:23.900> weren't<00:07:24.200> quite<00:07:24.350> as<00:07:24.590> simple<00:07:24.979> as<00:07:25.400> he

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910 
things weren't quite as simple as he

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.300 
things weren't quite as simple as he
thought<00:07:26.150> they<00:07:26.330> were<00:07:26.360> and<00:07:26.750> he<00:07:27.680> realized<00:07:28.130> that

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
thought they were and he realized that

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.130 
thought they were and he realized that
if<00:07:28.520> he<00:07:28.669> didn't<00:07:29.000> get<00:07:29.090> to<00:07:29.270> understand<00:07:29.870> all<00:07:30.110> of

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140 
if he didn't get to understand all of
