00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
going to demonstrate today how to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
going to demonstrate today how to
balance<00:00:20.250> your<00:00:20.849> skeleton<00:00:21.630> right<00:00:22.349> through<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
balance your skeleton right through the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.589 
balance your skeleton right through the
center<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.099> itself<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.820> we'll<00:00:24.029> talk<00:00:24.540> about

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
center of itself so we'll talk about

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.749 
center of itself so we'll talk about
we'll<00:00:25.169> show<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.619> how<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> balance<00:00:26.340> through

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
we'll show you how to balance through

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.760 
we'll show you how to balance through
the<00:00:26.790> center<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.270> yourself<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.810> standing<00:00:28.290> but

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
the center of yourself for standing but

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.290 
the center of yourself for standing but
then<00:00:28.890> we'll<00:00:29.040> also<00:00:29.160> show<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.579> how<00:00:29.700> to<00:00:29.970> walk

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
then we'll also show you how to walk

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.269 
then we'll also show you how to walk
with<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.020> how<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.560> translate<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
with that and how you translate that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.690 
with that and how you translate that
centered<00:00:33.030> balance<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:34.020> running<00:00:34.470> as<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
centered balance into running as well so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
centered balance into running as well so
the<00:00:36.060> first<00:00:36.270> thing<00:00:36.450> we're<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> do<00:00:37.110> here

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the first thing we're going to do here

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
the first thing we're going to do here
is<00:00:37.470> we're<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> ask<00:00:38.010> Kay<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:39.149> go<00:00:39.300> ahead

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
is we're going to ask Kay to go ahead

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.709 
is we're going to ask Kay to go ahead
and<00:00:39.720> first<00:00:39.960> drop<00:00:40.410> her<00:00:40.680> chest<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.719> releasing

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and first drop her chest down releasing

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
and first drop her chest down releasing
the<00:00:43.019> belly<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.879> that<00:00:44.879> starts<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> release<00:00:45.629> her

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the belly and that starts to release her

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
the belly and that starts to release her
pelvis<00:00:46.230> forward<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:48.239> that's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pelvis forward so you can see how that's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
pelvis forward so you can see how that's
starting<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.960> release<00:00:49.350> her<00:00:49.590> pelvis<00:00:49.980> forward

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
starting to release her pelvis forward

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.689 
starting to release her pelvis forward
now<00:00:50.910> she<00:00:51.780> needs<00:00:51.929> to<00:00:52.140> also<00:00:52.320> release<00:00:52.920> her<00:00:53.219> ankles

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
now she needs to also release her ankles

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.669 
now she needs to also release her ankles
in<00:00:53.879> front<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.629> order<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.170> allow<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
in front in order to allow that to

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.209 
in front in order to allow that to
happen

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
happen

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.150 
happen
she's<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.269> needing<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> let<00:00:58.140> her<00:00:58.379> bali<00:00:58.589> body

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
she's also needing to let her bali body

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.020 
she's also needing to let her bali body
fall<00:00:59.579> into<00:01:00.030> my<00:01:00.179> hand<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> at<00:01:02.789> home

up against a wall you can put your arms

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700 
up against a wall you can put your arms
out<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.660> against<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> wall<00:01:16.260> but<00:01:16.470> still

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
out and be against the wall but still

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
out and be against the wall but still
feel<00:01:17.010> that<00:01:17.520> lower<00:01:17.820> half<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.330> body<00:01:18.480> just

feel that lower half of your body just
falling<00:01:19.410> forward<00:01:20.240> okay<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.870> is<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
falling forward okay so this is the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.080 
falling forward okay so this is the
first<00:01:22.380> step<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.370> we're<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:23.880> K

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
first step now we're going to take K

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.790 
first step now we're going to take K
just<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.660> forward<00:01:24.870> rip<00:01:25.230> right<00:01:25.500> here

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
just a little forward rip right here

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.750 
just a little forward rip right here
this<00:01:25.980> should<00:01:26.190> take<00:01:26.340> her<00:01:26.520> pretty<00:01:27.180> much<00:01:27.360> into

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
this should take her pretty much into

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.800 
this should take her pretty much into
she's<00:01:29.760> going<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.120> too<00:01:30.270> far<00:01:30.540> forward

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
she's going a little too far forward

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.740 
she's going a little too far forward

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
literally taking it forward in space

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.320 
literally taking it forward in space
once<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> pelvis<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.580> over<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.910> balls<00:01:54.120> of

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
settle and now what we're going to do is

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.830 
settle and now what we're going to do is
allow<00:01:59.730> the<00:01:59.760> upper<00:02:00.600> body<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:02.730> balance<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
allow the upper body to balance the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.469 
allow the upper body to balance the
chest<00:02:04.170> comes<00:02:04.470> up<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.310> chin<00:02:05.550> comes<00:02:05.580> down

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.130 

and<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.810> brings<00:02:11.530> Kay<00:02:12.129> into<00:02:15.090> full<00:02:16.140> body

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and this brings Kay into full body

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.619 
and this brings Kay into full body
balance<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.950> once<00:02:18.670> she's<00:02:18.879> in<00:02:18.909> this<00:02:19.299> kind<00:02:19.540> of

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
balance and once she's in this kind of

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.830 
balance and once she's in this kind of
balance<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.079> can<00:02:20.349> see<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.769> her<00:02:21.040> arms<00:02:21.909> are

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
balance you can see that her arms are

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.990 
balance you can see that her arms are
starting<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.590> want<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.220> be<00:02:24.370> on<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.610> back<00:02:24.819> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
starting to want to be on the back of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.180 
starting to want to be on the back of
her<00:02:25.150> shoulders<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.599> little<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:26.079> more<00:02:26.290> that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
her shoulders a little bit more that

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.369 
her shoulders a little bit more that
means<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:27.909> they<00:02:28.299> don't<00:02:28.329> have<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.200> much

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
means that they don't have to do so much

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.160 
means that they don't have to do so much
work<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.950> try<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.310> keep<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.790> arms<00:02:31.239> coming<00:02:31.930> off

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
work to try and keep the arms coming off

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.619 
work to try and keep the arms coming off
the<00:02:32.349> sides<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.860> her<00:02:33.010> body<00:02:33.159> because<00:02:34.150> now<00:02:34.450> they

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
the sides of her body because now they

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.449 
the sides of her body because now they
can<00:02:34.690> hang<00:02:35.079> off<00:02:35.349> there's<00:02:35.709> something<00:02:36.159> called<00:02:36.370> a

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
can hang off there's something called a

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.610 
can hang off there's something called a
shoulder<00:02:36.819> girdle<00:02:37.180> here<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.989> they<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.290> hang<00:02:38.470> up

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
shoulder girdle here so they can hang up

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.690 
shoulder girdle here so they can hang up
quite<00:02:38.920> nicely<00:02:38.950> here

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
quite nicely here

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.780 
quite nicely here
and<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.930> with<00:02:41.500> Kay<00:02:41.739> in<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.069> position<00:02:42.519> she's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and so with Kay in this position she's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.300 
and so with Kay in this position she's
now<00:02:43.000> ready<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.359> start<00:02:43.720> walking<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.319> so<00:02:44.920> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
now ready to start walking and so here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.009 
now ready to start walking and so here
we're<00:02:45.549> gonna<00:02:45.640> show<00:02:45.909> her<00:02:46.150> starting<00:02:46.659> to<00:02:46.870> do<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
we're gonna show her starting to do a

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.530 
we're gonna show her starting to do a
stride<00:02:47.440> by<00:02:48.220> letting<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.909> pelvis<00:02:49.299> come

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
stride by letting the pelvis come

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.559 
stride by letting the pelvis come
forward<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.109> she's<00:02:50.290> gonna<00:02:50.440> let<00:02:50.680> herself<00:02:50.920> fall

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
forward and she's gonna let herself fall

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.990 
forward and she's gonna let herself fall
until<00:02:52.569> she<00:02:52.900> takes<00:02:53.799> her<00:02:53.980> next<00:02:54.250> step<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.730> there

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
until she takes her next step and there

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.379 
until she takes her next step and there
she<00:02:55.180> goes

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
she goes

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.509 
she goes
so<00:02:56.019> there<00:02:56.230> we're<00:02:56.349> exaggerating<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.159> movement

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
so there we're exaggerating the movement

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.399 
so there we're exaggerating the movement
right<00:02:57.760> here<00:02:57.790> at<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.480> moment<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.959> now<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.170> can

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
right here at the moment and now you can

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.119 
right here at the moment and now you can
see<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.489> she's<00:03:01.030> now<00:03:01.269> doing<00:03:01.659> the<00:03:01.780> fall<00:03:02.129> and

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
see that she's now doing the fall and

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.830 
see that she's now doing the fall and
we're<00:03:03.849> gonna<00:03:03.940> turn<00:03:04.209> her<00:03:04.480> around<00:03:04.569> and<00:03:06.840> she

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
we're gonna turn her around and she

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.660 
we're gonna turn her around and she
doesn't<00:03:08.019> actually<00:03:08.319> have<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.950> fall<00:03:09.159> now<00:03:09.400> but

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
doesn't actually have to fall now but

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.729 
doesn't actually have to fall now but
she<00:03:10.209> still<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.540> letting<00:03:11.049> her<00:03:11.200> lower<00:03:11.440> back

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
she still is letting her lower back

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.500 
she still is letting her lower back
release<00:03:12.129> look<00:03:12.519> at<00:03:12.639> that<00:03:12.790> beautiful<00:03:13.209> lower

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
release look at that beautiful lower

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.589 
release look at that beautiful lower
back<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.709> chest<00:03:15.040> opens<00:03:15.519> up<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:16.000> each<00:03:16.180> stride

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
back the chest opens up for each stride

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.289 
back the chest opens up for each stride
and<00:03:17.519> Kay's<00:03:18.519> able<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.180> do<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.139> walk<00:03:20.319> now<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:22.090> a

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
and Kay's able to do the walk now in a

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.729 
and Kay's able to do the walk now in a
much<00:03:22.449> more<00:03:22.859> gliding<00:03:24.599> balanced<00:03:25.599> easeful<00:03:26.199> way

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
much more gliding balanced easeful way

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.909 
much more gliding balanced easeful way
allowing<00:03:27.400> her<00:03:27.730> lower<00:03:27.910> back<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:29.590> be<00:03:29.709> very

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
allowing her lower back to be very

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.580 
allowing her lower back to be very
flexible<00:03:30.780> allowing<00:03:31.780> for<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> little<00:03:32.379> bit<00:03:32.500> of

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
flexible allowing for a little bit of

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.460 
flexible allowing for a little bit of
rotation<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.840> happen<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.049> she's<00:03:35.260> going<00:03:35.410> to

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
rotation to happen here she's going to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.199 
rotation to happen here she's going to
do<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.680> again<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.190> as<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.639> walk<00:03:36.849> you're<00:03:37.120> gonna

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
do it again so as you walk you're gonna

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.710 
do it again so as you walk you're gonna
find<00:03:37.569> that<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.040> left<00:03:39.489> hip<00:03:39.819> is<00:03:40.239> going<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.569> go

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
find that the left hip is going to go

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.869 
find that the left hip is going to go
forward<00:03:41.109> when<00:03:41.590> your<00:03:41.709> left<00:03:41.949> leg<00:03:42.129> goes<00:03:42.370> out<00:03:42.579> the

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
forward when your left leg goes out the

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.420 
forward when your left leg goes out the
right<00:03:43.120> then<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.780> left<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.560> right<00:03:44.859> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
right then the left then the right and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.189 
right then the left then the right and
the<00:03:45.519> left<00:03:45.699> then<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.329> right<00:03:46.449> then<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.169> left

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
the left then the right then the left

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.890 
the left then the right then the left
and<00:03:47.560> now<00:03:47.680> case<00:03:47.919> starting<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.459> get<00:03:48.609> a<00:03:49.060> little

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
and now case starting to get a little

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.599 
and now case starting to get a little
more<00:03:50.139> of<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.799> rotation<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.389> so<00:03:52.599> ka<00:03:53.220> again<00:03:54.220> now

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
more of a rotation and so ka again now

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.189 
more of a rotation and so ka again now
she's<00:03:54.909> starting<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.269> demonstrate<00:03:55.930> how<00:03:56.169> her

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
she's starting to demonstrate how her

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.220 
she's starting to demonstrate how her
pelvis<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:56.980> rotate<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.430> little<00:03:57.519> bit<00:03:57.760> more

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
pelvis can rotate a little bit more

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.259 
pelvis can rotate a little bit more
which<00:03:59.230> allows<00:03:59.560> her<00:03:59.829> ribs<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.489> rotate<00:04:00.909> in<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
which allows her ribs to rotate in the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.110 
which allows her ribs to rotate in the
opposite<00:04:01.659> direction<00:04:01.810> very<00:04:02.650> nice<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.280> then

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
opposite direction very nice and then

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.349 
opposite direction very nice and then
from<00:04:04.419> here<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:05.470> would<00:04:05.680> be<00:04:05.829> just<00:04:06.129> to<00:04:06.790> expand

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
from here it would be just to expand

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.689 
from here it would be just to expand
this<00:04:07.599> for<00:04:08.290> running<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.099> it's<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.430> same<00:04:09.639> thing

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
this for running so it's the same thing

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.849 
this for running so it's the same thing
for<00:04:10.000> running<00:04:10.510> she's<00:04:10.750> just<00:04:10.930> going<00:04:11.109> to<00:04:11.169> allow

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
for running she's just going to allow

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.280 
for running she's just going to allow
herself<00:04:12.129> to<00:04:12.669> fall<00:04:12.909> forward<00:04:13.419> a<00:04:13.690> little<00:04:14.169> bit

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
herself to fall forward a little bit

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.039 
herself to fall forward a little bit
more<00:04:14.590> for<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> run<00:04:15.639> so<00:04:16.419> even<00:04:16.659> though<00:04:16.780> she's<00:04:17.019> not

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
more for a run so even though she's not

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.020 
more for a run so even though she's not
able<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.500> show<00:04:17.739> much<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.190> run<00:04:18.370> here

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
able to show much of a run here

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.130 
able to show much of a run here
it's<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:19.450> same<00:04:19.750> idea<00:04:20.410> okay<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:22.120> this<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.570> how

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's the same idea okay so this is how

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.540 
it's the same idea okay so this is how
to<00:04:23.200> balance<00:04:23.470> through<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.070> center<00:04:24.310> of<00:04:24.340> your

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to balance through the center of your

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.790 
to balance through the center of your
structure
