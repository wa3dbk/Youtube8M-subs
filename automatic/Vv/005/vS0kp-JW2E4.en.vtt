00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.550 
would have used to get my crafting up
but<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> needed<00:00:14.610> level<00:00:15.089> 90<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:15.809> spider

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560

link which is a held for noxious weapons

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160 
link which is a held for noxious weapons
so<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.130> 1<00:00:20.250> level<00:00:20.490> 9<00:00:21.060> -<00:00:21.240> weapons<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.750> need<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> get

so for 1 level 9 - weapons I need to get
to<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.439> least<00:00:22.680> 85<00:00:23.369> crafting<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.180> then<00:00:24.300> boosted

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
to at least 85 crafting and then boosted

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.870 
to at least 85 crafting and then boosted
with<00:00:24.930> spices<00:00:25.350> -<00:00:25.800> but<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> turns<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
with spices - but it turns out that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.660 
with spices - but it turns out that
crafting<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.080> my<00:00:28.230> very<00:00:28.289> first

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
crafting is going to be my very first

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.179 
crafting is going to be my very first
non-combat<00:00:29.670> 99<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.960> right<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.650> 98

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
non-combat 99 because right now I'm 98

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.819 
non-combat 99 because right now I'm 98
and<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.239> I'll<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.660> getting

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
and I don't think that I'll be getting

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.440 
and I don't think that I'll be getting
dungeoneering<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.489> first<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
dungeoneering as my first one because I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.000 
dungeoneering as my first one because I
don't<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> point<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.410> doing<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.829> right

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
don't see the point of doing it right

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
don't see the point of doing it right
now<00:00:38.070> unless<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.300> experience<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.079> yeah

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
now unless it's for experience but yeah

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.650 
now unless it's for experience but yeah
crafting<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.280> my<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:41.700> first<00:00:41.790> 99

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
crafting is going to be my very first 99

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
crafting is going to be my very first 99
I<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> don't<00:00:44.040> want<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> 99

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I kind of don't want to get it 99

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.270 
I kind of don't want to get it 99
because<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> means<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.800> no<00:00:47.039> longer

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because that means that I can no longer

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.180 
because that means that I can no longer
afk<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.750> much<00:00:49.050> because<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.860> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
even know if that is true some of you

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.950 
even know if that is true some of you
said<00:01:09.780> keep<00:01:10.380> at<00:01:10.560> least<00:01:11.420> 750,000<00:01:12.420> gold<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> your

coffers I don't know what that does

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.410 
coffers I don't know what that does
because<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.810> takes<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.759> 75,000<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
because it takes out 75,000 so it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.880 
because it takes out 75,000 so it
shouldn't<00:01:18.720> matter<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:20.780> 750,000<00:01:21.780> or

shouldn't matter if it's 750,000 or

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.510 
shouldn't matter if it's 750,000 or
75,000<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.070> anyway<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:24.619> am<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.310> 2

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
magic seeds yeah so teak logs are for

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.289 
magic seeds yeah so teak logs are for
construction<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.860> maple<00:02:02.460> logs<00:02:02.579> are<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
construction and maple logs are for the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.569 
construction and maple logs are for the
fletching<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:04.350> possibly<00:02:05.100> find<00:02:05.340> making

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
fletching and then possibly find making

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 
fletching and then possibly find making
or<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.210> could<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.840> claim<00:02:07.380> coal<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.740> guess

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
or I could just claim coal I guess

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.040 
or I could just claim coal I guess
because<00:02:08.759> fire<00:02:09.030> making<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.450> quite<00:02:09.690> easy<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
because fire making is quite easy I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.500 
because fire making is quite easy I
could<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.860> what<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.819> curly<00:02:12.270> roots

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
could get it with what is it curly roots

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.640 
could get it with what is it curly roots
or<00:02:12.750> something

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
or something

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.559

range<00:03:24.419> I<00:03:24.799> don't<00:03:25.799> actually<00:03:26.010> feel<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.790> need<00:03:27.090> now

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
range I don't actually feel the need now

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.479 
range I don't actually feel the need now
to<00:03:27.449> go<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.230> collect<00:03:28.620> these<00:03:28.919> keys<00:03:29.280> because

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
to go and collect these keys because

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.849 
to go and collect these keys because
these<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:30.030> take<00:03:30.060> ages<00:03:30.659> so<00:03:31.349> what<00:03:31.500> happened

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
these can take ages so what happened

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.159 
these can take ages so what happened
before<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.310> is<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.519> collected<00:03:33.299> keys<00:03:33.569> for<00:03:33.840> full

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
before it is I collected keys for full

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.170 
before it is I collected keys for full
five<00:03:34.440> days<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.099> I<00:03:35.159> collected<00:03:35.639> quite<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:35.879> lot<00:03:36.150> of

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
five days and I collected quite a lot of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.289 
five days and I collected quite a lot of
those<00:03:36.449> I<00:03:36.599> got<00:03:36.780> like<00:03:37.199> 30<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.769> each<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.489> I

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
those I got like 30 of each and I

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
those I got like 30 of each and I
started<00:03:39.750> using<00:03:39.900> them<00:03:40.169> up<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.560> guess<00:03:41.340> what

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
started using them up and guess what

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.629 
started using them up and guess what
happened<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.120> got<00:03:42.599> 0<00:03:42.930> cygnets<00:03:43.470> out<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:44.010> so

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
happened I got 0 cygnets out of that so

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.469 
happened I got 0 cygnets out of that so
really<00:03:45.540> five<00:03:45.870> days<00:03:46.139> were<00:03:46.379> wasted<00:03:46.919> and<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:48.239> I'm

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
really five days were wasted and if I'm

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.050 
really five days were wasted and if I'm
doing<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.079> taxi<00:03:49.620> every<00:03:50.159> day<00:03:50.340> for<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.669> an<00:03:50.909> hour

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
doing a taxi every day for like an hour

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.490 
doing a taxi every day for like an hour
or<00:03:51.479> so<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:52.019> know<00:03:52.409> it's<00:03:52.979> not<00:03:53.159> as<00:03:53.340> much<00:03:53.549> time<00:03:53.849> and

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
or so you know it's not as much time and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.349 
or so you know it's not as much time and
getting<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.739> level<00:03:55.919> 90<00:03:56.220> weapon<00:03:56.639> from<00:03:56.849> an<00:03:57.000> axe<00:03:57.180> it

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
getting a level 90 weapon from an axe it

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.129 
getting a level 90 weapon from an axe it
would<00:03:57.479> be<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:58.199> way<00:03:58.560> faster<00:03:59.129> and<00:04:00.019> unless<00:04:01.019> I

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
would be just way faster and unless I

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.270 
would be just way faster and unless I
get<00:04:01.199> something<00:04:01.650> right<00:04:01.889> now

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
get something right now

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.710 
get something right now
because<00:04:02.489> right<00:04:02.699> now<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:02.909> three<00:04:03.060> cygnets

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
because right now I have three cygnets

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.229 
because right now I have three cygnets
so<00:04:04.349> if<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.680> get<00:04:04.859> my<00:04:05.010> fourth<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.519> right<00:04:05.760> now<00:04:05.970> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
so if I get my fourth one right now I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.009 
so if I get my fourth one right now I
guess<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.019> could<00:04:07.650> camp<00:04:08.129> then<00:04:08.459> but<00:04:09.449> I<00:04:09.479> only<00:04:09.780> have

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
guess I could camp then but I only have

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.569 
guess I could camp then but I only have
one<00:04:10.049> cue<00:04:10.470> left<00:04:10.709> so<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:10.979> don't<00:04:11.250> think<00:04:11.370> that's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
one cue left so I don't think that's

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.119 
one cue left so I don't think that's
going<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.879> happen<00:04:12.500> okay<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.829> is<00:04:13.949> going<00:04:14.069> to

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
going to happen okay so this is going to

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.949 
going to happen okay so this is going to
be<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.400> last<00:04:14.549> kill<00:04:14.879> I<00:04:15.090> have<00:04:15.239> no<00:04:15.479> more<00:04:15.720> keys

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
be the last kill I have no more keys

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.069 
be the last kill I have no more keys
after<00:04:16.289> this<00:04:16.530> unless<00:04:17.150> for<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.419> cygnets<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.049> I

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
after this unless for the cygnets that I

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.920 
after this unless for the cygnets that I
already<00:04:19.590> have<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.090> not<00:04:21.209> shining<00:04:21.690> and

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
already have so this is not shining and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.010 
already have so this is not shining and
obviously<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.919> not<00:04:22.950> signet<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.849> GG<00:04:24.719> I

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
obviously this is not signet so GG I

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.440 
obviously this is not signet so GG I
guess<00:04:25.860> no<00:04:26.340> Ascension<00:04:26.909> crossbow

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
guess no Ascension crossbow

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.390 
guess no Ascension crossbow
we'll<00:04:27.600> be<00:04:27.750> obtained<00:04:28.050> on<00:04:28.200> my<00:04:28.350> account<00:04:28.680> maybe<00:04:29.190> in

we'll be obtained on my account maybe in

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.310 
we'll be obtained on my account maybe in
the<00:04:29.490> future<00:04:29.610> if<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.030> feel<00:04:30.240> like<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.450> just<00:04:31.140> for

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
the future if I feel like it just for

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.290 
the future if I feel like it just for
achievement<00:04:31.920> or<00:04:32.040> something<00:04:32.460> after<00:04:33.180> I'm

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
achievement or something after I'm

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300

maxing<00:04:36.300> account<00:04:36.890> possibly<00:04:37.890> okay<00:04:38.640> so<00:04:38.700> it's

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
maxing account possibly okay so it's

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.640 
maxing account possibly okay so it's
twenty<00:04:39.240> five<00:04:39.390> thousand<00:04:39.840> health<00:04:40.020> now<00:04:40.230> I'll<00:04:40.440> try

my<00:05:24.810> money<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:25.980> kill<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.220> taxi<00:05:26.760> and<00:05:26.910> there

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
my money I just kill a taxi and there

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.660 
my money I just kill a taxi and there
you<00:05:27.360> go<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:28.470> is<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.710> second<00:05:29.100> kill<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.610> I

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
you go and this is the second kill and I

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.220 
you go and this is the second kill and I
think<00:05:29.910> this<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.180> going<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.480> be<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.750> last<00:05:30.960> one

today because I don't actually feel like

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.540 
today because I don't actually feel like
killing<00:05:33.270> more<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:34.380> forgot<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.800> activate<00:05:35.070> my

120,000<00:05:50.940> fletching<00:05:51.270> experience<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:52.290> is<00:05:52.470> just

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950
