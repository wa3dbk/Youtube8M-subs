00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
some of your movie clips will

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.280 
some of your movie clips will
automatically<00:00:02.939> play<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.540> some<00:00:03.870> will<00:00:04.259> be

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
automatically play and some will be

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.710 
automatically play and some will be
initially<00:00:04.920> in<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.100> stopped<00:00:05.339> state<00:00:05.720> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
initially in a stopped state the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.140 
initially in a stopped state the
automatic<00:00:07.319> play<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.740> what<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.370> default<00:00:08.849> for

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
automatic play is what is a default for

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.660 
automatic play is what is a default for
a<00:00:09.179> movie<00:00:09.480> clip<00:00:09.570> timeline<00:00:10.230> all<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.340> need<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> do

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
a movie clip timeline all you need to do

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.520 
a movie clip timeline all you need to do
is<00:00:11.820> add<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> simple<00:00:12.480> stop<00:00:12.690> action<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> first

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
is add a simple stop action to the first

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.140 
is add a simple stop action to the first
frame<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.280> will<00:00:14.460> keep<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.880> from

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
frame and that will keep you from

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.180 
frame and that will keep you from
playing<00:00:15.330> automatically<00:00:16.139> then<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.039> add

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
playing automatically then you can add

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.000 
playing automatically then you can add
buttons<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:18.390> control<00:00:18.560> further<00:00:19.560> or<00:00:19.740> stopping

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
buttons to control further or stopping

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.080 
buttons to control further or stopping
and<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.580> actions<00:00:22.519> here's<00:00:23.519> our<00:00:23.670> starting

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
and start actions here's our starting

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
and start actions here's our starting
and<00:00:24.240> completed<00:00:24.689> example<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> starting

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and completed example the starting

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
and completed example the starting
example<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.180> launched<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.689> all

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
example when it was launched was all

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.140 
example when it was launched was all
automatically<00:00:28.439> running<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.699> completed

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
automatically running and the completed

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.580 
automatically running and the completed
example<00:00:30.630> when<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:30.929> launched<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
example when it was launched as in a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.760 
example when it was launched as in a
stop<00:00:31.859> position<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.690> we<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> buttons

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
stop position and we can use the buttons

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520 
stop position and we can use the buttons
on<00:00:34.980> both<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> these<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:36.120> work<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.840> sames<00:00:37.140> just

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
on both of these to work the sames just

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.430 
on both of these to work the sames just
how<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:37.890> start<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> let's<00:00:39.750> see<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.140> make

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
how they start so let's see how we make

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
how they start so let's see how we make
this<00:00:42.230> open<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> start<00:00:43.710> file

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.209 

and<00:00:51.269> we'll<00:00:51.539> save<00:00:51.839> it<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> name<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> i'll

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and we'll save it with the name and i'll

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.770 
and we'll save it with the name and i'll
call<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.519> practice

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.630 

so<00:01:02.350> let's<00:01:02.559> examine<00:01:02.890> when<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.190> have<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.550> this

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
so let's examine when we have in this

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.910 
so let's examine when we have in this
file<00:01:03.940> let's<00:01:04.180> look<00:01:04.299> at<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.540> library<00:01:05.080> first<00:01:05.440> and

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
file let's look at the library first and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.330 
file let's look at the library first and
we<00:01:06.760> have<00:01:06.909> to<00:01:07.180> flash<00:01:07.780> button<00:01:08.110> symbols<00:01:08.619> one<00:01:09.159> is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
we have to flash button symbols one is

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.149 
we have to flash button symbols one is
the<00:01:09.549> play<00:01:09.909> button<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:11.890> stop

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
the play button and one is the stop

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.370 
the play button and one is the stop
button<00:01:12.400> these<00:01:12.909> were<00:01:13.119> gotten<00:01:13.479> from<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.840> common

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
button these were gotten from the common

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.580 
button these were gotten from the common
libraries<00:01:14.590> that<00:01:15.190> flash<00:01:15.520> has<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:17.320> have<00:01:17.560> a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
libraries that flash has and we have a

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.649 
libraries that flash has and we have a
movie<00:01:18.070> clip<00:01:18.190> called<00:01:18.490> red<00:01:18.790> circle<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.540> one

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
movie clip called red circle and one

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.899 
movie clip called red circle and one
called<00:01:19.930> Red<00:01:20.140> Square<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:20.860> inside<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.430> these<00:01:21.550> is

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
called Red Square and inside of these is

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.249 
called Red Square and inside of these is
simply<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.360> shape<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.690> take<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.869> look<00:01:25.960> at<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
simply a shape if we take a look at the

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.950 
simply a shape if we take a look at the
stage<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:27.040> come<00:01:27.460> down<00:01:27.640> near<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:27.970> timeline

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
stage and come down near the timeline

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.950 
stage and come down near the timeline
area<00:01:29.259> we<00:01:29.500> see<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.860> have<00:01:30.100> two<00:01:31.090> motion<00:01:31.659> tweens

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
area we see we have two motion tweens

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.969 
area we see we have two motion tweens
one<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.040> them<00:01:33.159> here<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.490> for<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.810> high<00:01:35.740> these

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
one of them here is for the high these

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.859 
one of them here is for the high these
layers<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.789> are<00:01:36.880> not<00:01:37.060> appropriate<00:01:37.270> right

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
layers that are not appropriate right

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.919 
layers that are not appropriate right
now<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.850> we<00:01:40.090> can<00:01:40.240> see<00:01:40.420> we<00:01:40.539> have<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.690> motion

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
now and we can see we have a motion

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.710 
now and we can see we have a motion
tween<00:01:41.229> for<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.950> Red<00:01:42.100> Square<00:01:42.509> movie<00:01:43.509> clip

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
tween for the Red Square movie clip

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.300 
tween for the Red Square movie clip
object<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.240> we<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.259> motion<00:01:47.470> tween<00:01:47.770> for

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
object and we have a motion tween for

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.919 
object and we have a motion tween for
the<00:01:48.840> red<00:01:49.840> oval<00:01:50.350> object<00:01:50.860> and<00:01:51.640> then<00:01:52.569> we<00:01:52.720> also

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
the red oval object and then we also

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.200 
the red oval object and then we also
have<00:01:53.350> our<00:01:53.619> buttons<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.520> are<00:01:54.550> on<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.940> stage

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
have our buttons that are on the stage

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.919 
have our buttons that are on the stage
and<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:58.240> let's<00:01:58.450> take<00:01:58.569> a<00:01:58.600> look<00:01:58.750> at<00:01:58.840> those

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
and so let's take a look at those

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.389 
and so let's take a look at those
buttons<00:01:59.319> and<00:01:59.710> we'll<00:01:59.860> come<00:01:59.950> up<00:02:00.039> here<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
buttons and we'll come up here to the

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.040 
buttons and we'll come up here to the
properties<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.210> can<00:02:01.270> see<00:02:01.509> they<00:02:01.810> have

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
properties you can see they have

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.840 
properties you can see they have
instance<00:02:02.710> names<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.250> we<00:02:03.280> can<00:02:03.460> use<00:02:03.610> them<00:02:03.759> in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
instance names so we can use them in

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.959 
instance names so we can use them in
ActionScript<00:02:04.569> that's<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.929> play<00:02:05.110> button<00:02:05.380> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
ActionScript that's the play button and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.380 
ActionScript that's the play button and
the<00:02:06.969> stop<00:02:07.240> button<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:09.549> since<00:02:09.820> this<00:02:09.970> name<00:02:10.209> is

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the stop button and since this name is

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.770 
the stop button and since this name is
stop<00:02:10.630> underscore<00:02:11.260> button<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.820> when<00:02:13.480> we<00:02:13.600> play

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
stop underscore button and when we play

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.210 
stop underscore button and when we play
this<00:02:13.959> movie<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> very<00:02:14.620> first<00:02:14.890> thing<00:02:15.100> that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
this movie the very first thing that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.240 
this movie the very first thing that
happens<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.269> starts<00:02:16.660> playing<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.410> we

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
happens is that it starts playing and we

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.620 
happens is that it starts playing and we
can<00:02:18.370> use<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.549> stop<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.150> play<00:02:19.299> button<00:02:19.600> to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
can use to stop and play button to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.020 
can use to stop and play button to
control<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:23.100> okay<00:02:24.100> let's<00:02:24.280> take<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> look<00:02:24.730> at<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
control it okay let's take a look at the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.850 
control it okay let's take a look at the
first<00:02:25.450> layer<00:02:25.690> which<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:25.930> our<00:02:26.200> ActionScript

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
first layer which is our ActionScript

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.430 
first layer which is our ActionScript
layer<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.760> its<00:02:28.360> name<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.600> abbreviated<00:02:28.959> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
layer and its name is abbreviated to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.259 
layer and its name is abbreviated to
a.a.s<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.829> we'll<00:02:30.579> just<00:02:30.790> right<00:02:31.060> mouse<00:02:31.239> click

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
a.a.s and we'll just right mouse click

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.110 
a.a.s and we'll just right mouse click
over<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.230> choose<00:02:32.820> actions<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
over this and choose actions it's the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.620 
over this and choose actions it's the
first<00:02:34.359> keyframe<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.859> actions<00:02:36.250> layer<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
first keyframe on the actions layer and

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.530 
first keyframe on the actions layer and
I'll<00:02:37.989> close<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.680> left<00:02:39.040> hand<00:02:39.280> side<00:02:39.370> panel<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
I'll close the left hand side panel and

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.890 
I'll close the left hand side panel and
we<00:02:40.750> can<00:02:40.900> see<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.230> there<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.950> boilerplate

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
we can see that there is the boilerplate

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.009 
we can see that there is the boilerplate
template<00:02:43.920> example<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:45.720> handling<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.810> mouse

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
template example for handling a mouse

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.780 
template example for handling a mouse
click<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.680> button<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.579> first

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
click for button and that's the first

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.150 
click for button and that's the first
one<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.239> play<00:02:49.480> button<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
one is for the play button and the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.460 
one is for the play button and the
second<00:02:51.489> one's<00:02:51.609> for<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> stop<00:02:52.030> button<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
second one's for the stop button and the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.430 
second one's for the stop button and the
actions<00:02:53.829> are<00:02:53.950> very<00:02:54.100> simply<00:02:54.489> play<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.970> stop<00:02:55.440> so

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
actions are very simply play and stop so

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.720 
actions are very simply play and stop so
these<00:02:57.150> two<00:02:58.380> template<00:02:59.380> codes<00:02:59.769> are<00:03:00.190> loaded<00:03:00.609> at

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
these two template codes are loaded at

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.060 
these two template codes are loaded at
the<00:03:00.880> first<00:03:01.150> frame<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.959> then<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> buttons<00:03:02.859> can

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
the first frame and then the buttons can

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.340 
the first frame and then the buttons can
react<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.549> them<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:04.390> can<00:03:04.540> also<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.200> first

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
react to them we can also in the first

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.979 
react to them we can also in the first
frame<00:03:05.680> either<00:03:06.070> before<00:03:06.250> or<00:03:06.519> between<00:03:07.359> or<00:03:07.750> after

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
frame either before or between or after

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.410 
frame either before or between or after
I<00:03:08.290> would<00:03:08.590> prefer<00:03:08.739> before<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.879> simply<00:03:10.209> put<00:03:10.390> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
I would prefer before is simply put a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.570 
I would prefer before is simply put a
stop<00:03:10.690> action<00:03:10.989> in<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.340> will<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.550> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
stop action in and so that will be the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.200 
stop action in and so that will be the
first<00:03:12.909> line<00:03:13.269> that's

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
first line that's

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.510 
first line that's
processed<00:03:14.720> in<00:03:14.960> the<00:03:15.500> first<00:03:15.740> frame<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.340> was<00:03:16.400> to

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
processed in the first frame it was to

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.110 
processed in the first frame it was to
stop<00:03:16.820> all<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:18.320> action<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.220> going<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.940> this

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
stop all the action is going on on this

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.910 
stop all the action is going on on this
timeline<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.960> other<00:03:21.080> words<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.440> scene<00:03:21.680> one

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.310 
timeline in other words the scene one
timeline<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.760> then<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.690> play<00:03:23.840> button<00:03:24.110> and

stop button is set up to respond to
mouse<00:03:26.120> clicks<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.290> let's<00:03:27.440> test<00:03:27.740> that<00:03:27.830> with<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
mouse clicks so let's test that with the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.450 
mouse clicks so let's test that with the
control<00:03:28.910> test<00:03:29.150> movie<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.650> we<00:03:30.950> can<00:03:31.100> see<00:03:31.250> now

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
control test movie and we can see now

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.190 
control test movie and we can see now
the<00:03:31.520> animations<00:03:32.450> are<00:03:32.630> stopped<00:03:32.930> at<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
the animations are stopped at the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.680 
the animations are stopped at the
timeline<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.890> stopped<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:35.210> course<00:03:35.420> we<00:03:35.570> can

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
timeline is stopped and of course we can

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.500 
timeline is stopped and of course we can
use<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.050> buttons<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.940> continue<00:03:37.940> playing<00:03:38.120> them

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
use the buttons to continue playing them

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.840 
use the buttons to continue playing them
one<00:03:38.870> thing<00:03:39.050> you'll<00:03:39.170> notice<00:03:39.320> that<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:40.040> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
one thing you'll notice that the it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.660 
one thing you'll notice that the it
stops<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.450> only<00:03:41.600> plays<00:03:41.780> one<00:03:42.140> time<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.770> this<00:03:43.520> is

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
stops it only plays one time and this is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.280 
stops it only plays one time and this is
a<00:03:43.700> result<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.300> playback<00:03:44.660> head<00:03:44.690> going<00:03:45.110> back

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
a result of the playback head going back

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.790 
a result of the playback head going back
to<00:03:45.470> frame<00:03:45.740> one<00:03:45.980> where<00:03:46.280> there's<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.490> stop<00:03:46.760> action

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
to frame one where there's a stop action

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.260 
to frame one where there's a stop action
that<00:03:48.800> was<00:03:48.920> easy<00:03:49.160> all<00:03:49.370> we<00:03:49.400> did<00:03:49.670> was<00:03:49.730> at<00:03:49.940> a<00:03:49.970> stop

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
that was easy all we did was at a stop

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.730 
that was easy all we did was at a stop
action<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.900> first<00:03:51.110> frame<00:03:51.320> of<00:03:51.650> the

automatically and then thereafter we

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.760 
automatically and then thereafter we
just<00:03:55.940> used<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.300> stop<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:56.720> start<00:03:56.900> buttons<00:03:57.470> to
