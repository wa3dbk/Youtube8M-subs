00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
accessory should come in pairs for some

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.699

reason<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:12.540> decided<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.959> use<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.290> galaxy

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
reason they decided to use the galaxy

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.229

warrior<00:03:14.010> arms<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.459> legs<00:03:14.639> so<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:14.910> may<00:03:15.030> just

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
warrior arms and legs so they may just

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.880 
warrior arms and legs so they may just
be<00:03:15.329> masters<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.930> universe<00:03:15.959> arms<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.709> legs

overall<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.799> really<00:03:20.099> poor<00:03:20.459> quality

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
overall just really poor quality

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.230 
overall just really poor quality
like<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.100> was<00:03:22.190> designed<00:03:22.640> by<00:03:22.790> someone<00:03:23.000> who<00:03:23.210> is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
like it was designed by someone who is

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.360
