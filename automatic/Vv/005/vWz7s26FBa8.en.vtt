ninja<00:00:22.680> was<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> scientist<00:00:23.699> who<00:00:23.970> proposed<00:00:24.480> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
ninja was a scientist who proposed to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.810 
ninja was a scientist who proposed to
follow<00:00:24.960> an<00:00:25.230> experiment<00:00:26.039> he<00:00:26.369> said<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.730> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
follow an experiment he said that you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.990 
follow an experiment he said that you
could<00:00:27.000> take<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> cat<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.859> box<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.820> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
could take a cat put it in a box but to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.380 
could take a cat put it in a box but to
quantum<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> box<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.920> close<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.180> box

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
quantum in the box as well close the box

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
quantum in the box as well close the box
and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:34.110> when<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> ain't<00:00:34.649> broken<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.640> cat

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and then when you ain't broken the cat

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.869 
and then when you ain't broken the cat
is<00:00:36.239> both<00:00:36.270> dead<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.840> alive<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> same<00:00:38.370> time

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
is both dead and alive at the same time

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
is both dead and alive at the same time
it's<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> zombie<00:00:40.200> cat<00:00:40.649> cuz<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it's kind of like a zombie cat cuz you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
it's kind of like a zombie cat cuz you
don't<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.579> you'd<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.510> close<00:00:42.989> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
don't know you'd be back just close so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.110 
don't know you'd be back just close so
screw<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.649> niggas<00:00:44.040> principle<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> there<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
screw the niggas principle is there on a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.260 
screw the niggas principle is there on a
basic<00:00:46.070> fundamentalist<00:00:47.070> level<00:00:47.610> everything

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
basic fundamentalist level everything

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
basic fundamentalist level everything
could<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.780> either<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.489> for

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
could be either this or that like for

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000 
could be either this or that like for
instance<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.180> pen<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> pain<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.649> now

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
instance this pen can be a pain but now

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
instance this pen can be a pain but now
that<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> ain't<00:00:53.550> looking<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.660> don't

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that you ain't looking at it you don't

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.090 
that you ain't looking at it you don't
know<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> know<00:00:56.070> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
know you don't know what you know what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
know you don't know what you know what
that<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.760> could<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.030> anything<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that is that could be anything that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
that is that could be anything that
could<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> cat<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.039> AIDS<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
could be a cat that could be AIDS so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.490 
could be a cat that could be AIDS so
that's<00:00:59.910> an<00:01:00.030> interesting<00:01:00.449> scientific<00:01:00.809> fact

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that's an interesting scientific fact

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799 
that's an interesting scientific fact
but<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.100> does<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.250> mean<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.690> see

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
but what does that mean to you will see

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
but what does that mean to you will see
I<00:01:03.840> figure<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.589> you're<00:01:04.739> gonna<00:01:04.860> apply

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I figure that way you're gonna apply

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
I figure that way you're gonna apply
that<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> real<00:01:05.700> life<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.750> say<00:01:07.290> your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that to real life it's like say your

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890 
that to real life it's like say your
girl<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> pregnancy<00:01:08.520> test<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> result

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
girl has a pregnancy test and the result

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.750 
girl has a pregnancy test and the result
on<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.380> test<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.580> either

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
on the test is going to be either

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
on the test is going to be either
positive<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:13.110> negative<00:01:13.250> but<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> scientific

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
positive or negative but the scientific

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
positive or negative but the scientific
approach<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.930> long<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.560> don't

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
approach is that as long as you don't

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.789 
approach is that as long as you don't
look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.700> neither<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.780> shoulder<00:01:19.500> nigga

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
look at it is neither a shoulder nigga

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
look at it is neither a shoulder nigga
there's<00:01:20.009> some<00:01:20.159> smart<00:01:20.430> people<00:01:20.640> might<00:01:21.000> say<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there's some smart people might say that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
there's some smart people might say that
if<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.840> girl<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.080> pregnant<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> her

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
if your girl is pregnant you know her

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.770 
if your girl is pregnant you know her
better<00:01:23.490> gonna<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.939> off<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.659> gonna

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
better gonna get off and you're gonna

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
better gonna get off and you're gonna
notice<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> anyway<00:01:25.830> even<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> don't

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
notice that anyway even if you don't

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
notice that anyway even if you don't
look<00:01:27.060> at<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> stick<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> why<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
look at the stick and that is why I

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
look at the stick and that is why I
can't<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.310> halfway<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.390> look<00:01:30.509> at

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
can't do this halfway you don't look at

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.060 
can't do this halfway you don't look at
the<00:01:30.689> girl<00:01:30.960> neither<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.530> now<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> don't<00:01:31.829> know

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the girl neither so now I don't know

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.740 
the girl neither so now I don't know
