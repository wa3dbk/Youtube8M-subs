this<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> similar<00:01:52.260> to<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> pancake<00:01:53.010> batter

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
this is similar to a pancake batter

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.760 
this is similar to a pancake batter

milk<00:01:58.800> down<00:01:59.010> first<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.790> because<00:01:59.850> i<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.210> put

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
milk down first just because i can put

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
milk down first just because i can put
the<00:02:00.479> flour<00:02:00.690> down<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.290> sometimes<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> gets

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the flour down first sometimes it gets

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
the flour down first sometimes it gets
caught<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.940> blade<00:02:03.180> mechanism<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.140> then

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
caught in the blade mechanism and then

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.649 
caught in the blade mechanism and then
that's<00:02:04.800> just<00:02:05.130> annoying<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.880> pretty<00:02:06.240> messy

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
nonstick skillet works we're also going

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.240 
nonstick skillet works we're also going
to<00:02:49.200> be<00:02:49.290> brushing<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> with<00:02:49.710> a<00:02:49.800> little<00:02:50.010> bit<00:02:50.130> of

to be brushing it with a little bit of
butter<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.300> you'll<00:02:51.750> see<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.290> just<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
butter and you'll see you just have to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.890 
butter and you'll see you just have to
get<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.280> hang<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.030> promise<00:02:54.150> it'll<00:02:54.720> come

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
get the hang of it I promise it'll come

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.480 
get the hang of it I promise it'll come
easy<00:02:55.140> enough<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.620> Alejandro<00:02:56.070> bleep<00:02:56.220> roofs

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
easy enough and Alejandro bleep roofs

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.070 
easy enough and Alejandro bleep roofs
and<00:02:56.820> she's<00:02:56.940> never<00:02:57.270> been<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.720> high<00:02:57.930> or

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and she's never been this high or

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.690 
and she's never been this high or
they've<00:02:58.410> never<00:02:58.620> done<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.950> before<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.520> can

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
they've never done it before so if I can

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.570 
they've never done it before so if I can
do<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.000> oh<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:01.260> don't<00:03:01.440> know<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.830> can<00:03:02.340> do<00:03:02.550> it

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
do it oh I don't know you can do it

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.670 
do it oh I don't know you can do it
tastes<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.180> little<00:03:03.270> practice<00:03:03.840> how<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.440> know

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
tastes a little practice how you know

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
tastes a little practice how you know
it's<00:03:04.860> hot<00:03:05.040> enough<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.910> know<00:03:06.030> by

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
it's hot enough is that you know by

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
it's hot enough is that you know by
holding<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.930> hand<00:03:07.140> over<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.500> would<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.800> sort

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
holding your hand over it would be sort

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 
holding your hand over it would be sort
of<00:03:08.130> warm<00:03:08.430> then<00:03:09.120> we're<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.990> brush

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
of warm then we're just going to brush

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.290 
of warm then we're just going to brush
this<00:03:10.770> with<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> thin<00:03:11.370> coat<00:03:11.700> of<00:03:11.730> butter<00:03:12.090> we're

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
this with a thin coat of butter we're

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.210 
this with a thin coat of butter we're
not<00:03:12.390> really<00:03:12.570> looking<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.110> fry<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.500> pancakes

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
not really looking to fry the pancakes

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.880 
not really looking to fry the pancakes
necessarily<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.230> trick<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
necessarily so the trick to the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.280 
necessarily so the trick to the
technique<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.670> making<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:18.209> crepe<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:19.110> put

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
technique of making a crepe is to put

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.260 
technique of making a crepe is to put
just<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.590> small<00:03:19.890> amount<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.280> batter<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.180> then

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
just a small amount of batter and then

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.730 
just a small amount of batter and then
actually<00:03:21.420> swirl<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.990> pan<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.230> let's<00:03:22.560> give

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
actually swirl the pan so let's give

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.060 
actually swirl the pan so let's give
this<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.980> try<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.530> small<00:03:25.530> amount<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.830> patter

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
this a try so a small amount of patter

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.280 
this a try so a small amount of patter
and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.550> swirl<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.000> pan<00:03:27.030> as<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.480> go<00:03:27.660> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and then swirl the pan as you go so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.010 
and then swirl the pan as you go so
you're<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.470> making<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.100> nice<00:03:29.550> thin<00:03:30.180> layer<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
you're just making a nice thin layer the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.690 
you're just making a nice thin layer the
sign<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.470> seasoned<00:03:31.920> pro<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.340> when<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.550> can

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
sign of a seasoned pro is when you can

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.850 
sign of a seasoned pro is when you can
really<00:03:32.940> do<00:03:33.120> both<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.390> them<00:03:33.750> really<00:03:34.380> well<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
really do both of them really well the

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.990 
really do both of them really well the
same<00:03:35.070> time

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
same time

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.380 
same time
like<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.630> exactly<00:03:36.960> enough<00:03:37.920> yeah<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.060> then

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
like that exactly enough yeah and then

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.950 
like that exactly enough yeah and then
