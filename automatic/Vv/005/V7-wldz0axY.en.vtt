my camcorder is actually an eyetie from

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.260 
my camcorder is actually an eyetie from
the<00:00:14.620> ps2<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:17.280> yeah<00:00:18.280> I<00:00:18.310> pretty<00:00:18.640> much<00:00:18.700> fail<00:00:19.030> on

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
the ps2 so yeah I pretty much fail on

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.900 
the ps2 so yeah I pretty much fail on
technology<00:00:19.900> side<00:00:20.110> however<00:00:20.800> I<00:00:21.100> decided<00:00:21.760> to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
technology side however I decided to

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.060 
technology side however I decided to
make<00:00:22.060> this<00:00:22.180> video<00:00:22.390> because<00:00:22.780> I've<00:00:23.619> spent<00:00:23.950> the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
make this video because I've spent the

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.270 
make this video because I've spent the
past<00:00:24.250> two<00:00:24.880> hours<00:00:25.270> looking<00:00:26.080> for<00:00:26.619> an<00:00:26.860> Ethernet

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
past two hours looking for an Ethernet

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.390 
past two hours looking for an Ethernet
controller<00:00:27.670> on<00:00:28.030> the<00:00:28.630> internet<00:00:29.050> by<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:29.949> the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
controller on the internet by a the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.680 
controller on the internet by a the
mtech<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:32.349> taught<00:00:32.559> me<00:00:33.609> ages<00:00:34.390> just

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
mtech and it taught me ages just

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.779 
mtech and it taught me ages just
to<00:00:34.809> find<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.230> one

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
to find this one

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.669 
to find this one
Ethernet<00:00:36.789> driver<00:00:37.179> was<00:00:37.449> absolutely<00:00:38.140> horrible

00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
Ethernet driver was absolutely horrible

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.189 
Ethernet driver was absolutely horrible
AVM<00:00:39.429> tech<00:00:39.729> I'm<00:00:39.969> not<00:00:40.210> sure<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:40.449> think<00:00:40.539> it's<00:00:40.780> gonna

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
AVM tech I'm not sure I think it's gonna

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.290 
AVM tech I'm not sure I think it's gonna
piss<00:00:41.589> or<00:00:41.829> something<00:00:41.859> but<00:00:42.249> this<00:00:42.670> control<00:00:43.179> is

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
piss or something but this control is

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.540 
piss or something but this control is
made<00:00:43.479> by<00:00:43.629> Infinium<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:46.199> recently<00:00:47.550> slide

I'll<00:00:51.460> show<00:00:51.609> you<00:00:51.670> Matt<00:00:51.909> so<00:00:52.479> I<00:00:52.539> adapt<00:00:52.749> my<00:00:52.809> dad's

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
I'll show you Matt so I adapt my dad's

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.759 
I'll show you Matt so I adapt my dad's
computer<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.510> ethernet<00:00:56.109> driver<00:00:56.379> because

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
computer and the ethernet driver because

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.840 
computer and the ethernet driver because
it<00:00:56.889> rated<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.429> from<00:00:57.639> XP<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.269> Vista<00:00:59.429> the<00:01:00.429> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
it rated it from XP to Vista the the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.279 
it rated it from XP to Vista the the
ethernet<00:01:01.179> controller<00:01:01.359> didn't<00:01:01.839> upgrade<00:01:01.959> with

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
ethernet controller didn't upgrade with

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.389 
ethernet controller didn't upgrade with
it<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:02.620> have<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:02.859> get<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.039> different

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
it so I have to get a different

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.149 
it so I have to get a different
controller<00:01:03.819> and<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.960> spent<00:01:05.259> two<00:01:05.560> hours<00:01:05.770> trying

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
controller and it spent two hours trying

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.770 
controller and it spent two hours trying
to<00:01:06.460> find<00:01:06.610> this<00:01:06.759> one<00:01:07.110> Ethernet<00:01:08.110> driver<00:01:08.409> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
to find this one Ethernet driver and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.859 
to find this one Ethernet driver and
there<00:01:10.780> were<00:01:10.869> no<00:01:10.990> videos<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:12.390> no<00:01:13.390> help<00:01:13.659> or

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
there were no videos and no help or

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.060 
there were no videos and no help or
anything<00:01:14.049> on<00:01:14.259> me<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.439> so<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.619> so<00:01:14.740> decided

yeah<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> computer

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.559 

to<00:02:16.920> ensure<00:02:17.249> you<00:02:17.400> gets<00:02:17.609> in<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.879> correct

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
to ensure you gets in the correct

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.699 
to ensure you gets in the correct
Ethernet<00:02:19.170> control<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:21.499> want<00:02:22.499> to<00:02:22.560> take<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
Ethernet control like you want to take a

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:35.410 
Ethernet control like you want to take a
little<00:02:22.889> look<00:02:23.069> at<00:02:23.159> this<00:02:23.310> thing

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.180 

we<00:02:35.870> go

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.270 

I<00:02:38.280> think

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
I think

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.920 
I think
Oh

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.089

uh-oh
that<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.540> Ethernet<00:02:51.079> controller<00:02:51.439> for<00:02:51.680> this

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
that is the Ethernet controller for this

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:01.460 
that is the Ethernet controller for this
board<00:02:52.090> and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.560 

that<00:03:02.100> would<00:03:02.700> be<00:03:02.850> serial<00:03:03.330> number<00:03:03.600> father<00:03:03.870> bog

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
that would be serial number father bog

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:25.540 
that would be serial number father bog

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
available in 64 32-bit systems I

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.990 
available in 64 32-bit systems I
personally<00:05:58.590> tend<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:58.950> use<00:05:59.070> 32<00:05:59.550> bits<00:05:59.790> on<00:05:59.910> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
personally tend to use 32 bits on the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.140 
personally tend to use 32 bits on the
older<00:06:00.240> models<00:06:01.040> because<00:06:02.040> it<00:06:02.460> uses<00:06:02.610> less<00:06:02.940> memory
