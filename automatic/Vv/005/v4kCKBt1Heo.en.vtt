went into her hair because I really like
the<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.700> kind<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.970> underwater<00:02:28.570> swept<00:02:29.140> flow<00:02:29.560> of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the the kind of underwater swept flow of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.890 
the the kind of underwater swept flow of
her<00:02:29.860> hair<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.280> all<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.670> little<00:02:30.910> sculpting

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
different strands of hair I think that

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.370

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
with the as far as like how he kind of

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.870 
with the as far as like how he kind of
draws<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.710> shape<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.190> creates<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> big<00:02:45.730> eyes

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
draws the shape and creates the big eyes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.550 
draws the shape and creates the big eyes
and<00:02:46.120> like<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.360> little<00:02:46.570> nose<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.050> think<00:02:47.080> this

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and like the little nose I think this

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.050 
and like the little nose I think this
