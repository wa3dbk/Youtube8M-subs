00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
i think i'm going to call this video the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.870 
i think i'm going to call this video the
men<00:00:07.710> naza<00:00:08.040> OSD<00:00:08.790> project<00:00:09.389> park<00:00:09.900> 5<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.759> had<00:00:11.759> an

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
men naza OSD project park 5 I had an

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560 
men naza OSD project park 5 I had an
addendum<00:00:12.420> which<00:00:12.630> was<00:00:12.809> sort<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> part<00:00:13.830> four<00:00:14.570> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
addendum which was sort of part four so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
addendum which was sort of part four so
this<00:00:16.020> video<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:18.020> about<00:00:19.020> how<00:00:19.859> i<00:00:19.890> mounted

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
this video is really about how i mounted

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.689 
this video is really about how i mounted
all<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.740> electronics<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> Mendez

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
all of the electronics for the Mendez

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.589 
all of the electronics for the Mendez
OSD<00:00:24.330> project<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.369> what<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> did<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.090> use<00:00:27.150> some

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
OSD project and what I did is I use some

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
OSD project and what I did is I use some
of<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.810> cable<00:00:28.289> hide<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.130> down<00:00:29.400> at

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
of this cable hide that I got down at

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.290 
of this cable hide that I got down at
the<00:00:29.760> hardware<00:00:30.660> store<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.489> put<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the hardware store and put all of the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.260 
the hardware store and put all of the
electronics<00:00:33.780> inside<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:36.000> i'll<00:00:36.210> just

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
electronics inside that so i'll just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.369 
electronics inside that so i'll just
show<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.680> works<00:00:42.140> moving<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.230> little

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
show you how that works moving a little

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.270 
show you how that works moving a little
closer<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> cable<00:00:49.800> hide<00:00:49.950> just

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
closer here so the cable hide just

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.240 
closer here so the cable hide just
basically<00:00:50.730> covers<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> electronics<00:00:53.329> now<00:00:55.250> let

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
basically covers the electronics now let

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
basically covers the electronics now let
me<00:00:56.280> turn<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.820> around<00:00:57.000> cuz<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.719> it'll<00:00:57.899> be

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
me turn this around cuz i think it'll be

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.610 
me turn this around cuz i think it'll be
a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.260> easier<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:59.930> if<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:01.079> go<00:01:01.289> around

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
a little easier to see if i go around

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.649 
a little easier to see if i go around
this<00:01:01.800> direction<00:01:04.220> okay<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.489> maybe<00:01:05.729> not<00:01:05.880> because

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this direction okay or maybe not because

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.060 
this direction okay or maybe not because
now<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> gps<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.650> here<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
now the gps is in the way but here we go

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.300 
now the gps is in the way but here we go
anyway<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> Naza

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
anyway so what I have here is the Naza

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.020 
anyway so what I have here is the Naza
in<00:01:17.700> light<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> located<00:01:19.110> right<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:20.030> towards

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
in light is located right here towards

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.260 
in light is located right here towards
the<00:01:21.090> front<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.750> motor<00:01:22.340> inputs<00:01:23.340> painting

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the front with the motor inputs painting

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.640 
the front with the motor inputs painting
forward<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> way<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.590> supposed

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
forward which is the way it's supposed

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
forward which is the way it's supposed
to<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:27.450> behind<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to be and then behind that I have the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.760 
to be and then behind that I have the
minim<00:01:31.320> OSD<00:01:32.180> right<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:34.320> laid<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
minim OSD right here just laid in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
minim OSD right here just laid in
sideways<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.549> it'll<00:01:35.759> come<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:37.079> can<00:01:37.229> take

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
sideways and it'll come out you can take

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.580 
sideways and it'll come out you can take
it<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.630> need<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> program<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.470> or

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it out of there if need to program it or

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.200 
it out of there if need to program it or
do<00:01:40.710> something<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> it'll<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.939> slip<00:01:42.180> right

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
do something to it it'll just slip right

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.389 
do something to it it'll just slip right
out<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:44.100> wires<00:01:44.610> running<00:01:45.299> between<00:01:45.570> here

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
out there are wires running between here

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
out there are wires running between here
between<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.850> nasm<00:01:48.299> light<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.110> receiver

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
between the nasm light and the receiver

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.270 
between the nasm light and the receiver
which<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> mounted<00:01:50.130> down<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:51.799> okay<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:52.860> where

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
which is mounted down here okay so where

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.719 
which is mounted down here okay so where
is<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> lead<00:01:53.729> module<00:01:54.829> well<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> LED<00:01:56.159> module

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
is the lead module well the LED module

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.240 
is the lead module well the LED module
is<00:01:56.969> mounted<00:01:57.860> underneath<00:01:59.090> right<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
is mounted underneath right there and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.670 
is mounted underneath right there and
the<00:02:02.250> USB<00:02:02.579> port<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.240> facing<00:02:03.689> towards<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.500> back

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the USB port is facing towards the back

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.830 
the USB port is facing towards the back
right<00:02:05.009> here<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.850> easy<00:02:06.000> access<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
right here so it's for easy access and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the lead LED is underneath here so the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.369 
the lead LED is underneath here so the
light<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.000> shining<00:02:12.270> downward<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
light will be shining downward if the

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.910 
light will be shining downward if the
quad

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
quad

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.530 
quad
after<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> above<00:02:14.670> me<00:02:14.880> I'll<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.180> able<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.420> see

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
after is above me I'll be able to see

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.900 
after is above me I'll be able to see
that<00:02:15.750> light<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:19.080> battery<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.760> main

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
that light and the battery the main

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.699 
that light and the battery the main
flight<00:02:21.209> battery<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.780> mounted<00:02:22.230> right<00:02:22.440> here

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
flight battery is mounted right here

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
flight battery is mounted right here
sideways<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.640> weight<00:02:23.790> distribution<00:02:24.510> but

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
sideways is for weight distribution but

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.890 
sideways is for weight distribution but
that's<00:02:24.870> another<00:02:25.620> matter<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.239> that's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
that's another matter so that's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.030 
that's another matter so that's
basically<00:02:28.110> how<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.590> laid<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.069> out<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.830> all

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
basically how I laid it out so it's all

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.320 
basically how I laid it out so it's all
a<00:02:32.069> nice<00:02:32.340> neat<00:02:32.610> package<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
a nice neat package in there and the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.900 
a nice neat package in there and the
video<00:02:36.750> from<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.290> minim<00:02:37.709> OSD<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.640> runs

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
video from the minim OSD just runs

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.440 
video from the minim OSD just runs
forward<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.220> cable<00:02:41.610> comes<00:02:41.850> out<00:02:42.209> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
forward here and the cable comes out and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.740 
forward here and the cable comes out and
goes<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> camera<00:02:43.349> right<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.750> then

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
goes to the camera right here and then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.840 
goes to the camera right here and then
the<00:02:45.959> other<00:02:45.989> cable<00:02:46.830> goes<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.580> video

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the other cable goes to the video

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.600 
the other cable goes to the video
transmitter<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.709> see<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.130> cloverleaf

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
transmitter you can see the cloverleaf

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.490 
transmitter you can see the cloverleaf
antenna<00:02:51.530> blue<00:02:52.530> beam<00:02:53.000> from<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.360> crazy<00:02:54.720> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
antenna blue beam from I be crazy and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.600 
antenna blue beam from I be crazy and
it's<00:02:55.650> mounted<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:58.680> or<00:02:58.950> screwed<00:02:59.250> on<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it's mounted on this or screwed on the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's mounted on this or screwed on the
video<00:02:59.880> transmitter<00:03:00.420> which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.840> under<00:03:01.110> here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
video transmitter which is under here

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.900 
video transmitter which is under here
and<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.620> has<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.799> heat<00:03:02.100> sink<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.819> a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
and it has a heat sink now that's a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
and it has a heat sink now that's a
little<00:03:03.120> hard<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.739> know<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.920> may

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
little hard to see but you know you may

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.740 
little hard to see but you know you may
not<00:03:05.220> be<00:03:05.580> even<00:03:05.819> using<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> same<00:03:06.420> video

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
not be even using the same video

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.630 
not be even using the same video
transmitter<00:03:07.319> i'm<00:03:07.560> using<00:03:07.950> i<00:03:08.040> got<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.459> point

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
transmitter i'm using i got a one point

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.180 
transmitter i'm using i got a one point
three<00:03:08.819> gigahertz<00:03:09.360> unit<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.350> maybe<00:03:10.860> you'll<00:03:11.100> be

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
three gigahertz unit and maybe you'll be

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.610 
three gigahertz unit and maybe you'll be
using<00:03:11.370> 5.8<00:03:12.209> or<00:03:12.420> something<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.810> but

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
using 5.8 or something like that but

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.840 
using 5.8 or something like that but
anyway<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:14.069> just<00:03:14.100> mounted<00:03:14.580> under<00:03:14.819> there<00:03:15.000> so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
anyway it's just mounted under there so

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.220 
anyway it's just mounted under there so
everything<00:03:17.850> basically<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.570> contained<00:03:19.049> in

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
everything basically is contained in

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.009 
everything basically is contained in
this<00:03:19.350> trough<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:23.609> microphone<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.540> right

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
this trough and the microphone is right

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.270 
this trough and the microphone is right
here<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.840> lead<00:03:28.019> for<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> also<00:03:28.739> goes<00:03:29.220> into

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
here in the lead for that also goes into

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.560 
here in the lead for that also goes into
the<00:03:29.910> trough<00:03:30.560> onto<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> video<00:03:31.890> cable<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> i

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
the trough onto the video cable so i

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.000 
the trough onto the video cable so i
just<00:03:36.810> thought<00:03:36.959> i'd<00:03:37.109> show<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:37.950> you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
just thought i'd show you that so you

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160 
just thought i'd show you that so you
can<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:39.060> one<00:03:39.329> way<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.600> can<00:03:39.810> mount<00:03:40.019> it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
can see that's one way you can mount it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.509 
can see that's one way you can mount it
all<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:41.310> then<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.910> cover<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:43.220> pops<00:03:44.220> back

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
all and then this cover just pops back

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.630 
all and then this cover just pops back
on<00:03:44.790> here<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.160> then<00:03:47.160> i<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.280> put

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
on here like that and then i just put

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.460 
on here like that and then i just put
this<00:03:48.620> tight<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.840> Velcro<00:03:51.840> around<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
this tight this a Velcro around it to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
this tight this a Velcro around it to
hold<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:54.200> which<00:03:55.200> conveniently<00:03:55.920> stuck<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
hold it which conveniently stuck to the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.630 
hold it which conveniently stuck to the
battery<00:03:57.150> down<00:03:57.299> here<00:03:58.250> I'll<00:03:59.250> tell<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.519> this

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
battery down here I'll tell you this

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.250 
battery down here I'll tell you this
velcro<00:03:59.880> is<00:04:00.150> good<00:04:00.299> stuff<00:04:00.829> yeah<00:04:01.829> there<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:03.260> ok

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
velcro is good stuff yeah there it is ok

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.670 
velcro is good stuff yeah there it is ok
so<00:04:04.920> then<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.220> just<00:04:05.430> put<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.870> velcro<00:04:07.230> tie

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
so then I just put that velcro tie

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.870 
so then I just put that velcro tie
around<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.370> make<00:04:08.489> sure<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.850> doesn't

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
around that to make sure that doesn't

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.699 
around that to make sure that doesn't
come<00:04:09.299> off<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.200> whole<00:04:10.380> thing<00:04:10.620> is

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
come off and this whole thing is

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.920 
come off and this whole thing is
fastened<00:04:11.190> down<00:04:11.340> nice<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.030> mean<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.870> like

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
fastened down nice I mean this is like

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.520 
fastened down nice I mean this is like
two<00:04:13.290> bolts<00:04:14.000> nylon<00:04:15.000> bowls<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.480> are<00:04:15.810> screwed

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
two bolts nylon bowls that are screwed

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.400 
two bolts nylon bowls that are screwed
down<00:04:16.680> inside<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> hold<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:18.450> tray<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:19.019> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
down inside to hold the tray down and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.319 
down inside to hold the tray down and
then<00:04:19.530> there's<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.829> tie<00:04:20.549> wrap<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.000> actually

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
then there's a tie wrap that actually

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.610 
then there's a tie wrap that actually
goes<00:04:21.510> around<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.989> receiver<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:25.200> vu

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
goes around the receiver and the the vu

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.440 
goes around the receiver and the the vu
LED<00:04:25.979> module<00:04:26.550> here

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
LED module here

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.810 
LED module here
and<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.530> also<00:04:28.740> holds<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.280> trade<00:04:29.550> because<00:04:29.730> it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
and that also holds the trade because it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.240 
and that also holds the trade because it
just<00:04:29.910> kind<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.210> pinches<00:04:30.570> them<00:04:30.690> right<00:04:30.870> there<00:04:31.250> so

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
just kind of pinches them right there so

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.310 
just kind of pinches them right there so
that<00:04:32.280> tray<00:04:32.640> is<00:04:32.700> not<00:04:32.790> going<00:04:33.180> anywhere<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:36.320> I've

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
that tray is not going anywhere and I've

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.630 
that tray is not going anywhere and I've
got<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> little<00:04:37.800> double<00:04:38.220> sided<00:04:38.460> tape

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
got a little double sided tape

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.900 
got a little double sided tape
underneath<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.860> Naza<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.160> light<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.760> it's

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
underneath the Naza in light but it's

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.490 
underneath the Naza in light but it's
not<00:04:42.060> really<00:04:42.270> needed<00:04:42.720> because<00:04:42.810> when<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> strap

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
not really needed because when I strap

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.440 
not really needed because when I strap
this<00:04:43.770> down<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.310> that<00:04:44.520> it's<00:04:44.850> not<00:04:45.030> going

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
this down like that it's not going

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.350 
this down like that it's not going
anywhere<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:46.020> mean<00:04:46.920> it's<00:04:47.100> permanently<00:04:47.580> fixed

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
anywhere I mean it's permanently fixed

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.030 
anywhere I mean it's permanently fixed
on<00:04:48.510> there<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.860> once<00:04:50.130> I<00:04:50.280> power<00:04:50.700> everything<00:04:51.150> up

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
on there so once I power everything up

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.270 
on there so once I power everything up
we<00:04:53.040> can<00:04:53.250> see<00:04:53.520> we<00:04:53.760> got<00:04:54.500> some<00:04:55.500> information<00:04:55.800> on

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
we can see we got some information on

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.510 
we can see we got some information on
the<00:04:56.430> screen<00:04:56.520> here<00:04:57.860> might<00:04:58.860> be<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.070> little<00:04:59.220> hard

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
the screen here might be a little hard

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.180 
the screen here might be a little hard
to<00:04:59.670> see<00:04:59.910> let<00:05:00.870> me<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.170> put<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.440> lens<00:05:01.590> cap<00:05:01.770> back

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
to see let me just put the lens cap back

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.740 
to see let me just put the lens cap back
on<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.460> camera<00:05:04.670> so<00:05:05.670> there's<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.150> information

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
on the camera so there's the information

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.120 
on the camera so there's the information
it<00:05:06.960> hasn't<00:05:07.290> acquired<00:05:07.470> any<00:05:07.830> satellites<00:05:08.490> yet

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
it hasn't acquired any satellites yet

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.950 
it hasn't acquired any satellites yet
but<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:12.000> can<00:05:12.060> see<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.510> battery<00:05:12.900> voltage

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
but you can see the battery voltage

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.270 
but you can see the battery voltage
going<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.740> down<00:05:14.040> here<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.830> throttle

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
going on down here and the throttle

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.500 
going on down here and the throttle
right<00:05:17.400> now<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.730> zero<00:05:18.000> because<00:05:18.090> they<00:05:18.330> don't

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
right now is zero because they don't

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.560 
right now is zero because they don't
have<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.750> throttle<00:05:19.140> up<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.620> of<00:05:19.860> course

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
have the throttle up and of course

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.530 
have the throttle up and of course
here's<00:05:21.570> here<00:05:22.100> mold<00:05:23.100> right<00:05:23.460> here<00:05:23.760> some<00:05:24.030> GPS

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
here's here mold right here some GPS

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.190 
here's here mold right here some GPS
mode<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.140> can<00:05:25.290> see<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.650> LED<00:05:26.630> icon<00:05:27.630> LED

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
mode and you can see the LED icon LED

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.400 
mode and you can see the LED icon LED
status<00:05:28.470> icon<00:05:29.070> blinking<00:05:29.310> there<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:30.230> here<00:05:31.230> is

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
status icon blinking there and here is

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.550 
status icon blinking there and here is
the<00:05:31.650> artificial<00:05:32.220> horizon<00:05:32.400> in<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:34.080> middle<00:05:34.380> and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
the artificial horizon in the middle and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.740 
the artificial horizon in the middle and
then<00:05:35.190> when<00:05:35.400> we<00:05:35.430> got<00:05:35.700> enough<00:05:35.970> satellites<00:05:36.510> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
then when we got enough satellites the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.650 
then when we got enough satellites the
GPS<00:05:37.200> information<00:05:37.470> would<00:05:38.160> come<00:05:39.150> up<00:05:39.300> on<00:05:39.510> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
GPS information would come up on the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.630 
GPS information would come up on the
left<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.200> at<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.470> top<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.950> screen<00:05:41.040> so

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
left and at the top of the screen so

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.220 
left and at the top of the screen so
that's<00:05:42.090> pretty<00:05:42.420> much<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:44.840> got<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.870> little<00:05:46.050> piece

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
that's pretty much it got a little piece

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.830 
that's pretty much it got a little piece
of<00:05:46.440> aluminum<00:05:46.980> here<00:05:47.310> that<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> an<00:05:47.850> L<00:05:48.150> bracket<00:05:48.720> to

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
of aluminum here that I an L bracket to

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.410 
of aluminum here that I an L bracket to
hold<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:49.170> camera<00:05:49.470> and<00:05:49.860> then<00:05:50.130> there's<00:05:50.420> dust

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
hold the camera and then there's dust

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.730 
hold the camera and then there's dust
some<00:05:52.010> single-sided<00:05:54.260> weatherstrip<00:05:55.260> foam

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
some single-sided weatherstrip foam

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.650 
some single-sided weatherstrip foam
underneath<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:56.700> two<00:05:56.970> strips<00:05:57.300> of<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:59.540> and<00:06:00.540> I

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
underneath that two strips of that and I

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.830 
underneath that two strips of that and I
put<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.020> video<00:06:01.680> battery<00:06:02.130> up<00:06:02.310> here<00:06:02.670> because<00:06:03.480> of

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
put the video battery up here because of

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.110 
put the video battery up here because of
weight<00:06:04.560> distribution<00:06:05.310> again<00:06:05.580> I<00:06:05.610> don't<00:06:05.820> have<00:06:06.090> a

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
weight distribution again I don't have a

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.240 
weight distribution again I don't have a
go<00:06:06.360> pro<00:06:06.630> or<00:06:06.870> heavy<00:06:07.110> camera<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.680> put<00:06:07.830> up<00:06:07.950> here

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
go pro or heavy camera to put up here

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.730 
go pro or heavy camera to put up here
and<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:08.850> needed<00:06:09.060> to<00:06:09.240> balance<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.840> CG<00:06:10.260> so<00:06:10.530> I<00:06:10.590> just

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
and I needed to balance the CG so I just

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.460 
and I needed to balance the CG so I just
put<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.010> battery<00:06:11.370> there<00:06:11.580> for<00:06:11.760> now<00:06:12.170> that<00:06:13.170> is

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
put the battery there for now that is

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.650 
put the battery there for now that is
all<00:06:13.680> subject<00:06:14.220> to<00:06:14.280> change<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:15.000> may<00:06:15.330> be<00:06:15.390> moving

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
all subject to change I may be moving

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.350 
all subject to change I may be moving
the<00:06:15.870> batteries<00:06:16.290> around<00:06:16.410> later<00:06:16.860> if<00:06:17.130> I<00:06:17.250> get<00:06:17.430> you

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
the batteries around later if I get you

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.970 
the batteries around later if I get you
know<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.480> different<00:06:18.720> setup<00:06:19.110> with<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.500> cameras

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
know a different setup with the cameras

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.760 
know a different setup with the cameras
or<00:06:20.220> maybe<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.550> get<00:06:20.880> some<00:06:21.440> landing<00:06:22.440> skids

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
or maybe I get some landing skids

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.010 
or maybe I get some landing skids
underneath<00:06:23.280> here<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:24.600> I<00:06:24.660> can<00:06:24.810> put<00:06:24.930> the

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
underneath here and I can put the

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.020 
underneath here and I can put the
battery<00:06:25.380> on<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.650> bottom<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.550> flight<00:06:26.820> battery

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
battery on the bottom the flight battery

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.780 
battery on the bottom the flight battery
on<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.420> bottom<00:06:28.010> it's<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.660> work<00:06:30.660> in<00:06:30.840> progress<00:06:31.790> so

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
on the bottom it's a work in progress so

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.930 
on the bottom it's a work in progress so
there<00:06:33.060> it<00:06:33.180> is<00:06:33.240> for<00:06:33.630> now<00:06:34.610> just<00:06:35.610> thought<00:06:35.760> I'd<00:06:35.910> let

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
there it is for now just thought I'd let

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.400 
there it is for now just thought I'd let
you<00:06:36.090> know<00:06:36.330> how<00:06:36.570> it<00:06:36.600> all<00:06:36.780> finally<00:06:37.080> went

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
you know how it all finally went

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.560 
you know how it all finally went
together
