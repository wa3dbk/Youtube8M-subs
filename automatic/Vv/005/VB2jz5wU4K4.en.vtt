00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
 don't wanna tell you a bow he is from very 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 just stupid by the name of the case 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.439
 essentially Ukraine 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.439
 thing is 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:15.629
 Kuklachev 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.180
 launched and with Pushkin you need to get there 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.900
 asterisk 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.179
 it looks like 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.550
 here so today level 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.689
 the very first 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.819
 she will immediately note that 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.179
 divided equally by difficulty 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.179
 there is the simplest that is, under the conditions 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.130
 as difficult as possible 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.880
 I will choose the first level 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.060
 I'll start with him so that 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.310
 for whom this composition and descent 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.750
 and asterisk 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.120
 aiming 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.430
 selects the power of shots only on 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.370
 what is 90 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.370
 in the congress to shoot a doll 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.050
 sometimes have to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 various projects 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.740
 to doll 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.420
 hit where necessary 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.100
 the first attempt to do this you can not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.140
 is always 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.820
 have to train 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.410
 in the end 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.470
 every attempt is given points 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.740
 Points are awarded for 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.090
 the amount used to you 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 shots all the less the better 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.750
 during which 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.750
 it took the doll to fly 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.620
 now we finally disappear after a dandy 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.700
 for some time they have such here 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.680
 green stuff and those 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 moving figures that can be knocked down 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.530
 try to do 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 what besides 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130
 generally 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160
 when bills hitting stones 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.510
 getting drunk 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.450
 periodically 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.450
 husband often see here 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.890
 some complicated 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.470
 some 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.410
 simpler 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.769
 and here are these levels 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.089
 here for example 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.149
 have to shot immediately heaps of dolls 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:15.259
 I hope that what 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.539
 But with some kind of fast flies 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.739
 for example, screamed 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.869
 from the words thus the passage is harsh 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.439
 in my opinion a funny screen 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.359
 the topic of which 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.359
 can spend a lot of time 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.449
 I have 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.449
 the asterisk flew away 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.169
 that's how he got stuck 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.159
 passed 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.149
 the game can be downloaded in March 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.669
 hair about complex in their article is easy 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.019
 NATO
