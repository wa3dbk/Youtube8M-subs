00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
it just seemed like a way for us as a

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.610 
it just seemed like a way for us as a
family<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.480> give<00:02:04.720> back<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.140> dad

family to give back to dad
I<00:02:05.650> never<00:02:06.430> expected<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.840> would<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.470> hard<00:02:08.530> I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
I never expected it would be that hard I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.010 
I never expected it would be that hard I
was<00:02:09.580> thinking<00:02:09.940> more<00:02:10.119> about<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> trip<00:02:10.630> going

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
up and down I kept looking back and just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.640 
up and down I kept looking back and just
