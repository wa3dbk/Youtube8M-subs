Sharkey for pointing that out to me I

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
don't know if it really would've made

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.720 
don't know if it really would've made
much<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.500> difference<00:02:32.530> but<00:02:33.070> I'm<00:02:33.160> glad<00:02:33.280> I'm

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.370 
much of a difference but I'm glad I'm
glad<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.090> did<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.450> got<00:02:34.600> him<00:02:34.720> both<00:02:34.870> changed

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
glad you did and I got him both changed

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.160 
glad you did and I got him both changed
now<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.000> noticed<00:02:37.000> even<00:02:37.060> yesterday<00:02:37.390> after<00:02:37.989> just

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
now I noticed even yesterday after just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.930 
now I noticed even yesterday after just
changing<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> one<00:02:38.799> filter<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.280> my<00:02:39.310> truck<00:02:39.730> my

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
changing the one filter in my truck my

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.509 
changing the one filter in my truck my
a/c<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> lot<00:02:40.810> better<00:02:41.079> I<00:02:41.350> turn<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> air

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
a/c was a lot better I turn the air

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.160 
a/c was a lot better I turn the air
conditioning<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.269> nice<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.660> cold<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
conditioning on it was nice and cold and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.520 
conditioning on it was nice and cold and
lots<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.650> power<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.489> guess<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.600> does<00:02:46.810> you

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
lots of power so I guess it does you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.920 
lots of power so I guess it does you
know<00:02:47.760> once<00:02:48.760> those<00:02:48.910> things<00:02:49.150> plug<00:02:49.390> up<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.720> dirt

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
know once those things plug up with dirt

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.960 
know once those things plug up with dirt
it<00:02:50.079> does<00:02:50.260> obstruct<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.829> air<00:02:50.950> flow<00:02:51.280> obviously

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
it does obstruct the air flow obviously

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.539 
it does obstruct the air flow obviously
so<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:53.350> good<00:02:53.410> how<00:02:53.920> am<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.160> hope<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.400> guys

I<00:02:59.640> screwed<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.820> up<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:01.269> would<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.480> been

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
I screwed that up it would have been

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.420 
I screwed that up it would have been
nice<00:03:01.750> if<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.079> was<00:03:02.140> only<00:03:02.350> one<00:03:02.440> filter<00:03:02.829> per<00:03:03.130> truck

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
nice if it was only one filter per truck

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.849 
nice if it was only one filter per truck
