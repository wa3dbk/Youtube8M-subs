nice and I really like it I only gone
for<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.280> kit<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.690> hands<00:02:40.340> unlike<00:02:41.340> the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
for this kit it's the hands unlike the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.729 
for this kit it's the hands unlike the
the<00:02:43.920> command<00:02:44.190> Gundam<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:46.080> command<00:02:46.470> Ghanim

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
the command Gundam the command Ghanim

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.970 
the command Gundam the command Ghanim
has<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> peg<00:02:47.610> system<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.980> wrist

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
has a peg system on the on the wrist

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.910 
has a peg system on the on the wrist
that<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> solid<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.739> can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
that is a solid and you know you can

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.370 
that is a solid and you know you can
just<00:02:52.950> pop<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> hand<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.180> but<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:54.989> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
just pop the hand on it but this one it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.430 
just pop the hand on it but this one it
kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.620> its<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:56.100> revoltech<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.080> wrist

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
kind of its like revoltech so the wrist

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.330 
kind of its like revoltech so the wrist
movement<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.730> pegs<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.330> bit<00:03:00.510> event<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.560> that's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
movement it pegs a bit event and that's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.650 
movement it pegs a bit event and that's
you<00:03:02.790> know<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:04.080> makes<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.560> lot<00:03:05.220> harder<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:06.180> put

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you know it makes it a lot harder to put

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.089 
you know it makes it a lot harder to put
the<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.970> hand<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.989> as<00:03:10.290> well<00:03:10.500> as<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.830> having

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
the the hand in and as well as to having

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.400 
the the hand in and as well as to having
a<00:03:11.160> smaller<00:03:11.489> ball<00:03:11.790> joint<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:12.870> my<00:03:13.230> only

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
a smaller ball joint so that's my only

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.740 
a smaller ball joint so that's my only
call<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.099> but<00:03:14.549> once<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.299> get<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.599> in

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
call on this one but once you get it in

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.960 
call on this one but once you get it in
and<00:03:16.140> for<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.590> most<00:03:16.830> part<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.790> just

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and for the most part you will be just

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
for me I will still pick the command

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.229 
for me I will still pick the command
ganda<00:03:55.950> because<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.549> one<00:03:56.700> has<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.850> lot<00:03:57.060> more

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
ganda because that one has a lot more

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.420 
ganda because that one has a lot more
code<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:58.350> know<00:03:58.440> gimmicks<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:59.160> lot<00:03:59.310> of

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
code you know gimmicks a lot of

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.509 
code you know gimmicks a lot of
accessories<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.329> you<00:04:00.359> can<00:04:00.600> do<00:04:01.190> with<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
accessories that you can do with it and

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.280 
accessories that you can do with it and
it<00:04:03.060> doesn't<00:04:03.359> have<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.540> metallic<00:04:03.930> chrome

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
it doesn't have this metallic chrome

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.370 
it doesn't have this metallic chrome
finish<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.980> know<00:04:05.100> might<00:04:05.280> scratch<00:04:05.670> off

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
finish that you know might scratch off

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.879 
finish that you know might scratch off
but<00:04:07.380> still<00:04:07.730> there<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.760> pain<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.359> I<00:04:09.889> think

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
but still there is pain but I think

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.379 
but still there is pain but I think
there's<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.220> more<00:04:11.430> playability<00:04:11.880> without

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
there's just more playability without

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.660 
there's just more playability without
the<00:04:12.480> command<00:04:12.750> Gundam<00:04:13.139> but<00:04:14.130> yeah<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.370> mean<00:04:14.489> it's

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
the command Gundam but yeah I mean it's

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.960 
the command Gundam but yeah I mean it's
still<00:04:14.819> up<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.480> your<00:04:15.690> preference<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.970> I'm

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
still up to your preference and I'm

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.900 
still up to your preference and I'm
still<00:04:18.239> hoping<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.750> could<00:04:18.810> get<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.530> other<00:04:20.400> one<00:04:20.880> I

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
still hoping I could get the other one I

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.670 
still hoping I could get the other one I
like<00:04:21.060> another<00:04:21.750> super<00:04:22.080> deform<00:04:22.470> our<00:04:23.010> sdx<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
like another super deform our sdx is the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.159 
like another super deform our sdx is the
command<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:26.490> mass<00:04:26.700> commander<00:04:27.360> that's

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
command the mass commander that's

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.320 
command the mass commander that's
another<00:04:28.470> one<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:30.030> there<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.240> go
