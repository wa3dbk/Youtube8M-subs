using<00:00:22.040> a<00:00:22.250> bunch<00:00:22.580> of<00:00:22.759> different<00:00:23.480> effectors

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
using a bunch of different effectors

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.260 
using a bunch of different effectors
like<00:00:24.109> tracer<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:24.980> time<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:25.789> animating<00:00:26.210> them

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
like tracer and time and animating them

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.939 
like tracer and time and animating them
on<00:00:26.480> and<00:00:26.660> off<00:00:26.750> to<00:00:27.019> kind<00:00:27.199> of<00:00:27.260> snap<00:00:27.529> around<00:00:27.800> this

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
on and off to kind of snap around this

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.890 
on and off to kind of snap around this
type<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.400> from<00:00:29.029> there<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:29.330> want<00:00:29.510> to<00:00:29.630> bring<00:00:29.810> it

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
type and from there we want to bring it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.300 
type and from there we want to bring it
in<00:00:29.960> after<00:00:30.170> effects<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:30.769> create<00:00:30.980> this<00:00:31.070> kind<00:00:31.220> of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
in after effects and create this kind of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.610 
in after effects and create this kind of
glassy<00:00:31.849> look<00:00:32.059> as<00:00:32.300> well<00:00:32.510> as<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:32.930> colors

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
glassy look as well as the colors

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.290 
glassy look as well as the colors
changing<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:34.370> some<00:00:34.550> cool<00:00:34.790> post<00:00:35.120> production

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
changing and some cool post production

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.240 
changing and some cool post production
stuff<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.989> really<00:00:36.260> wrap<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:36.680> thing<00:00:36.739> up<00:00:37.070> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
stuff to really wrap this thing up and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.189 
stuff to really wrap this thing up and
make<00:00:37.400> sure<00:00:37.580> we're<00:00:37.850> put<00:00:38.420> an<00:00:38.510> extra<00:00:38.840> layer<00:00:39.140> of

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
make sure we're put an extra layer of

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.799 
make sure we're put an extra layer of
gloss<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.040> sheeting<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:40.909> top<00:00:41.150> of<00:00:41.330> all<00:00:41.510> of<00:00:41.570> our

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
gloss and sheeting on top of all of our

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.619 
gloss and sheeting on top of all of our
3d<00:00:42.589> animation<00:00:43.010> projects<00:00:43.519> so<00:00:44.059> what<00:00:44.360> I'll<00:00:44.449> do<00:00:44.600> is

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
3d animation projects so what I'll do is

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.630 
3d animation projects so what I'll do is
just<00:00:44.839> make<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:45.049> new<00:00:45.440> project<00:00:46.220> from<00:00:47.150> scratch<00:00:48.640> and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
just make a new project from scratch and

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.160 
just make a new project from scratch and
then<00:00:49.760> I'm<00:00:49.820> going<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.030> want<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.180> import<00:00:50.540> my<00:00:50.629> PNG

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
then I'm going to want to import my PNG

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.840 
then I'm going to want to import my PNG
at<00:00:51.320> sequence<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:51.860> I<00:00:51.920> have<00:00:52.100> right<00:00:52.309> here<00:00:52.369> so<00:00:52.760> in

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
at sequence that I have right here so in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.280 
at sequence that I have right here so in
the<00:00:52.909> last<00:00:53.059> video<00:00:53.269> we<00:00:53.600> wrapped<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:53.960> up<00:00:54.049> with

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
the last video we wrapped it up with

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.979 
the last video we wrapped it up with
rendering<00:00:54.619> out<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.460> PNG<00:00:55.940> sequence<00:00:56.449> with<00:00:56.839> an

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
rendering out this PNG sequence with an

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.960 
rendering out this PNG sequence with an
alpha<00:00:57.140> channel<00:00:57.650> of<00:00:57.830> our<00:00:58.190> whole<00:00:58.339> animation<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
alpha channel of our whole animation so

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.700 
alpha channel of our whole animation so
I<00:00:59.000> can<00:00:59.150> just<00:00:59.180> grab<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.629> first<00:00:59.930> frame<00:01:00.379> make

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
I can just grab that first frame make

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.759 
I can just grab that first frame make
sure<00:01:00.860> PNG<00:01:01.369> sequence<00:01:01.820> is<00:01:02.000> checked<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.080> then

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
sure PNG sequence is checked and then

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.679 
sure PNG sequence is checked and then
I'll<00:01:03.860> go<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.010> open<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.580> let's<00:01:05.330> set<00:01:05.479> up<00:01:05.510> our

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
I'll go to open and let's set up our

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.830 
I'll go to open and let's set up our
colors<00:01:06.080> real<00:01:06.380> quick<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.799> be<00:01:07.060> high<00:01:08.060> definition

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
colors real quick to be high definition

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.560 
colors real quick to be high definition
and<00:01:09.189> srgb<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.400> everything<00:01:10.700> matches<00:01:10.850> up<00:01:11.090> by

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and srgb so everything matches up by

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.000 
and srgb so everything matches up by
this<00:01:11.930> little<00:01:12.170> button<00:01:12.320> down<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:12.500> always<00:01:12.980> a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
this little button down here always a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.620 
this little button down here always a
good<00:01:13.190> point<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.580> start<00:01:13.610> projects<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.480> after

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
good point to start projects and after

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.900 
good point to start projects and after
effects<00:01:14.900> with<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.380> then<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.220> bring<00:01:16.490> this<00:01:16.610> and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
effects with and then to bring this and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.660 
effects with and then to bring this and
I'm<00:01:17.030> going<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.270> drag<00:01:17.570> this<00:01:17.950> PNG<00:01:18.950> sequence<00:01:19.310> onto

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
I'm going to drag this PNG sequence onto

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.250 
I'm going to drag this PNG sequence onto
the<00:01:19.790> new<00:01:19.910> composition<00:01:20.570> layer<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.110> that's

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
the new composition layer and that's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.540 
the new composition layer and that's
going<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.440> make<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> new<00:01:21.740> composition<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.490> we

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
going to make a new composition and we

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.250 
going to make a new composition and we
can<00:01:22.670> see<00:01:22.820> if<00:01:22.970> we<00:01:23.000> check<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.140> off<00:01:24.230> it

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
can see if we check this on and off it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.380 
can see if we check this on and off it
is<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:24.740> an<00:01:24.860> alpha<00:01:25.160> channel<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.000> we<00:01:26.180> want<00:01:26.330> to

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
is with an alpha channel so we want to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.330 
is with an alpha channel so we want to
set<00:01:26.540> up<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.720> background<00:01:27.170> color<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:28.100> some

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
set up the background color and do some

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.890 
set up the background color and do some
post<00:01:28.520> production<00:01:28.760> stuff<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:29.480> those<00:01:29.630> colors

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
post production stuff like those colors

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900 
post production stuff like those colors
changing<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.500> all<00:01:30.560> those<00:01:30.680> effects<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.400> first

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
changing and all those effects so first

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.910 
changing and all those effects so first
of<00:01:32.030> all<00:01:32.150> let's<00:01:32.390> make<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> background<00:01:33.260> solid<00:01:33.800> by

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
of all let's make a background solid by

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.730 
of all let's make a background solid by
going<00:01:34.160> layer<00:01:34.340> new<00:01:34.610> solid<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.630> I'll<00:01:35.750> go<00:01:35.930> white

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
going layer new solid and I'll go white

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.520 
going layer new solid and I'll go white
and<00:01:37.100> I'll<00:01:37.370> make<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.760> called<00:01:38.360> BG<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.350> that'll

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
and I'll make this called BG and that'll

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.860 
and I'll make this called BG and that'll
just<00:01:39.620> be<00:01:39.770> my<00:01:39.890> base<00:01:40.250> color<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.880> what<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.690> want<00:01:41.780> to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
just be my base color and what I want to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.200 
just be my base color and what I want to
do<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.200> have<00:01:42.409> some<00:01:42.620> adjustment<00:01:43.130> layers<00:01:43.310> with

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
do is have some adjustment layers with

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.910 
do is have some adjustment layers with
different<00:01:44.750> effects<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.290> kind<00:01:45.470> of<00:01:45.560> break

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
different effects to kind of break

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.950 
different effects to kind of break
things<00:01:46.220> up<00:01:46.370> for<00:01:46.580> color<00:01:46.820> correction<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.510> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
things up for color correction and that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.780 
things up for color correction and that
effect<00:01:48.470> so<00:01:48.680> I'm<00:01:48.830> going<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.010> go<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.190> layer<00:01:49.490> new

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
effect so I'm going to go to layer new

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.680 
effect so I'm going to go to layer new
adjustment<00:01:51.340> layer<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.760> i'll<00:01:53.180> call<00:01:53.360> this

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
adjustment layer and i'll call this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.910 
adjustment layer and i'll call this
glass<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:56.330> this<00:01:56.570> one<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.500> create<00:01:57.830> that

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
glass and on this one to create that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.830 
glass and on this one to create that
kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.159> glassy<00:01:58.670> effect<00:01:59.000> i'm<00:01:59.150> going<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.420> in<00:01:59.630> my

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
kind of glassy effect i'm going to in my

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.460 
kind of glassy effect i'm going to in my
effects<00:02:00.229> find<00:02:00.560> Cici<00:02:01.190> glass<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.900> I<00:02:02.990> drag

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
effects find Cici glass and if I drag

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.680 
effects find Cici glass and if I drag
this<00:02:03.500> on<00:02:03.920> here<00:02:04.400> it's<00:02:05.150> going<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.330> look<00:02:05.510> kind<00:02:05.570> of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
this on here it's going to look kind of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.649 
this on here it's going to look kind of
weird<00:02:05.750> at<00:02:06.080> first<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.620> what<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:06.799> want<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.040> do<00:02:07.250> is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
weird at first and what we want to do is

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.800 
weird at first and what we want to do is
out<00:02:08.659> of<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.170> effect<00:02:09.679> under<00:02:10.129> surface<00:02:10.810> there's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
out of this effect under surface there's

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.750 
out of this effect under surface there's
the<00:02:12.230> layer<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.680> we're<00:02:12.830> taking<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.430> bump

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the layer that we're taking this bump

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.210 
the layer that we're taking this bump
map<00:02:14.019> from<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.409> we<00:02:15.500> want<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.709> change<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
map from so we want to change that to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.100 
map from so we want to change that to
our<00:02:16.490> tracer<00:02:16.940> text<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.540> that's<00:02:17.780> going<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:17.990> look

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
our tracer text and that's going to look

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.620 
our tracer text and that's going to look
a<00:02:18.380> little<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:19.970> wanted<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.390> if

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
a little more like what we wanted to if

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.340 
a little more like what we wanted to if
we<00:02:20.750> look<00:02:21.110> at

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
we look at

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.260 
we look at
frame<00:02:21.530> that's<00:02:22.310> not<00:02:22.550> blurred<00:02:22.820> out<00:02:22.940> from<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
frame that's not blurred out from the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.630 
frame that's not blurred out from the
motion<00:02:23.600> blur<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.050> what<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.580> this

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
motion blur and what we can do with this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210 
motion blur and what we can do with this
effect<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.450> adjust<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> amount<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:28.040> that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
effect is adjust the amount of that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.710 
effect is adjust the amount of that
glass<00:02:28.490> eNOS<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.030> refraction<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.600> we're

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
glass eNOS and refraction that we're

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.540 
glass eNOS and refraction that we're
getting<00:02:29.840> it<00:02:30.050> by<00:02:30.200> adjusting<00:02:30.560> things<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
getting it by adjusting things like the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.300 
getting it by adjusting things like the
softness<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.360> height<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.800> get<00:02:33.920> really

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
softness and height so we can get really

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
softness and height so we can get really
bubbly<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.060> refracted<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.780> really<00:02:35.930> take

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
bubbly and refracted and really take

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.690 
bubbly and refracted and really take
away<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> lot<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.800> color<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.250> wanted<00:02:37.550> as

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
away a lot of the color if we wanted as

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.630 
away a lot of the color if we wanted as
well<00:02:38.660> as<00:02:38.870> kind<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.230> soften<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.310> bend<00:02:40.550> it

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
well as kind of soften it and bend it

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.400 
well as kind of soften it and bend it
around<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.180> some<00:02:41.360> cool<00:02:41.630> effects<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.140> can<00:02:42.170> do

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
around so some cool effects you can do

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.350 
around so some cool effects you can do
on<00:02:42.590> an<00:02:42.710> adjustment<00:02:43.100> layer<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.970> effect

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
on an adjustment layer with this effect

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240 
on an adjustment layer with this effect
that<00:02:44.600> works<00:02:45.260> really<00:02:45.440> nicely<00:02:45.770> when<00:02:46.100> we're

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
that works really nicely when we're

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.730 
that works really nicely when we're
talking<00:02:46.370> about<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.700> kind<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:46.940> organic<00:02:47.740> text

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
talking about this kind of organic text

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.710 
talking about this kind of organic text
animation<00:02:49.310> now<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:50.240> we<00:02:50.300> want<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.600> in

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
animation now what we want to do in

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.900 
animation now what we want to do in
addition<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.500> let's<00:02:52.010> grab<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.370> curves

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
addition to that is let's grab a curves

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.940 
addition to that is let's grab a curves
and<00:02:53.240> do<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:54.020> bit<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.200> color<00:02:54.470> correction

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
and do a little bit of color correction

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
and do a little bit of color correction
I'll<00:02:55.100> put<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.400> above<00:02:55.490> our<00:02:55.940> glass<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.810> I'll

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
I'll put that above our glass so I'll

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.290 
I'll put that above our glass so I'll
just<00:02:56.930> pull<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.410> down<00:02:57.710> and<00:02:58.100> push<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:59.000> high

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
just pull this down and push the high

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.000 
just pull this down and push the high
end<00:02:59.450> up<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.870> we<00:02:59.930> can<00:03:00.080> just<00:03:00.230> get<00:03:00.440> a<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.770> bit

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
end up so we can just get a little bit

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.680 
end up so we can just get a little bit
of<00:03:01.040> higher<00:03:01.310> contrast<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:02.150> post-production

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
of higher contrast in post-production

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.110 
of higher contrast in post-production
and<00:03:03.230> now<00:03:03.770> if<00:03:03.890> we<00:03:04.010> scrub<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.610> we<00:03:04.820> can<00:03:04.940> see

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
and now if we scrub through we can see

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.910 
and now if we scrub through we can see
that<00:03:05.330> we're<00:03:05.630> getting<00:03:05.720> more<00:03:06.110> contrast<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:06.800> get

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
that we're getting more contrast we get

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.590 
that we're getting more contrast we get
that<00:03:07.040> glassy<00:03:07.580> effect<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.090> looking<00:03:08.420> really

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that glassy effect it's looking really

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.590 
that glassy effect it's looking really
cool<00:03:08.870> when<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.170> thing<00:03:09.380> snaps<00:03:09.830> around<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
cool when this thing snaps around and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.300 
cool when this thing snaps around and
what<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:11.690> can<00:03:11.870> do<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.860> push<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.190> little

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
what we can do to push this little

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.160 
what we can do to push this little
further<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.420> color<00:03:14.630> cycling

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
further is have the color cycling

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.930 
further is have the color cycling
through<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.650> how<00:03:15.920> we<00:03:16.010> can<00:03:16.070> do<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.460> is<00:03:16.700> on

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
through and how we can do that is on

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.840 
through and how we can do that is on
this<00:03:17.750> adjustment<00:03:18.260> layer<00:03:18.350> or<00:03:18.560> my<00:03:18.950> footage<00:03:19.610> of

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
this adjustment layer or my footage of

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.610 
this adjustment layer or my footage of
my<00:03:20.090> cinema<00:03:20.480> 4d<00:03:20.690> file<00:03:20.960> I'm<00:03:21.200> going<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.410> grab<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
my cinema 4d file I'm going to grab a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.420 
my cinema 4d file I'm going to grab a
hue/saturation<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:23.300> I'll<00:03:23.360> drag<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.960> onto

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
hue/saturation and I'll drag that onto

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.700 
hue/saturation and I'll drag that onto
here<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.660> with<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.810> hue<00:03:27.080> saturation<00:03:27.230> what

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
here and with this hue saturation what

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.190 
here and with this hue saturation what
we<00:03:27.830> want<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.070> do<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.400> get<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.960> change<00:03:29.960> those

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
we want to do to get it to change those

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.620 
we want to do to get it to change those
colors<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.740> check<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.460> colorize<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.800> I'll

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
colors is check on colorize and I'll

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.810 
colors is check on colorize and I'll
look<00:03:35.630> through<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.230> turn<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.010> saturation<00:03:37.490> up

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
look through and turn that saturation up

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.390 
look through and turn that saturation up
a<00:03:38.120> bit<00:03:38.570> so<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.990> is<00:03:39.440> really<00:03:39.680> bringing<00:03:40.070> out<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
a bit so it is really bringing out the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.120 
a bit so it is really bringing out the
brightness<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.940> those<00:03:41.180> colors<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:42.040> what<00:03:43.040> we

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
brightness of those colors and what we

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.910 
brightness of those colors and what we
want<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.490> do<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:44.030> not<00:03:44.600> just<00:03:44.630> change<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.710> to

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
want this to do is not just change it to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.710 
want this to do is not just change it to
a<00:03:46.280> different<00:03:46.610> color<00:03:46.910> but<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.150> want<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.480> cycle

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
a different color but we want to cycle

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.480 
a different color but we want to cycle
through<00:03:47.930> them<00:03:48.290> over<00:03:48.590> time<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:49.040> how<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.220> can<00:03:49.310> do

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
through them over time and how we can do

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.000 
through them over time and how we can do
that<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:50.000> if<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.510> basically<00:03:50.900> want<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.440> run

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
that is if we basically want it to run

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.770 
that is if we basically want it to run
this<00:03:52.310> meter<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.880> whole<00:03:53.030> time<00:03:53.300> but<00:03:53.570> rather

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
this meter the whole time but rather

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.090 
this meter the whole time but rather
than<00:03:54.020> setting<00:03:54.260> keyframes<00:03:54.800> are<00:03:54.920> kind<00:03:55.070> of

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
than setting keyframes are kind of

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.680 
than setting keyframes are kind of
adjusting<00:03:55.520> that<00:03:55.670> what<00:03:55.910> we<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.120> do<00:03:56.270> is<00:03:56.390> add<00:03:56.540> an

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
adjusting that what we can do is add an

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.110 
adjusting that what we can do is add an
expression<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.830> stopwatch<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:59.000> make

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
expression to this stopwatch to make

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.940 
expression to this stopwatch to make
this<00:03:59.240> infinitely<00:03:59.810> cycle<00:04:00.320> through<00:04:00.590> these<00:04:00.770> so

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
this infinitely cycle through these so

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.740 
this infinitely cycle through these so
how<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.340> do<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.550> is<00:04:01.760> by<00:04:02.030> option<00:04:02.480> or<00:04:02.570> alt

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
how we can do that is by option or alt

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.200 
how we can do that is by option or alt
clicking<00:04:03.020> on<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.530> stopwatch<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.520> then

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
clicking on this stopwatch and then

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.840 
clicking on this stopwatch and then
we'll<00:04:05.360> use<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.630> expression<00:04:06.050> time<00:04:06.590> which<00:04:07.580> will

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
we'll use the expression time which will

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.500 
we'll use the expression time which will
link<00:04:08.270> this<00:04:08.720> value<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.820> time<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
link this value to the time in the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.410 
link this value to the time in the
playhead<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.290> at<00:04:12.500> one<00:04:13.010> second<00:04:13.460> it<00:04:13.580> would<00:04:13.700> be<00:04:13.880> 12

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
playhead so at one second it would be 12

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.810 
playhead so at one second it would be 12
seconds<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.930> e2<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.980> can<00:04:16.100> multiply<00:04:16.370> that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
seconds of e2 and we can multiply that

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.090 
seconds of e2 and we can multiply that
by<00:04:16.880> another<00:04:17.330> number<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:17.900> if<00:04:17.960> we<00:04:18.049> do<00:04:18.140> time<00:04:18.410> x<00:04:18.739> 30

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
by another number so if we do time x 30

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.220 
by another number so if we do time x 30
every<00:04:20.000> second<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.570> going<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.870> cycle<00:04:21.049> through

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
every second it's going to cycle through

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.860 
every second it's going to cycle through
30<00:04:22.010> units<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.790> this<00:04:22.940> hue<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.480> then<00:04:23.600> I'll<00:04:23.720> press

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
30 units of this hue and then I'll press

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.290 
30 units of this hue and then I'll press
ENTER<00:04:24.230> and<00:04:24.380> now<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:25.220> we<00:04:25.310> cycle<00:04:25.730> through<00:04:25.760> we<00:04:26.180> can

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
ENTER and now if we cycle through we can

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.390 
ENTER and now if we cycle through we can
see<00:04:26.480> that<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.870> adjusting<00:04:27.590> color<00:04:27.800> over<00:04:28.130> time

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
see that it's adjusting color over time

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.580 
see that it's adjusting color over time
and<00:04:28.700> if<00:04:29.419> we<00:04:29.510> want<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.900> go<00:04:30.020> quicker<00:04:30.350> we

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and if we want that to go quicker we

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.590 
and if we want that to go quicker we
could<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.860> make<00:04:31.640> this<00:04:31.790> number<00:04:32.180> bigger<00:04:32.419> so

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
could just make this number bigger so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.690 
could just make this number bigger so
I'll<00:04:32.660> go<00:04:32.750> time<00:04:33.020> x<00:04:33.350> 50

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
I'll go time x 50

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.010 
I'll go time x 50
and<00:04:34.820> then<00:04:35.300> it's<00:04:35.420> going<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.630> cycle<00:04:35.840> through

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
and then it's going to cycle through

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.590 
and then it's going to cycle through
these<00:04:36.410> much<00:04:37.370> quicker<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.240> can<00:04:38.360> see<00:04:38.480> it

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
these much quicker and you can see it

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.720 
these much quicker and you can see it
creates<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:38.960> pretty<00:04:39.470> cool<00:04:40.070> effect<00:04:40.520> when

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
creates this pretty cool effect when

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.750 
creates this pretty cool effect when
we're<00:04:40.880> combining<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.570> hue<00:04:41.990> saturation

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
we're combining that hue saturation

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.490 
we're combining that hue saturation
expression<00:04:43.760> with<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.270> glass<00:04:44.690> effect<00:04:45.050> on

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
expression with that glass effect on

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.380 
expression with that glass effect on
that<00:04:45.650> adjustment<00:04:46.130> layer<00:04:46.280> one<00:04:46.970> thing<00:04:47.150> we<00:04:47.240> want

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
that adjustment layer one thing we want

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.910 
that adjustment layer one thing we want
to<00:04:47.420> do<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.630> top<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.930> all<00:04:48.110> of<00:04:48.140> this<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.650> add

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
to do on top of all of this is add

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.770 
to do on top of all of this is add
another<00:04:49.460> adjustment<00:04:49.880> layer<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.480> add<00:04:50.570> a<00:04:50.600> nice

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
another adjustment layer to add a nice

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.020 
another adjustment layer to add a nice
vignette<00:04:51.290> always<00:04:51.560> nice<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.980> do<00:04:52.220> on<00:04:52.490> motion

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
vignette always nice to do on motion

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.320 
vignette always nice to do on motion
graphics<00:04:53.650> projects<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:54.830> I'll<00:04:54.890> go<00:04:55.330> another

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
graphics projects so I'll go another

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.450 
graphics projects so I'll go another
adjustment<00:04:56.630> layer<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.470> i'll<00:04:57.620> call<00:04:58.220> this

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
adjustment layer and i'll call this

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.970 
adjustment layer and i'll call this
vignette<00:04:59.420> and<00:04:59.690> on<00:05:00.170> this<00:05:00.500> one<00:05:00.710> I'm<00:05:00.830> going<00:05:00.920> to

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
vignette and on this one I'm going to

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.600 
vignette and on this one I'm going to
grab<00:05:01.510> curves<00:05:02.510> again<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.320> I'm<00:05:04.310> just<00:05:04.430> going<00:05:04.520> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
grab curves again and I'm just going to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.910 
grab curves again and I'm just going to
pull<00:05:04.910> the<00:05:05.420> top<00:05:05.630> point<00:05:05.900> all<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.320> way<00:05:06.410> down<00:05:06.650> so

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
pull the top point all the way down so

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.920 
pull the top point all the way down so
it<00:05:07.010> looks<00:05:07.160> darker<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.820> then<00:05:08.420> we<00:05:08.570> can<00:05:08.690> do<00:05:08.810> to

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
it looks darker and then we can do to

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.080 
it looks darker and then we can do to
block<00:05:09.200> this<00:05:09.380> just<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.040> edges<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.550> grab<00:05:10.820> any

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
block this just the edges is grab any

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.450 
block this just the edges is grab any
lips<00:05:11.390> mask<00:05:11.690> up<00:05:11.960> here<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.440> then<00:05:12.980> just<00:05:13.100> double

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
lips mask up here and then just double

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.800 
lips mask up here and then just double
click<00:05:13.640> on<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.060> that's<00:05:14.330> going<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.510> create<00:05:14.660> a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
click on it and that's going to create a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.050 
click on it and that's going to create a
mask<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.350> then<00:05:15.530> we<00:05:15.650> can<00:05:15.890> invert<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:16.670> mask

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
mask and then we can invert that mask

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.020 
mask and then we can invert that mask
right<00:05:17.360> here<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.840> then<00:05:18.710> press<00:05:18.980> f2<00:05:19.580> feather<00:05:19.820> and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
right here and then press f2 feather and

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.570 
right here and then press f2 feather and
just<00:05:20.210> turn<00:05:20.480> that<00:05:20.510> up<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.170> then<00:05:22.100> we<00:05:22.220> can<00:05:22.370> press

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
just turn that up and then we can press

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.270 
just turn that up and then we can press
T<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.120> just<00:05:23.300> turn<00:05:23.510> down<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.960> opacity<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:25.160> the

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
T and just turn down the opacity of the

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.460 
T and just turn down the opacity of the
whole<00:05:25.430> layer<00:05:25.820> now<00:05:26.630> the<00:05:26.690> last<00:05:27.020> thing<00:05:27.140> we<00:05:27.290> want

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
whole layer now the last thing we want

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.250 
whole layer now the last thing we want
to<00:05:27.500> do<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:27.830> have<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:29.300> glass<00:05:29.660> kind<00:05:29.990> of<00:05:30.050> turn

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
to do is have that glass kind of turn

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.230 
to do is have that glass kind of turn
off<00:05:30.470> so<00:05:30.650> we<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:30.830> actually<00:05:31.190> read<00:05:31.520> this<00:05:31.730> text<00:05:32.120> at

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
off so we can actually read this text at

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.790 
off so we can actually read this text at
the<00:05:32.360> end<00:05:32.510> we<00:05:32.600> can<00:05:32.720> see<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:32.930> comes<00:05:33.230> here<00:05:33.530> and

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
the end we can see it comes here and

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.980 
the end we can see it comes here and
then<00:05:34.070> it's<00:05:34.250> kind<00:05:34.430> of<00:05:34.460> unreadable<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.210> that's

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
then it's kind of unreadable and that's

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.260 
then it's kind of unreadable and that's
why<00:05:36.170> we<00:05:36.200> set<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:36.710> glass<00:05:37.550> on<00:05:37.790> an<00:05:37.880> adjustment

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
why we set this glass on an adjustment

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.820 
why we set this glass on an adjustment
layer<00:05:38.390> because<00:05:38.810> we<00:05:38.930> can't<00:05:39.140> just<00:05:39.440> turn<00:05:39.650> off<00:05:39.710> the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
layer because we can't just turn off the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.980 
layer because we can't just turn off the
opacity<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.430> that<00:05:40.520> adjustment<00:05:41.210> layer<00:05:41.330> so<00:05:41.570> for

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
opacity of that adjustment layer so for

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.450 
opacity of that adjustment layer so for
that<00:05:42.110> glass<00:05:42.530> adjustment<00:05:43.100> layer<00:05:43.190> I'm<00:05:43.250> going<00:05:43.310> to

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
that glass adjustment layer I'm going to

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.450 
that glass adjustment layer I'm going to
press<00:05:43.760> T<00:05:44.000> again<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.600> I'll<00:05:45.290> set<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> keyframe

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
press T again and I'll set a keyframe

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.300 
press T again and I'll set a keyframe
for<00:05:46.700> opacity<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:47.630> then<00:05:47.780> I'll<00:05:47.870> go<00:05:47.990> ahead<00:05:48.350> 20

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
for opacity and then I'll go ahead 20

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.340 
for opacity and then I'll go ahead 20
frames<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:50.060> I'll<00:05:50.150> set<00:05:50.360> another<00:05:50.630> one<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.170> turn

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
frames and I'll set another one and turn

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.250 
frames and I'll set another one and turn
it<00:05:51.500> down<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:52.190> zero<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.790> then<00:05:53.630> I'll<00:05:53.750> just<00:05:53.930> use

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
it down to zero and then I'll just use

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.500 
it down to zero and then I'll just use
that<00:05:54.380> it<00:05:54.680> just<00:05:54.890> so<00:05:54.980> it<00:05:55.010> smoothly<00:05:55.880> goes<00:05:56.240> in<00:05:56.390> we

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
that it just so it smoothly goes in we

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.210 
that it just so it smoothly goes in we
don't<00:05:56.660> see<00:05:56.780> any<00:05:56.990> bumps<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:57.800> then<00:05:57.980> it's<00:05:58.130> going

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
don't see any bumps and then it's going

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.250 
don't see any bumps and then it's going
to<00:05:58.310> play<00:05:59.030> through<00:05:59.390> this<00:05:59.540> cycle<00:05:59.780> through<00:06:00.230> all

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
to play through this cycle through all

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.070 
to play through this cycle through all
these<00:06:00.470> get<00:06:00.710> that<00:06:00.860> nice<00:06:01.160> glass<00:06:02.120> effect<00:06:02.480> and

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
these get that nice glass effect and

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.560 
these get that nice glass effect and
then<00:06:03.650> when<00:06:03.800> we<00:06:03.950> get<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.700> hear<00:06:04.880> need<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.210> read<00:06:05.420> it

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
then when we get to hear need to read it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.690 
then when we get to hear need to read it
it's<00:06:05.720> going<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:05.930> shut<00:06:06.860> off<00:06:07.010> that<00:06:07.040> adjustment

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
it's going to shut off that adjustment

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.780 
it's going to shut off that adjustment
layer<00:06:07.850> and<00:06:08.320> then<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.500> will<00:06:09.620> reveal<00:06:10.070> our<00:06:10.370> text

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
layer and then it will reveal our text

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.070 
layer and then it will reveal our text
and<00:06:10.910> if<00:06:11.000> we<00:06:11.060> wanted<00:06:11.270> that<00:06:11.420> to<00:06:11.510> be<00:06:11.540> kind<00:06:11.990> of

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
and if we wanted that to be kind of

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.450 
and if we wanted that to be kind of
shorter<00:06:12.500> we<00:06:12.680> could<00:06:12.890> tighten<00:06:13.190> up<00:06:13.280> those

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
shorter we could tighten up those

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.850 
shorter we could tighten up those
keyframes<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.150> bit<00:06:14.330> so<00:06:14.840> we<00:06:14.960> don't<00:06:15.170> see<00:06:15.410> that

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
keyframes a bit so we don't see that

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.270 
keyframes a bit so we don't see that
transition<00:06:16.720> so<00:06:17.720> that<00:06:17.750> is<00:06:18.260> it<00:06:18.500> we<00:06:18.620> got<00:06:18.770> our<00:06:18.920> text

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
transition so that is it we got our text

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.980 
transition so that is it we got our text
flying<00:06:19.490> around<00:06:19.700> we<00:06:19.850> get<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.120> nice<00:06:20.390> cool

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
flying around we get this nice cool

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.900 
flying around we get this nice cool
glass<00:06:21.350> effect<00:06:21.710> on<00:06:22.070> and<00:06:22.250> it's<00:06:22.340> cycling<00:06:22.700> through

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
glass effect on and it's cycling through

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.120 
glass effect on and it's cycling through
colors<00:06:23.060> and<00:06:23.420> then<00:06:23.600> snaps<00:06:23.960> together<00:06:24.200> so<00:06:24.860> I<00:06:24.890> hope

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
colors and then snaps together so I hope

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.190 
colors and then snaps together so I hope
you<00:06:25.310> enjoyed<00:06:25.730> this<00:06:25.970> one<00:06:26.210> it's<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:26.480> good<00:06:26.720> example

you enjoyed this one it's a good example
of<00:06:27.350> a<00:06:27.530> lot<00:06:27.740> of<00:06:27.890> stuff<00:06:28.070> we<00:06:28.220> could<00:06:28.310> do<00:06:28.430> in<00:06:28.520> the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
of a lot of stuff we could do in the

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.970 
of a lot of stuff we could do in the
first<00:06:28.790> part<00:06:29.000> in<00:06:29.150> cinema<00:06:29.600> 4d<00:06:29.630> and<00:06:30.200> then<00:06:30.800> just

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
first part in cinema 4d and then just

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.190 
first part in cinema 4d and then just
show<00:06:31.220> how<00:06:31.400> you<00:06:31.460> can<00:06:31.700> connect<00:06:32.240> cinema<00:06:32.690> 4d<00:06:32.930> with

show how you can connect cinema 4d with

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.570 
show how you can connect cinema 4d with
After<00:06:33.500> Effects<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:33.800> do<00:06:33.950> some<00:06:34.070> cool<00:06:34.280> post
