00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.410 
edition just the unlimited version and
i'm<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.460> surprised<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> came<00:02:00.119> back<00:02:00.360> as

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

an<00:02:00.750> eight<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> figured<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.469> would<00:02:01.590> score<00:02:01.829> lower

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
an eight I figured it would score lower

an eight I figured it would score lower
probably<00:02:02.520> closer<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> seven<00:02:03.299> or<00:02:03.360> six<00:02:03.719> but
