00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.480
 Hi, I'm back from the studio in Mara. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.540
 today with a tip for you guys that want 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.640
 and are afraid fear because the 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.220
 Hair getting damaged gets smashed 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.650
 This can be so if you do not 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.870
 took the necessary care 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.600
 look for a good professional who has the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.040
 ability and the brothers products and you 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.040
 will stay with the body 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.660
 I'll explain what I did in the 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.230
 hair of rafaela rafaela has a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.650
 dark brown hair 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.900
 I chose the wicks marked because 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.150
 She told me that she always wanted to be 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.640
 blonde and wants to continue being blonde for 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.220
 a good time what happens with 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.799
 wicks marked 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.490
 it is easy to touch up 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.640
 I go every time I touch every 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.340
 I'll always get the same wicks because 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.340
 they are already marked but not 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.500
 unmarked subject does not mean that the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.510
 Your hair is going to be marked not it goes 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.650
 to be stained marked on the sound 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.690
 We are professionals to meet in the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.030
 time to make the strands and not 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.700
 greeting that already has a hair for 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.740
 chemically treated by more than one 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 being well taken care of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.950
 it is not the same fiber anymore so I go 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.950
 always retouch the same average 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.900
 I separated another strand I did not work 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.900
 and the second mecha works the whole thing 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.400
 can see it is not sewn is in the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:07.150
 diagonal and every time I go to work 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.520
 rafaela's hair is going to be just the 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.800
 hair I've ever gotten unless 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.000
 She wants to get more blonde is more 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.360
 easy too, right? 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.400
 but I'll always touch the same and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.410
 I'll touch up your growing part. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.260
 doing so with the hair that already 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.590
 was chemically treated refers to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 a beautiful blonde hair treated with 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.700
 brightness and balance 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.790
 and this is it girls 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.250

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.090
