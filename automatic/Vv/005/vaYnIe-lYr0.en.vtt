00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.580 
know packing or something like that but
there's<00:00:30.119> some<00:00:30.269> room<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.109> wanted<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.410> put

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
there's some room if they wanted to put

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.319 
there's some room if they wanted to put
in<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> game<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.310 

except<00:00:39.329> they<00:00:39.450> wanted<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.079> bundles

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
except they wanted to do some bundles

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.220 
except they wanted to do some bundles
look<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.280> easily<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.820> fits<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.300> I'm

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
look at how easily that fits in I'm

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.510 
look at how easily that fits in I'm
guessing<00:00:43.559> that's<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.920> they're<00:00:44.250> gonna<00:00:44.309> be

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
guessing that's what they're gonna be

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.479 
guessing that's what they're gonna be
doing<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> final<00:00:46.410> fantasy<00:00:46.860> x<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
doing for like the final fantasy x and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
doing for like the final fantasy x and
x2<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:48.180> Japan<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.340> let's<00:00:51.320> go<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.949> all

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
x2 on Japan so let's go just all

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
x2 on Japan so let's go just all
standard<00:00:53.489> stuff<00:00:53.550> again<00:00:54.059> usually<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.350> used

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
standard stuff again usually they used

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.260 
standard stuff again usually they used
to<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> plastic<00:00:56.699> bag<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to have this in like a plastic bag but

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
to have this in like a plastic bag but
there's<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> throwing<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.949> stuff<00:00:59.160> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there's kind of throwing this stuff in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
there's kind of throwing this stuff in
there<00:00:59.489> but<00:00:59.520> I<00:01:00.140> think<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.230> figured<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.649> no

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
there but I think they figured out no

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.310 
there but I think they figured out no
one<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.129> cares<00:01:04.369> all<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.960> let's<00:01:06.960> pull

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one really cares all right let's pull

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.300 
one really cares all right let's pull
out<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.740> sucker<00:01:09.439> do<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.590> best<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> touch

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
out this sucker do my best not to touch

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.380 
out this sucker do my best not to touch
screen<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> protector<00:01:13.350> goes<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.740> there

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
screen for the protector goes on there

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.859 
screen for the protector goes on there
all<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.820> light<00:01:18.119> blue

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.210 

again<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.990> trying<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> gauge<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> person

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
again I'm trying to gauge it in person

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
again I'm trying to gauge it in person
actually<00:01:23.520> looks<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> lot<00:01:23.850> better<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.119> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
actually looks a lot better than I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.649 
actually looks a lot better than I
thought<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.080> looked<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.439> videos<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> in

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
thought I looked in videos and in

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630 
thought I looked in videos and in
pictures<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.259> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> thinking<00:01:29.340> about

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
pictures I was kind of thinking about

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
pictures I was kind of thinking about
just<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.180> white<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.990> figured<00:01:31.619> if

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
just going all white but I figured if

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
just going all white but I figured if
I'm<00:01:31.829> gonna<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.909> Japanese<00:01:33.479> videos<00:01:33.840> I

I'm gonna get you know Japanese videos I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
I'm gonna get you know Japanese videos I
might<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.229> well<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.340> probably<00:01:35.640> gonna

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
might as well get but are probably gonna

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
might as well get but are probably gonna
be<00:01:35.850> exclusive<00:01:36.570> colors<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:38.460> again<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
be exclusive colors and again it just it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
be exclusive colors and again it just it
feels<00:01:40.710> really<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.220> good<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.640> can't<00:01:41.939> wait<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
feels really really good I can't wait to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.170 
feels really really good I can't wait to
get<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.509> transfer<00:01:42.960> done<00:01:44.000> another<00:01:45.000> thing

the screen and if you feel it there's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.150 
the screen and if you feel it there's
actually<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.350> indentation

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
actually a like a little indentation

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.980 
actually a like a little indentation
there<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.430> stays<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.030> still<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.390> flat<00:02:24.780> though

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
there it stays it still is flat though

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.220 
there it stays it still is flat though
it's<00:02:25.140> not<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.590> pops<00:02:25.860> off<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it's not like it pops off the the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's not like it pops off the the
console<00:02:29.040> or<00:02:29.130> anything<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.460> little<00:02:29.700> bezel

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
console or anything that little bezel

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.330

you<00:02:31.590> know<00:02:31.710> it<00:02:31.860> still<00:02:32.780> looks<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:33.990> offer<00:02:34.680> or

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
you know it still looks will offer or

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.010 
you know it still looks will offer or
whatever<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.330> at<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.840> end<00:02:36.960> of

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
whatever but I think it at the end of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.040 
whatever but I think it at the end of
the<00:02:37.110> day<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:39.540> not<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> matter

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
the day it's really not going to matter

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.300 
the day it's really not going to matter
and<00:02:40.770> again<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:42.240> just<00:02:42.390> again<00:02:42.810> from<00:02:43.080> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and again this is just again from the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.580 
and again this is just again from the
having<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> matte<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.450> again<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.440> I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
having the matte back here again this I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.900 
having the matte back here again this I
think<00:02:46.830> another<00:02:47.040> model<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.760> not

think another model that's just not
gonna<00:02:48.120> ever<00:02:48.240> show<00:02:48.480> fingerprints<00:02:48.990> unlike<00:02:49.350> the
