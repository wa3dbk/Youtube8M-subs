00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
our past headphones were derived from

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.750 
our past headphones were derived from
the<00:00:41.329> boss<00:00:41.480> texty<00:00:41.989> of<00:00:42.050> FDR<00:00:42.559> team<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.100> modifying

the boss texty of FDR team and modifying
those<00:00:43.999> this<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.079> our<00:00:45.199> first<00:00:45.440> headphone

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
those this is our first headphone

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.829 
those this is our first headphone
totally<00:00:46.249> designed<00:00:46.579> in-house<00:00:46.940> as<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.570> new

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
totally designed in-house as a new

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.279 
totally designed in-house as a new
driver<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.670> magnet<00:00:50.059> array<00:00:50.269> everything<00:00:51.079> about

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
driver the magnet array everything about

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.340 
driver the magnet array everything about
its<00:00:51.730> proprietary<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:52.969> in-house<00:00:53.239> design<00:00:53.600> the

its proprietary and in-house design the
whole<00:00:54.530> headphone<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.069> metal<00:00:55.399> with<00:00:55.640> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
whole headphone is metal with the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.729 
whole headphone is metal with the
exception<00:00:55.999> of<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.539> plastic<00:00:57.019> ring<00:00:57.229> on<00:00:57.409> the<00:00:57.530> cup

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
exception of the plastic ring on the cup

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.399 
exception of the plastic ring on the cup
here<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.940> couple<00:00:59.300> small<00:00:59.510> plastic<00:00:59.870> parts

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
here and a couple small plastic parts

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.669 
here and a couple small plastic parts
but<00:01:01.069> it<00:01:01.100> only<00:01:01.309> weighs<00:01:01.579> 370<00:01:02.089> grams<00:01:02.479> yeah<00:01:03.199> very

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
but it only weighs 370 grams yeah very

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.030 
but it only weighs 370 grams yeah very
very<00:01:04.250> nice<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.699> light<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:06.500> way<00:01:06.650> we<00:01:06.860> were<00:01:06.950> able

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
very nice and light the way we were able

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.069 
very nice and light the way we were able
to<00:01:07.220> do<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.880> to<00:01:07.909> follow<00:01:08.270> first<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:08.930> as<00:01:09.049> a

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
to do that is to follow first we as a

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.740 
to do that is to follow first we as a
single-ended<00:01:09.649> magnet<00:01:10.189> array

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
single-ended magnet array

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.810 
single-ended magnet array
so<00:01:10.900> it<00:01:11.020> reduces<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.620> magnets<00:01:12.010> lose<00:01:12.100> weight<00:01:12.610> by

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
so it reduces the magnets lose weight by

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.820 
so it reduces the magnets lose weight by
about<00:01:12.970> half<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.990> second<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.440> we<00:01:14.560> have<00:01:14.710> this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
about half the second is we have this

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.800 
about half the second is we have this
knit<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.220> all<00:01:15.340> memory<00:01:15.730> metalhead<00:01:16.240> fans<00:01:16.480> so

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
knit to all memory metalhead fans so

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.870 
knit to all memory metalhead fans so
it's<00:01:16.960> really<00:01:17.170> flexible<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.040> has<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.550> really

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
it's really flexible and has a really

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120 
it's really flexible and has a really
nice<00:01:19.150> feel<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.810> plan<00:01:20.320> of<00:01:20.500> course<00:01:20.710> it's<00:01:20.950> kind

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
nice feel to a plan of course it's kind

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.610 
nice feel to a plan of course it's kind
of<00:01:21.190> like<00:01:21.310> never<00:01:21.970> too<00:01:22.210> hard<00:01:22.479> not<00:01:22.780> too<00:01:22.840> soft<00:01:23.050> it

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
of like never too hard not too soft it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.790 
of like never too hard not too soft it
stays<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:23.860> place<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:24.520> it<00:01:24.640> suits<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
stays in place but it suits for the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.150 
stays in place but it suits for the
driver<00:01:27.040> it's<00:01:27.670> actually<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:28.840> kind<00:01:29.619> of<00:01:29.770> different

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
driver it's actually a kind of different

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800 
driver it's actually a kind of different
drivers<00:01:30.610> as<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.150> mentioned<00:01:31.479> before<00:01:31.510> it's

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
drivers as I mentioned before it's

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.400 
drivers as I mentioned before it's
single-ended<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.100> drivers<00:01:34.000> configure<00:01:34.510> 8<00:01:34.660> can

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
single-ended the drivers configure 8 can

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.770 
single-ended the drivers configure 8 can
be<00:01:35.440> configured<00:01:35.860> either<00:01:36.190> as<00:01:36.400> 20<00:01:36.760> 20<00:01:36.940> more<00:01:37.300> an<00:01:37.390> 88

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
be configured either as 20 20 more an 88

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.770 
be configured either as 20 20 more an 88
on<00:01:38.160> we<00:01:39.160> chose<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.430> go<00:01:39.670> with<00:01:39.700> 22<00:01:40.240> ohms<00:01:40.420> because

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
on we chose to go with 22 ohms because

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.270 
on we chose to go with 22 ohms because
that<00:01:40.960> gave<00:01:41.080> us<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.410> high<00:01:41.680> degree<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.950> efficiency

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
that gave us a high degree of efficiency

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.330 
that gave us a high degree of efficiency
so<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.940> headphone<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.509> now<00:01:43.630> run<00:01:43.869> at<00:01:44.050> about<00:01:44.340> 96

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
so the headphone can now run at about 96

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.880 
so the headphone can now run at about 96
95<00:01:45.880> DB<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.420> efficiency<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.380> can<00:01:47.590> be<00:01:47.680> run<00:01:47.860> on

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
95 DB of efficiency so it can be run on

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.930 
95 DB of efficiency so it can be run on
pretty<00:01:48.190> much<00:01:48.310> any<00:01:48.550> headphone<00:01:49.030> device<00:01:49.330> huh<00:01:50.050> in

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
pretty much any headphone device huh in

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.010 
pretty much any headphone device huh in
well<00:01:51.940> cool<00:01:52.119> i'm<00:01:52.240> gonna<00:01:52.360> have<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.509> try<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.780> right
