there's actually no 1% sync challenge in
this<00:00:08.160> mission<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.639> figured<00:00:09.000> it'd<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.150> worth

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
this mission but I figured it'd be worth

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.209 
this mission but I figured it'd be worth
doing<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> little<00:00:10.110> voiceover<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.040> just

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
doing a little voiceover for this just

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.039 
doing a little voiceover for this just
to<00:00:11.280> kind<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.490> explain<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:12.480> new<00:00:12.750> mode

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
to kind of explain how this new mode

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.289 
to kind of explain how this new mode
works<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> basically<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> tower<00:00:14.759> defense

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
works this is basically a tower defense

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.760 
works this is basically a tower defense
mode<00:00:15.680> and<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.250> nearly<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:18.770> interesting

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
mode and it's not nearly as interesting

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.359 
mode and it's not nearly as interesting
as<00:00:19.920> most<00:00:20.400> tower<00:00:20.699> defense<00:00:21.090> games<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:22.189> there<00:00:23.189> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
as most tower defense games are there is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.339 
as most tower defense games are there is
no<00:00:24.439> sneaking<00:00:26.119> involved<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.050> you're

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
no sneaking involved in this if you're

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.750 
no sneaking involved in this if you're
if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> play<00:00:28.859> tower<00:00:29.070> defense<00:00:29.340> games<00:00:29.580> before

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
if you play tower defense games before

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.110 
if you play tower defense games before
you<00:00:30.210> know<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.489> one<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.640> challenges

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
you know that like one of the challenges

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.040 
you know that like one of the challenges
in<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.480> finding<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.670> building<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> path<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
in it is finding in building the path to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.520 
in it is finding in building the path to
maximize<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.550> time<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.629> enemies<00:00:40.230> are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
maximize the time that your enemies are

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.560 
maximize the time that your enemies are
going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> spend<00:00:41.309> before<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
going to spend before they get to the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
going to spend before they get to the
final<00:00:42.719> goal<00:00:43.079> there's<00:00:43.590> none<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.340> all

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
final goal there's none of that at all

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.540 
final goal there's none of that at all
in<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> I'll<00:00:47.879> explain<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
in this so I'll explain what is in this

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
in this so I'll explain what is in this
basically<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.570> put

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
basically what you have to do is you put

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.299 
basically what you have to do is you put
the<00:00:52.280> Templar<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> assassin<00:00:54.270> captains<00:00:54.809> on

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
the Templar or the assassin captains on

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.689 
the Templar or the assassin captains on
each<00:00:56.309> roof<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> put<00:00:58.699> archers

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
each roof that you want to put archers

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.650 
each roof that you want to put archers
and<00:01:00.059> other<00:01:00.800> killing<00:01:01.800> units<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> top<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and other killing units on top of the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.080 
and other killing units on top of the
captains<00:01:04.260> also<00:01:04.710> generate<00:01:05.280> income<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
captains also generate income for you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.320 
captains also generate income for you
slowly<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> lot<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
slowly but not a lot it's not really

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
slowly but not a lot it's not really
like<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> only<00:01:10.500> build<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> very

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like and you can only build a very

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
like and you can only build a very
limited<00:01:11.460> amount<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.630> only<00:01:12.890> on

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
limited amount of them there's only on

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
limited amount of them there's only on
this<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.509> three<00:01:15.780> different

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this one I think there's three different

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.340 
this one I think there's three different
rooftops<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.950> put<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:18.740> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
rooftops that you can put them on and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.510 
rooftops that you can put them on and
you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.590> generate<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.280> little

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you know they generate very little

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
you know they generate very little
income<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:25.110> almost<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
income so like they're almost a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
income so like they're almost a
non-factor<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> second<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
non-factor the second thing is you have

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
non-factor the second thing is you have
those<00:01:28.020> archers<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.770> put<00:01:28.979> three<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
those archers and you can put three of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819 
those archers and you can put three of
them<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> group<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.990> rooftops<00:01:31.590> where

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
them to a group only on rooftops where

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
them to a group only on rooftops where
you<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.490> temp<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> captain's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you have the temp are the the captain's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
you have the temp are the the captain's
so<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> can't<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.619> put<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:34.950> thousands<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so you can't just put them thousands of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.130 
so you can't just put them thousands of
them<00:01:35.939> down<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.299> there's<00:01:36.420> only<00:01:36.540> there's<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
them down then there's only there's a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.300 
them down then there's only there's a
very<00:01:37.350> limited<00:01:37.470> amount<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.950> space<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
very limited amount of space that you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
very limited amount of space that you
can<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.610> them<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.720> groups<00:01:39.869> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
can put them on in little groups of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.280 
can put them on in little groups of
three<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.009> also<00:01:41.130> build<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.490> walls<00:01:42.290> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
three you can also build these walls to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.359 
three you can also build these walls to
slow<00:01:43.710> down<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> progress<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:47.070> enemies

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
slow down the progress of the enemies

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.410 
slow down the progress of the enemies
that<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.670> progressing<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.299> will

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that are progressing because they will

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
that are progressing because they will
have<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.659> destroy<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> walls<00:01:49.290> before<00:01:49.909> they

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
have to destroy the walls before they

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.569 
have to destroy the walls before they
make<00:01:51.119> any<00:01:51.149> further<00:01:51.509> progress<00:01:51.720> um

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
make any further progress um

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
make any further progress um
Ezio<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:53.939> use<00:01:54.240> his<00:01:54.390> gun<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.229> kill

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
Ezio can also use his gun to kill

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.950 
Ezio can also use his gun to kill
enemies<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.399> coming<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.630> by<00:01:57.780> hitting

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
enemies that are coming just by hitting

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.630 
enemies that are coming just by hitting
X<00:01:58.369> infinite<00:01:59.369> ammo<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> big<00:02:00.149> deal

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
X infinite ammo not a big deal

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.450 
X infinite ammo not a big deal

um if you hold down left bumper you can
have<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> much<00:02:15.720> larger<00:02:16.230> cannon<00:02:17.070> barrage<00:02:17.400> come

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
have a much larger cannon barrage come

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.490 
have a much larger cannon barrage come
down<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> top<00:02:18.870> left<00:02:19.050> corner<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.350> can

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
down but in the top left corner you can

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.840 
down but in the top left corner you can
see<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:22.080> only<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.650> three<00:02:23.160> total<00:02:23.430> cannon

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
see you only have three total cannon

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.220 
see you only have three total cannon
shots<00:02:24.060> it's<00:02:24.210> just<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.570> calling<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.110> your

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
shots it's just like calling in your

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.770 
shots it's just like calling in your
assassins<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.920> you've<00:02:26.100> played<00:02:26.280> other

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
assassins if you've played other

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.420 
assassins if you've played other
Assassin's<00:02:27.780> Creed<00:02:28.080> games<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.680> last<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.160> think

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
Assassin's Creed games the last I think

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.920 
Assassin's Creed games the last I think
this<00:02:29.970> hasn't<00:02:30.270> screwed<00:02:30.450> Brotherhood

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
this hasn't screwed Brotherhood

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.250 
this hasn't screwed Brotherhood
introduced<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:31.860> new<00:02:32.160> concept<00:02:33.260> anyone

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
introduced that new concept anyone

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.750 
introduced that new concept anyone
similar<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.070> kind<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> recharges

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
similar to that it kind of recharges

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
similar to that it kind of recharges
slowly<00:02:36.030> over<00:02:36.360> time<00:02:39.890> yeah<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:40.920> basically<00:02:41.250> just

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
slowly over time yeah so basically just

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.160 
slowly over time yeah so basically just
keep<00:02:41.850> building<00:02:43.850> different<00:02:46.580> archers<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.170> when

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
keep building different archers and when

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
keep building different archers and when
you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.620> you're<00:02:50.010> gonna<00:02:50.100> want<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> build<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
you can you're gonna want to build a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.560 
you can you're gonna want to build a
whole<00:02:51.120> bunch<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.900> riflemen<00:02:52.830> because<00:02:53.570> killing

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
whole bunch of riflemen because killing

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.530 
whole bunch of riflemen because killing
all<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.140> ground<00:02:55.650> units<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.880> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
all the ground units is not the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
all the ground units is not the
challenge<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.490> of<00:02:59.580> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
challenge at all and this is one of the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.340 
challenge at all and this is one of the
reasons<00:02:59.910> that<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.450> do<00:03:00.600> not<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.960> this

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
reasons that I really do not like this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.780 
reasons that I really do not like this
mode<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:01.860> all<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:03.240> because<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:04.560> first<00:03:05.360> 95%<00:03:06.360> of

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
mode at all is because the first 95% of

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.340 
mode at all is because the first 95% of
these<00:03:08.790> tower<00:03:09.630> defense<00:03:09.870> things<00:03:10.140> are

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
these tower defense things are

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.800 
these tower defense things are
incredibly<00:03:10.980> simple<00:03:11.400> provide<00:03:11.940> no<00:03:12.330> challenge

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
incredibly simple provide no challenge

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.650 
incredibly simple provide no challenge
whatsoever<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> last<00:03:14.370> 5%<00:03:14.730> there

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
whatsoever and then the last 5% there

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.199 
whatsoever and then the last 5% there
will<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.900> huge<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:17.520> battering<00:03:18.000> ram

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
will be a huge like battering ram

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
will be a huge like battering ram
vehicle<00:03:18.870> basically<00:03:19.350> that's<00:03:19.530> gonna<00:03:19.650> come<00:03:19.980> in

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
vehicle basically that's gonna come in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.930 
vehicle basically that's gonna come in
and<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:22.470> mow<00:03:22.770> through<00:03:23.130> all<00:03:23.310> your<00:03:23.459> defenses

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and just mow through all your defenses

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.790 
and just mow through all your defenses
and<00:03:24.000> they're<00:03:24.330> incredibly<00:03:24.870> hard<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.200> kill<00:03:25.410> so

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
and they're incredibly hard to kill so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.420 
and they're incredibly hard to kill so
the<00:03:26.700> challenge<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.570> these<00:03:27.810> are<00:03:28.430> extremely

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
the challenge of these are extremely

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.350 
the challenge of these are extremely
back-loaded

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
back-loaded

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.540 
back-loaded
and<00:03:30.530> like<00:03:31.530> you're<00:03:31.709> completely<00:03:32.220> unprepared

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
and like you're completely unprepared

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.600 
and like you're completely unprepared
for<00:03:32.970> when<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.570> final<00:03:34.050> tank<00:03:34.920> thing<00:03:35.220> comes

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
for when this final tank thing comes

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.860 
for when this final tank thing comes
through<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:38.670> can<00:03:39.060> also<00:03:39.180> upgrade<00:03:39.510> your

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
through so you can also upgrade your

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.370 
through so you can also upgrade your
defenses<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.709> takes<00:03:40.920> longer<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:42.860> your

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
defenses so it takes longer for your

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.110 
defenses so it takes longer for your
barricades<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:46.530> fall<00:03:46.820> definitely<00:03:47.820> do<00:03:47.970> that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
barricades to fall definitely do that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.479 
barricades to fall definitely do that
and<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.930> build<00:03:49.110> tons<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.650> riflemen<00:03:50.040> like<00:03:50.310> you

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
and it's build tons of riflemen like you

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.520 
and it's build tons of riflemen like you
know<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:51.000> if<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:51.750> play<00:03:51.900> tower<00:03:52.140> defense<00:03:52.350> games

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
know and if you play tower defense games

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.449 
know and if you play tower defense games
before<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> there's<00:03:53.340> like

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
before you know that there's like

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
before you know that there's like
different<00:03:53.640> kinds<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.180> units<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> riflemen<00:03:55.080> do

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
different kinds of units the riflemen do

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.900 
different kinds of units the riflemen do
more<00:03:55.500> damage<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.370> they<00:03:56.580> fire<00:03:56.850> slower<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.850> I

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
more damage but they fire slower and I

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.030 
more damage but they fire slower and I
think<00:04:00.090> they<00:04:00.150> do<00:04:00.209> more<00:04:00.420> damage<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.530> armored

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.190 

big<00:04:05.040> tank<00:04:05.340> thing<00:04:05.519> that<00:04:05.670> comes<00:04:05.820> along<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.330> if

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
big tank thing that comes along and if

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.250 
big tank thing that comes along and if
you<00:04:07.410> play<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.340> smart<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.780> I'll<00:04:09.900> explain<00:04:10.140> this

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
you play it smart and I'll explain this

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.630 
you play it smart and I'll explain this
how<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:10.950> works<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> different<00:04:11.400> video

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
how this works in a different video

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.580 
how this works in a different video
you'll<00:04:11.910> never<00:04:12.209> have<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.660> do<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:12.959> mode<00:04:13.230> again

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
you'll never have to do this mode again

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.350 
you'll never have to do this mode again
for<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.010> rest<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.430> game<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:14.850> may<00:04:14.970> want<00:04:15.300> to

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
for the rest of the game you may want to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.789
