00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.780 
so there you have a braid with the
ribbon<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.740> then<00:03:20.950> all<00:03:21.190> you're<00:03:21.370> going<00:03:21.460> to<00:03:21.520> do

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
ribbon and then all you're going to do

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:33.290 
ribbon and then all you're going to do
is<00:03:22.170> twist<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:24.550> would<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.730> regular<00:03:24.820> bun

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.370 

then<00:03:34.300> take<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> bobby<00:03:35.080> pin<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:36.420> secure<00:03:37.420> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
then take a bobby pin and secure the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.580 
then take a bobby pin and secure the
hair<00:03:41.250> just<00:03:42.250> try<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.490> hide<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:42.790> under<00:03:43.210> there<00:03:43.590> but

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
hair just try to hide it under there but

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.440 
hair just try to hide it under there but
you<00:03:44.680> don't<00:03:44.800> see<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.850> need<00:03:46.000> another<00:03:46.120> one

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
you don't see it if you need another one

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.140 
you don't see it if you need another one
you<00:03:46.600> can<00:03:46.630> use<00:03:47.070> another<00:03:48.070> one<00:03:48.310> for<00:03:48.520> any<00:03:48.730> flyaways

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
you can use another one for any flyaways

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.550 
you can use another one for any flyaways
and<00:03:52.140> then<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.620> take<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.100> ribbon<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:56.260> tie

it<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.870> knot<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.560> then<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.820> just<00:04:00.970> make<00:04:01.209> a

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
