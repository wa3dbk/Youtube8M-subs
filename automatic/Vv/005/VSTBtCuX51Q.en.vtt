00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
that manually swap and there we go
so<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.869> an<00:02:10.050> infinite<00:02:10.319> ammo<00:02:11.300> healing

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so now we have an infinite ammo healing

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.320 
so now we have an infinite ammo healing

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
class as for the infinite ammo it only

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.850 
class as for the infinite ammo it only
works<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:21.810> guns<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.020> only<00:02:23.230> consume<00:02:23.650> one

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
works with guns that only consume one

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.770 
works with guns that only consume one
bullet<00:02:24.100> they<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.880> see<00:02:25.030> more<00:02:25.270> than<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.540> it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
bullet they can see more than that it

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.830 
bullet they can see more than that it
will<00:02:25.870> only<00:02:26.080> reduce<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.010> by<00:02:27.130> one<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.630> yeah

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
will only reduce it by one so yeah

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
will only reduce it by one so yeah
anyway<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.860> has<00:02:30.010> been<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> quick<00:02:30.370> little
