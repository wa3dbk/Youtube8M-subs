00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the fire I mean I think a lot of that

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.759 
the fire I mean I think a lot of that
stuff<00:00:23.730> should<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> team<00:00:25.140> goes<00:00:25.410> as

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
stuff should be you know a team goes as

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
stuff should be you know a team goes as
as<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.519> guards<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> back

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
as the guards go you know as a back

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.740 
as the guards go you know as a back
court<00:00:28.140> because<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.560> handle<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> ball<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:30.240> lot

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
court because we handle the ball a lot

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
court because we handle the ball a lot
of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> greater<00:00:31.170> players<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> league<00:00:31.830> our

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of the greater players in the league our

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.569 
of the greater players in the league our
guards<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:35.460> your

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
guards and you know I think when your

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
guards and you know I think when your
team<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.850> good<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:36.840> how<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> get

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
team is good then that's how you get

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.700 
team is good then that's how you get
that<00:00:37.649> type<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> respect<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.730> um<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> know

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that type of respect but um you know

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
that type of respect but um you know
Washington<00:00:41.160> Nate<00:00:41.489> they<00:00:41.760> had<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> good<00:00:42.120> run<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
Washington Nate they had a good run in

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.319 
Washington Nate they had a good run in
the<00:00:42.570> playoffs<00:00:43.010> similar<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> ours<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.910> think

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the playoffs similar to ours and I think

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
the playoffs similar to ours and I think
winning<00:00:45.570> should<00:00:45.960> determine<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.890> type

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
winning should determine that the type

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.650 
winning should determine that the type
of<00:00:47.129> stuff<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.700> especially<00:00:47.879> if<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:48.510> not

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of stuff you know especially if it's not

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
of stuff you know especially if it's not
an<00:00:49.320> individual<00:00:49.920> player<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.550> should<00:00:50.879> be

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
an individual player it should be

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.170 
an individual player it should be
determined<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:51.809> your<00:00:52.170> team<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
determined by how good your team is so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
determined by how good your team is so
maybe<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.510> need<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:55.079> getting

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
maybe we just need to keep getting

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.959 
maybe we just need to keep getting
better<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> keep<00:00:56.129> trying<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> win<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:56.789> games

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
better and keep trying to win more games

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
enough credit for the system he's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.930 
enough credit for the system he's

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
think he's looking for credit you know

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
think he's looking for credit you know
just<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.190> aren't<00:02:38.400> looking<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.730> credit<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
just like we aren't looking for credit I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.900 
just like we aren't looking for credit I
think<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.630> group<00:02:39.990> effort<00:02:40.430> he<00:02:41.430> gives<00:02:41.700> us

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
think it's a group effort he gives us

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.850 
think it's a group effort he gives us
the<00:02:42.060> system<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.569> run<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.740> our

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the system to run and you know it's our

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.100 
the system to run and you know it's our
job<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.310> out<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.459> executed<00:02:45.180> him<00:02:45.300> put<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
job to go out there executed him put the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.750 
job to go out there executed him put the
time<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.040> comfortable<00:02:47.280> running

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
time in so we can be comfortable running

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
time in so we can be comfortable running
it<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.690> think<00:02:48.720> he<00:02:48.959> does<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> great<00:02:49.290> job<00:02:49.410> with

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it but I think he does a great job with

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.210 
it but I think he does a great job with
us<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.130> people<00:02:50.340> it's<00:02:51.150> hard<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.680> manage<00:02:52.680> egos

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
us as people it's hard to manage egos

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.100 
us as people it's hard to manage egos
and<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.610> don't<00:02:53.700> really<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.180> any<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.750> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and we don't really have any but you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.940 
and we don't really have any but you
know<00:02:55.230> when<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.650> dealing<00:02:55.770> with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
know when you're dealing with

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.910 
know when you're dealing with
professional<00:02:56.550> athletes<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:57.030> tough<00:02:57.920> because

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
professional athletes it's tough because

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920 
professional athletes it's tough because
a<00:02:59.100> lot<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> players<00:02:59.880> have<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.330> much<00:03:00.480> control

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
a lot of players have so much control

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.190 
a lot of players have so much control
and<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.700> know<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.880> have<00:03:03.150> attitudes<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.930> guys

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and you know you have attitudes and guys

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.380 
and you know you have attitudes and guys
making<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:04.920> money<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:06.180> hard<00:03:06.330> to

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
making all this money and it's hard to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.759 
making all this money and it's hard to
control<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.110> think<00:03:07.320> he<00:03:07.380> does<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> great<00:03:07.680> job

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
control but I think he does a great job

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.560 
control but I think he does a great job
gonna<00:03:08.580> say<00:03:08.670> he<00:03:08.850> only<00:03:08.940> locked<00:03:09.120> room<00:03:09.390> you've

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
gonna say he only locked room you've

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.910 
gonna say he only locked room you've
been<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:09.989> you<00:03:10.050> get<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> sense<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.680> it's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
been in but you get the sense that it's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.350 
been in but you get the sense that it's
a<00:03:11.130> kind<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.640> different<00:03:12.030> than<00:03:12.150> maybe<00:03:12.269> some

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
a kind of different than maybe some

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.059 
a kind of different than maybe some
other<00:03:12.570> teams<00:03:12.810> moving<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.440> know<00:03:13.650> for<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> fact

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
other teams moving I know for a fact

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.160 
other teams moving I know for a fact
that<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.610> different<00:03:15.120> just<00:03:15.690> by<00:03:15.840> playing

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
that is different just by playing

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.620 
that is different just by playing
against<00:03:16.440> other<00:03:16.530> teams<00:03:16.830> in<00:03:17.130> how<00:03:18.060> they<00:03:18.209> talk<00:03:18.269> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
against other teams in how they talk to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.270 
against other teams in how they talk to
each<00:03:18.720> other<00:03:18.930> how<00:03:19.170> they<00:03:19.200> respond<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.920> coaches

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
each other how they respond to coaches

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.640 
each other how they respond to coaches
sometimes<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:21.060> know<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.019> our<00:03:22.110> situation<00:03:22.590> is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
sometimes I know that our situation is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.010 
sometimes I know that our situation is
different
