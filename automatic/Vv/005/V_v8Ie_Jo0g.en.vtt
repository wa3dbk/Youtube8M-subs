00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the better it is to use so this is quite

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.530 
the better it is to use so this is quite
a<00:01:25.979> simple<00:01:26.840> Janome<00:01:28.250> average<00:01:29.250> stitching<00:01:29.850> with

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a simple Janome average stitching with

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
using it very very occasionally then
perhaps<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.790> gem<00:02:03.090> platinum<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.409> 7<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.040> 0

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
perhaps a gem platinum like this 7 to 0

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.210 
perhaps a gem platinum like this 7 to 0
and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.409> which<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.770> also

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and then do the one which is also

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.360 
and then do the one which is also
slightly<00:02:08.520> slightly<00:02:09.000> more<00:02:09.619> high-tech<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
slightly slightly more high-tech is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.050 
slightly slightly more high-tech is
the<00:02:11.489> 8:07<00:02:12.300> seven<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.730> by

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the 8:07 seven and this again is by

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.979 
the 8:07 seven and this again is by
Janome<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.250> were<00:02:17.629> these<00:02:18.629> are<00:02:18.780> five<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
Janome so these were these are five of

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.559 
Janome so these were these are five of
the<00:02:19.319> machines<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.709> have<00:02:19.950> got<00:02:20.160> left<00:02:20.569> I'll

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
the machines that have got left I'll

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.540 
the machines that have got left I'll
probably<00:02:21.840> keep<00:02:22.200> hold<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.620> these<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.340> I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
probably keep hold of these because I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
probably keep hold of these because I
hope<00:02:23.849> to<00:02:24.030> continue<00:02:24.330> doing<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.349> sewing

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
hope to continue doing the sewing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.890 
hope to continue doing the sewing

price<00:02:30.480> when<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> paired<00:02:31.230> quite<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> bit<00:02:32.250> now<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
price when I paired quite a bit now the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.059 
price when I paired quite a bit now the
most<00:02:32.819> expensive<00:02:33.299> out<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.989> these<00:02:34.200> machines<00:02:34.620> was

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
most expensive out of these machines was

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.910 
most expensive out of these machines was
the<00:02:36.019> complicated<00:02:37.019> computerized<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the complicated computerized the

embroidery<00:02:38.819> one<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.470> quite

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
embroidery one and I think quite

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.280 
embroidery one and I think quite
remember<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:42.090> I've<00:02:42.269> paid<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.810> these<00:02:42.900> but

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
remember what I've paid for these but

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
remember what I've paid for these but
that<00:02:43.650> was<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.160> most<00:02:44.340> expensive<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:47.480> know

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
that was the most expensive the I know

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.809 
that was the most expensive the I know

machines<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.379> take<00:03:10.379> full<00:03:10.620> one<00:03:10.829> advantage<00:03:11.310> in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
machines is take full one advantage in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.030 
machines is take full one advantage in
the<00:03:11.910> first<00:03:12.150> year<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.690> experiment<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.620> much<00:03:13.860> as

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
the first year and experiment as much as

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.849 
the first year and experiment as much as
you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.459> don't<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.720> buy<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.350> then<00:03:16.590> put

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
you can don't just buy it and then put

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.979 
you can don't just buy it and then put
it<00:03:16.950> away<00:03:17.069> which<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.760> probably<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
it away which is probably one of the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.319 
it away which is probably one of the
problems<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.560> we<00:03:19.859> have<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.940> tend<00:03:21.209> to

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
problems that we have that we tend to

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.210 
problems that we have that we tend to
buy<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.630> stuff<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:22.799> don't<00:03:23.010> actually

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
buy the stuff but then we don't actually

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.539 
buy the stuff but then we don't actually
use<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.750> put<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.049> away<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.709> then<00:03:25.889> we<00:03:26.100> store

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
use it we put it away and then we store

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.490 
use it we put it away and then we store
it<00:03:26.700> away<00:03:26.790> for<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.239> long<00:03:27.269> I'll<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.810> honest<00:03:28.319> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
it away for so long I'll be honest I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.589 
it away for so long I'll be honest I
bought<00:03:28.680> these<00:03:28.920> when<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.639> first<00:03:29.970> did<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.329> sewing

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
bought these when I first did the sewing

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.660 
bought these when I first did the sewing
classes<00:03:30.840> back<00:03:31.349> in<00:03:31.579> 2010<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:33.209> since<00:03:34.160> 2010<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.430> did

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
classes back in 2010 so since 2010 I did

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.520 
classes back in 2010 so since 2010 I did
the<00:03:35.819> classes<00:03:36.239> for<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> first<00:03:36.660> year<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.290> then

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the classes for the first year and then

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.530 
the classes for the first year and then
they've<00:03:37.769> been<00:03:37.859> sitting<00:03:38.220> idle<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.239> don't

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
they've been sitting idle so you don't

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.970 
they've been sitting idle so you don't
want<00:03:39.690> these<00:03:39.810> machines<00:03:40.139> sitting<00:03:40.500> idle<00:03:40.859> you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
want these machines sitting idle you

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.280 
want these machines sitting idle you
want<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.310> use<00:03:41.549> them<00:03:41.819> take<00:03:42.359> advantage<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
want to use them take advantage of the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.920 
want to use them take advantage of the
years<00:03:43.530> guarantee<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.940> know<00:03:45.150> if<00:03:45.389> anything

goes wrong in the first year then

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.000 
goes wrong in the first year then
obviously<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:48.090> will<00:03:48.180> get<00:03:48.419> it<00:03:48.510> replaced<00:03:49.010> I'm

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
obviously you will get it replaced I'm

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.789 
obviously you will get it replaced I'm
not<00:03:50.340> too<00:03:52.040> familiar<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:54.239> usage<00:03:55.169> of<00:03:55.380> these

not too familiar with a usage of these

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.920 
not too familiar with a usage of these
machines<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.730> would<00:03:57.239> not<00:03:57.419> be<00:03:57.630> able<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
machines so I would not be able to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.440 
machines so I would not be able to
advise<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.620> fully<00:03:59.340> because<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> machines

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
advise you fully because the machines

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.129 
advise you fully because the machines
that<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.720> use<00:04:01.230> are<00:04:02.239> these<00:04:03.239> industrial<00:04:03.900> ones

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139
