 galiano irons as his character has evolved over the years 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.180
 but I have to say 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.300
 the evolution that fits a little bit go there 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.900
 at the time 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.510
 make a character a classic hero as he used to 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.990
 then let's talk de 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.780
 which 50 years ago 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 slowly it had to be thankfully I can say adapt grace

 others already know torrent 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.070
 it has a little bit of the times that have changed the many bugs it has kept 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.200
 always 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.580
 its luxury freshness 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.790
 hero simplicity is classic 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 naturally in blowjob environments 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.750
 the tablets of what it was 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.110
 imagined at the beginning 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.109
 we can probably also say that in the ballasted estoril 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.299
 wrong they are. still very current for the issues discussed a few years ago 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.189
 true clash of cultures in this era of migrants no 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 the crops, in short, the temple have rightly changed 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.010
 already it had been a little prepared perhaps for this possibility of change 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:18.229
 in fact it was useful to have imagined it a little bit like this diary 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:24.439
 the initial environment was an imaginary post and was not corresponding to 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.389
 a historical reality this was almost wanted perrone 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.160
 public for my naivety 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.390
 oh for the simplicity from the way of thinking d then but good-natured and ha 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.890
 known news if we want I knew from rally 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.039

 my costume is his way of acting 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:53.699
 allowed him to adapt a little and times that have changed a lot and to 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.169
 tastes also that have changed 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.689

 readers for the pope will write out the Roman herpex stories to the Gratian 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
 what is in your opinion the gem of this yours 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.269
 gem of this volume of ours is precisely this gentleman that I have 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.189
 here beside l 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.399
 galieo stop 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.349
 I find it a forklift 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.380
 close to the character he illustrated for fifty years close 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.550
 propio as essence at the end zagora eh 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.489
 in the sense that 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.659
 de niro ferri and we represent it well I describe it well I have you moreno 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.880
 puppets in the volume 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.129
 and even a man of action is a man 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.379
 of a great soul of great talent tells her the story 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.209
 and with his illustrations he did 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.469
 dream growing up 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.390
 lots and lots of people I find myself so much and maybe 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.529
 what I am now also 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:11.349
 it is what I have also become all the work done also as like 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.579
 songwriter and musician I owe it also thanks to this ability to excite you 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.209
 to dream 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.699
 in what state 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.699
 d the character zag hours drawings of weekdays 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.259
 to provoke this this desire to dream 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.620
 moreno film of a man 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.720
 you play that t-shirt under the jacket a lot 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.499
 pity it was never said that you are looking for zagreb bought 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.340
 because and you must know that dagon only one famous in italy done. the 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:47.860
 longest-lived character after tex but is famous in many countries of the world in 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.580
 especially in the countries of the former Yugoslavia then I found a shop in Zagreb 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.659
 where the befanas of among the many colors sell 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.579
 with lalla lalla lalla sterilized commentator witness echo of 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:03.819
 mezzago popularity worldwide 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.430
 then the gallienos irons 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.439
 his character 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:15.379
 streaming from the point of view for graphic nash in an age in which they went for the 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.699
 older age put US 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.479
 picnik clear the washing machine a little the gordon flash oo al 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.620
 a late but what dvd signature who inspired you the most I think of 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.620
 all poster to barni i gatta alex raymond aron 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.550
 undoubtedly alex raymond 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.669
 above all for the fact that he had is the classicism he had at the bottom 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.930
 so very modest references I and many other senators 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.190
 sleep is the hero to the class cl greek sculptors heroes 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.059
 if you want to see certain attitudes 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.169
 let's say del 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.780
 the sleeps waves alex raymond we review 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.860
 certain attitudes that we find again the same david mica have it 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.139
 then 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.240
 in my small way I mean I looked for metals 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.129
 and with a sign 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.039
 simple precise 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.639
 it is an anatomy even of the classical body there is a little 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.659
 the connection to reality as was possible 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.939
 and within the limits 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:20.440
 respecting what they taught us 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.440
 I don't want the great classics 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:25.539
 exaggerate but 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.180
 loves dissidia 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.400
 of Greek spoltori who managed to give in sculpture 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.509
 the soul made them live the truth so we tried as they tried 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:41.069
 these models of mine we say of designers who have preceded me 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.819
 to say succeed in simplicity 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:45.940
 amanjena detected a reality 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.070
 and to show 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.870
 the movement in the arc is the simplicity of a fast contract
