00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 but it's also more family - a new 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.770
 good gameplay today we are very 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.170
 complicated not because people are being 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.700
 leaving much of the games as 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.549
 always you already know that life is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.250
 cruel but good that I do not rossi your skin 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.500
 And it is 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.970
 what they have I'm going to risk 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 I'm also waiting for that, I'm leaving 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.449
 I go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.869
 the next I do not risk thank you well 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.869
 plate 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.120
 nothing happens nothing happens that's the 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.340
 typical first death so you free yourself a 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.430
 little is not like when when football 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.560
 they take the first yellow and they take you out 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.080
 the hand on the first wither then 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.050
 then you play a bit like I eat 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.460
 fear not but it is not fear is it is shy 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.330
 it's a lie I'm saying 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.530
 it's already taken you please, it's gone another 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.629
 once my cut 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 is making it very difficult to record I'm 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.989
 waiting for the last and station 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.989
 because there must be more people 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.280
 I thought grave 125 the votes are very 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.710
 important I think they are here I do not know 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.939
 it was and I'm already hearing people suddenly 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.939
 care one 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.300
 because I did the tip and look 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.720
 is here 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.710
 and God almost stole it good nothing happens 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.659
 Well, I wanted to tell you that 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.320
 and that I hope you are all well 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.300
 the truth that 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.229
 I'm waiting for the truth that 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.229
 come out something new 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.340
 the times I was going to put in the body 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.020
 noeno in the head 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 but hey it went in the head so no 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.320
 nothing happens 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.930
 the jump does not jump 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.409
 and I think the other one is a boat so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.409
 I hope not 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.820
 although I think that in this game with 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.820
 the frikis bots 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540
 or 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.170
 and she is going to have another 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:21.270
 another eye that you dance to dance him 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.270
 Dancer dances a sauce 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.770
 61 is that they are good games 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.610
 it's very today a game with a lot 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.920
 well there are not so many bots 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.800
 I'm seeing someone 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.360
 lies on equipment 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.370
 and wait, wait, I want you an autograph 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.090
 damn camper is called and his damn 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.090
 converse 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.260
 like the luck and like the line 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.660
 love to jump and return to the site 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.519
 where he was by my side I thought there was 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.519
 one that was here on the right but 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.470
 it's at the bottom we're going to go suddenly to 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.670
 forward god I hate the bots but good 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.150
 what 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.950
 is that I would look for equals but people 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.080
 that puts me to damn quickly 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.200
 rap is that I'm not looking for something else is 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.720
 well life is like that it 's cruel to me the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.540
 life is cruel to me I love the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.860
 I play like there are a lot of people here 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.040
 in Spain who loves the game but 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.180
 is that the search for dera is very bad more than 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.150
 more than I say 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.190
 many people know that with tenerife or ja 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 ja wanted to remove but there was no 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.420
 fucking time bastard that's a body 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.420
 it's mine I'm the name one show 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.720
 no one appears I am what men in the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.720
 house 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.940
 OK 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.420
 I'm seeing clear blue things are the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.420
 hallucinogens 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.870
 well we are seeing a lot the fool here 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.290
 we are missing little time 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.290
 it seems to them 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.930
 in the back and I do not have time to give the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.060
 whatsapp for the reverse for the reverse eye 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.129
 that word is care that we 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.239
 we're going to add it to the real academy 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.239
 extra not the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 he went mex telmex jazz 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:32.630
 look look if you move in a week if 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:34.250
 you are straight and you shoot him to recharge 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.520
 Well, good luck on having 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.009
 luck against bots in the house 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.020
 Regrettably 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.809
 Too bad but good is not it 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.550
 is constantly passing this where 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:49.439
 I get into a game that killed them 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.439
 a couple of times they leave 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.880
 and that's a little bit good there are boats 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.080
 all over the plane can not be anything else 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.080
 more than walking around the map 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.240
 is that I do not encourage 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.400
 wing and I gave him had jumped is a little bit 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.490
 of which he has insurance joined himself 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.560
 he left before he stole it, let's go 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.220
 directly to the last and good was 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.920
 a fairly quick and honest game 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.430
 although it is quite fast 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.290
 good 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.450
 would tax another but it is that there is no one 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.880
 there are few people and there are going to be two bots in 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.860
 a team if yes, someone 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.810
 hoping to play another one but I'm going to 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.400
 try to get out and go back to 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.830
 search until you find some that what 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.510
 better be full and pray to the four 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.270
 gods come out as soon as possible 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.470
 ultimate edition and well we'll see the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.860
 previous but that has liked until 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.860
 then
