00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.839
 when you start blender the first screen that appears that screen that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.239
 checkered it is called three and video 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:12.569
 that is, vision must have 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.459
 alec ahsoak her 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.409
 How do you have some elements? 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.850
 among them an object of the scene 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.730
 that is, the one that was later manipulated into something 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.849
 Can you imagine a little doll? 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.759
 koke and he indicated to me that who has in his head so what can transform 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.780
 these elements that neither previously would not sell 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.370
 is an end and also that at the end of a lamp this is the symbol 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.940
 that refers you have a lamp that will illuminate this object at the moment 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.200
 that is 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 to finish objective I could see it here 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 to the lamp function 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.590
 here I have been to the event either 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.900
 so we have the singer that she focuses on is looking at this object at 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300
 from this angle 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.440
 that is to say practically since this is not 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.810
 will also see how the camera works I'll explain 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.330
 in detail 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.060
 here we have three elements being 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.600
 both the lamp 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.470
 other the river chamber- main element that is the object 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.680
 but let's talk a lot about objects 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.230
 Neither for you know how what transforms the object 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.329
 these may note here has a certain directional boils 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.970
 to move the object when you select 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 certain it causes you to have to move 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.500
 and this if you touch 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.570
 Clickable lamp opt for the lamp it can do the same thing moved 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 lamp 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580
 because 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.689
 and the same can do with a camera 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.390
 However, the concerts that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.090
 or in the movement 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.530
 the dafne elements 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.640
 very well 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.510
 this stage, which is called 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.830
 keycorp did not even have 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.579
 in a scene of a movie is or is not 7 of filming 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:11.879
 it's good 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.260
 but elements that appear on the screen 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.159
 in the top menu 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.149
 1- central here normally 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:24.219
 in the bottom menu, right away the blender shows fruit and six minutes here 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.219
 you opt for some commands right away 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:34.009
 know the blender screen here it can be totally modified and put 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:38.609
 titled menorquin add new menus split this screen into two 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.609
 he'll have to offer things done later I'll show him how he does it 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.499
 This is where we're going to have to start from the basics and know a little bit 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.529
 on the screen 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.290
 and stay morgan stanley 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.340
 Yes, and this is what the vision that you want to have here 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.419
 to work 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.579
 this is called vision 3 bi or obvious crisis another idea and saw that comes or 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.699
 click here 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.399
 the symbol of love called 'the criterion 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.839
 this one from here when I click here on tv and above her and 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.379
 window of buttons translating portuguese 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.379
 here in cinema and fifi 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.729
 user preferences 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.869
 these - you 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:28.449
 the sus has effects on the ribs things are related to that screen here 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.359
 it is related to a lower index than the 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:32.340
 the 3d 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.339
 ok 3d vision 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:38.869
 very well they will work a little on this screen and we will learn a little like that 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.739
 move objects how does this move why 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.029
 Before I say it, I'll go 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.030
 caresse object for another 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.320
 how much to select an object 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.299
 is not currently selected 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.219
 you have to right-click on it 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.489
 and then it has that body outline indicating that you have selected 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.759
 The selector tool wants to delete it now if you press the delete key on your 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:07.699
 keyboard 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.749
 and appears half-naked and simply eliminates 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.520
 I want to put another object that is easier for us to understand 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.520
 like that blender works so I'll put it here 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.360
 another object to put the object made technical visit 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.639
 space-bar 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.930
 you choose 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.210
 one of your options in case I want 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.840
 the connection 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.219
 and this month and will keep 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.409
 It is one of 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.809
 objects pattern that comes in the blend state but what will be easier to 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:40.650
 understand 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.150
 very well pointed out that the jets already come with some selection in mrs psd os 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
 penguins of the brand they version summed 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.659
 of the object 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:58.020
 these deficits they appear because it was automatically changed from the screen 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.810
 division or by the beam and saw it changed the condition of the object of 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.089
 Speck object for television 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.599
 or editing mode 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.889
 it is different thing between the two is that it is here that he enters and makes movements 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.879
 club hostage 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.020
 mechelen object's details 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.800
 this is another you say details of the object is can move in every bit 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.559
 of him to change things in him then they prefer this way didi 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.060
 standards will speak about these two in the chest shortly 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.919
 I'm going back to the way the object made a hat-trick 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.889
 f by widening the seraphim a little that sinks monkey, right? 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.599
 is one of the 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 doha of the standard minds 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.580
 Dodo did not even give time. 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.110
 no tipnis 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.180
 I'm looking at object 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.749
 for the little monkey 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:01.490
 This is what the so-called suzane suzano the petrochemical name of the monkey that in the 

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:02.389
 planet 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.139
 the prizes here her name 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.129
 you 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.919
 is looking suzano by the vision 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:10.879
 front 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.330
 How do you say if you see here? 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.639
 in the thousand option 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.309
 I'm already manipulating the knife. 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:19.550
 saw 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.850
 you will see that this cheer to the front ie the frontal view 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.020
 of the suzane 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.469
 looking at her from the front 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.370
 I suppose you want to see people there? 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.680
 pilot 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.770
 look that 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.300
 see her 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.629
 fiscal council of 1 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.509
 helicopters and ana sousa 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.139
 the ships will stop 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.939
 side the parents that he is next to 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:41.830
 look that 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.210
 suzane being looked at 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.710
 which has the so-called vision of 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.960
 had a vision 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.919
 kedar the sharp 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.980
 clarity that this here is a 3d environment 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.050
 walking I believe there is a 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.210
 square is an ample place 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.469
 It happens that the planet there with its little head parked on the ground ok 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.710
 I'm in this environment that happened kind of circulates all over it 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.819
 depending on how you want to move 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:14.860
 Let's learn some like I told you. 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.099
 without knowing how to move 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.029
 the object
