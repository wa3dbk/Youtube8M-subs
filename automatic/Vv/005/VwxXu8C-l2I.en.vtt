00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello my name is Hase me well and I prepare today if you have a Rhenish 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.919
 Sauerbraten too 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.509
 I have the meat two days ago 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.449
 the red wines 80 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.539
 marinated 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.730
 furthermore there are allspice grain eaters in there 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.730
 Tracker down to our customers a genuine one 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.589
 the problem to the market for the sauce 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 which is the heart of the institute 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 so the meat falls dry 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 and is it time 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.330
 then it comes into the distance 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
 and is attached there 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.410
 where the vegetables I've heard now are still seared 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.690
 the one from the archive 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 for this here suddenly 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.560
 then the meat becomes 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.560
 taken back again 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.050
 and have to go there 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.320
 with the lid closed, stew for two hours at low heat 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.540
 that was it done now 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.830
 and I can do it Dr 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
 to become of it 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 the sauce passively many by a 7 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.890
 and we give now 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.170
 to that was Cerny approx 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 for the bond 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.330
 old 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.140
 the roses 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 March has to cook for another two minutes 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.270
 then this day has 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 At first, maybe it is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 and 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.099
 for the sauce 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.769
 I want you to enjoy cooking and a good appetite
