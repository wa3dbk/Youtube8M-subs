00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
plenty of money in turn which is better

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.929 
plenty of money in turn which is better
for<00:01:07.060> all-around<00:01:07.360> riding<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> lot<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.729> people

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
truck it seems not as popular and I

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.730 
truck it seems not as popular and I
would<00:01:18.850> say<00:01:18.999> for<00:01:19.240> most<00:01:19.359> riding<00:01:19.929> for<00:01:20.590> higher

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
would say for most riding for higher

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.560 
would say for most riding for higher
speed<00:01:21.039> riding<00:01:21.249> and<00:01:21.520> free<00:01:21.700> rides

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
180 is sort of the go-to but with a lot

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:30.239

when<00:01:30.490> you're<00:01:30.609> running<00:01:30.729> offset<00:01:31.299> wheels<00:01:31.659> it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
when you're running offset wheels it

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.590 
when you're running offset wheels it
ends<00:01:32.649> up<00:01:32.710> being<00:01:33.009> about<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.579> same<00:01:33.789> width<00:01:34.240> this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
ends up being about the same width this

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.630 
ends up being about the same width this
if<00:01:34.990> you're<00:01:35.259> running<00:01:35.409> 180s<00:01:36.009> with<00:01:36.130> center<00:01:36.399> set

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
if you're running 180s with center set

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.169 
if you're running 180s with center set
wheels<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.630> this<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:39.039> feels<00:01:39.340> pretty<00:01:39.609> natural

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
wheels so this it feels pretty natural

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.879 
wheels so this it feels pretty natural
even<00:01:40.420> on<00:01:40.509> like<00:01:40.689> 10<00:01:40.929> inch<00:01:41.079> boards<00:01:41.499> and<00:01:41.770> stuff

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
even on like 10 inch boards and stuff

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.770 
even on like 10 inch boards and stuff
like<00:01:42.069> that<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.789> get<00:01:42.909> more<00:01:43.060> grip<00:01:43.359> with<00:01:43.689> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
like that you get more grip with the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.660 
like that you get more grip with the
skinnier<00:01:44.170> truck<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.859> just<00:01:44.889> quicker<00:01:45.369> turn

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
skinnier truck and just quicker turn

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.069 
skinnier truck and just quicker turn
which<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:45.969> better<00:01:46.119> for<00:01:46.299> staying<00:01:46.569> there<00:01:46.780> Todd

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
which is better for staying there Todd

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.090
