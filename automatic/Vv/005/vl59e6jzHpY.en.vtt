00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.670
 back with magazine from the field one 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.610
 production with a certain destination in Europe 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.380
 farm in bauru in the state of são paulo 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:26.890
 exports 90% of avocado production 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.230
 are produced at least 600 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.869
 tons of fruit per month 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 two varieties different from Mexican 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.430
 strong and American companies cover a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 542 hectares 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.900
 the lawyer arrived in 1975 in this 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.810
 property 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.720
 in the beginning were 70 hectares of the strong type 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.720
 mexico and avocado from the ras 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.950
 california the deal was so certain that 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.830
 Today there are only 542 hectares of 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.730
 a productivity of 18 tonnes per 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.100
 hectare 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.080
 the plant requires water 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 especially during the flowering season and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.850
 This is important for us to make a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.189
 automated control even for the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.289
 regulate the amount of water and there 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.780
 waste this sensor is the tensiometer 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.640
 and on top of that tensiometer we 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.859
 can assess if there really is 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.319
 whether or not the need for irrigation is 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.899
 incubation system is done through 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.749
 a program based on the analysis 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.539
 soil chemistry and leaf analysis in 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.999
 Above this work is done a 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.249
 assessment to find out what will be the 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.530
 requirements that the plant needs both 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.020
 fertilizer and organic fertilizer in the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.810
 harvest that goes until October the labor force 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.880
 come from the penitentiary in addition to receiving 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.729
 a salary every three working days 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.060
 re-educating eliminates one day's worth 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.459
 help is not getting any better 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.549
 our pity understood in helping us family 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.829
 on the outside and help is not also to keep the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.829
 day by day everything under the attentive eyes of 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.859
 since no fruit can 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:08.649
 on foot and and eye lion alive he met 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.050
 on the downside you have to look 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.450
 they speak fiscal fruit even the wallet one 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.939
 resistant tree but suffers from 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.269
 the incidence of some pests more 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:21.190
 caterpillars and 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.520
 fungi that harms 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.540
 the root of the plant in the control case is 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.540
 of the caterpillar is a lizard in a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.160
 very high and economical damage with respect to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.110
 Grandfather Cadu due to the amount of 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 leaves of the aerial part that the plant has 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.690
 but it is a cat she is monitored so that 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.000
 we can know if it really exists 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.580
 the possibility of making a control or 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.920
 not with respect to that name which is a 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.830
 of the key pests that can 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.680
 harm is directly the result we 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.430
 monitors this through this external 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.950
 traps 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.080
 business is going so well that it's only 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.100
 installed inside the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.720
 farm packs 150 tons of avocado 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.080
 per week 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.570
 ninety percent of the fruit passing through 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.570
 here goes to the European market 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.940
 we started with my father with an idea of 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.650
 oil extraction failed to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.860
 oil extraction began to work with 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.830
 the export of this fruit and since then the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.410
 our main export focus since 97 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.600
 we put on the national market and that comes 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.310
 growing well because Brazil is one of the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.130
 Just a curiosity, but Brazil is a 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.820
 of countries with an avocado in general as 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.739
 candy 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.730
 the rest of the world as a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.130
 variety they consume the salted fruit 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.640
 in pâtés shall summon him to a 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.950
 pasta dish with meat with fish and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.930
 so we are from the moment 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.820
 We started putting avocado here. 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.739
 in Brazil there is also work with 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.920
 salty recipes in this fruit 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.470
 we have today the avocado the site of bauru 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.280
 and going to london will have a rest 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:09.070
 On the way back to France, you 'll 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.450
 lawyers are also prosecuted and 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.720
 frozen for restaurants 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.550
 specialized 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.310
 this test is for the consumption of 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.549
 Ice cream for restaurants, right? 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.190
 in general we do so stopped hollow 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.620
 mole which is a mexican food bar a 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.860
 installation of the factory on the farm 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.110
 improved the local economy, so 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.770
 workers are happy with the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.139
 Function 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.949
 I love working 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.439
 for three years working here I just 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.479
 selects the small weight and the large 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:46.789
 sent back to the new selection 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.789
 and from here I do not go out three more selection in
