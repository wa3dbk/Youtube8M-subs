starting off switch to classic mode so
we<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> geometry<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.529> we're

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we can see the geometry that we're

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.400 
we can see the geometry that we're
running<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.070> hop<00:00:26.730> along<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.050> crevice

our<00:01:14.010> rocket<00:01:14.369> launcher<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:15.030> should<00:01:15.240> hit<00:01:15.360> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
our rocket launcher we should hit a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
our rocket launcher we should hit a
checkpoint<00:01:15.689> somewhere<00:01:16.350> around<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.009> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
checkpoint somewhere around here so you

this<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.590> allow<00:01:19.860> newbies<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> practice

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
this will allow newbies to practice

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
this will allow newbies to practice
their<00:01:21.509> ghost<00:01:21.750> launch<00:01:22.020> over<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:22.890> and

their ghost launch over and over and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
their ghost launch over and over and
over<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:24.000> hard<00:01:24.299> trick

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
over because this is a pretty hard trick

over because this is a pretty hard trick
to<00:01:24.659> pull<00:01:24.810> off<00:01:24.990> I'll<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.770> my<00:01:25.950> best<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.369> explain

to pull off I'll do my best to explain

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.600 
to pull off I'll do my best to explain
exactly<00:01:26.909> how<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:29.340> we're<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
exactly how I do it now we're going to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.850 
exactly how I do it now we're going to
drop<00:01:29.850> down<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> rocket<00:01:31.560> launcher

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
drop down here I use the rocket launcher

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
drop down here I use the rocket launcher
to<00:01:31.920> shoot<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> turret<00:01:32.970> off<00:01:33.150> first<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> then

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
to shoot the turret off first and then

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
to shoot the turret off first and then
to<00:01:34.710> shoot<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> elite

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
to shoot this go so that the elite

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
to shoot this go so that the elite
doesn't<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> normally<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.290> flips<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
doesn't get in it normally it flips now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
doesn't get in it normally it flips now
here<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:39.119> specific<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.840> ghost<00:01:40.140> huh

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
here this is very specific the ghost huh

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
here this is very specific the ghost huh
the<00:01:40.680> left<00:01:40.920> wing<00:01:41.159> hugs<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> grey<00:01:41.970> space<00:01:42.299> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the left wing hugs this grey space the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
the left wing hugs this grey space the
right<00:01:42.990> wing<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.380> lined<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.829> with<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> right

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
right wing is lined up with the right

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
right wing is lined up with the right
tip<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> concave<00:01:45.299> angle<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.290> we're

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
tip on that concave angle and then we're

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.870 
tip on that concave angle and then we're
aiming<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.979> ghost<00:01:47.189> towards<00:01:47.490> where<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.670> throw

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
aiming the ghost towards where we throw

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
aiming the ghost towards where we throw
that<00:01:48.030> grenade<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.259> look<00:01:49.590> at<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that grenade and then we look at that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
that grenade and then we look at that
specific<00:01:50.610> point<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> grey<00:01:51.689> triangle

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
specific point where the grey triangle

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
specific point where the grey triangle
meets<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> green<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> Left<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:54.119> throw<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
meets the green on the Left we throw the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
meets the green on the Left we throw the
grenade<00:01:54.899> immediately<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> ghost<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
grenade immediately get in the ghost and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.990 
grenade immediately get in the ghost and
then<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.750> go<00:01:58.439> forwards<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> slight

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
then we go forwards and then a slight

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
then we go forwards and then a slight
right<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> back<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.409> ghost<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
right so that the back of the ghost is

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
right so that the back of the ghost is
right<00:02:02.250> above<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.880> frag<00:02:03.119> grenade<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
right above the frag grenade when it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.170 
right above the frag grenade when it
goes<00:02:03.840> off<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.670> part<00:02:05.909> down

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
goes off and if you get this part down

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
goes off and if you get this part down
it's<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.810> consistent<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.590> hit<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.740> like

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it's very consistent you can hit it like

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.550 
it's very consistent you can hit it like
9<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.369> 10<00:02:08.640> times<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.810> very<00:02:10.259> tricky

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
9 out of 10 times but it is very tricky

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
9 out of 10 times but it is very tricky
to<00:02:10.739> pull<00:02:10.920> off<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.250> first<00:02:11.489> time<00:02:11.700> you're<00:02:11.940> doing

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
to pull off the first time you're doing

to pull off the first time you're doing
it<00:02:12.270> here<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.959> want<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> drop<00:02:13.379> down

little easier you don't have to do that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.450 
little easier you don't have to do that
you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.080> also<00:02:55.230> just<00:02:55.500> try<00:02:55.620> driving<00:02:56.070> into<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
you can also just try driving into the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.760 
you can also just try driving into the
wall<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.880> will<00:02:56.940> eventually<00:02:57.390> work<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.350> here

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
wall and it will eventually work so here

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.070 
wall and it will eventually work so here
we're<00:02:58.920> gonna<00:02:59.010> go<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.210> between<00:03:00.660> these<00:03:00.870> two

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
we're gonna go in between these two

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.110 
we're gonna go in between these two
little<00:03:01.350> parallel<00:03:01.770> green<00:03:02.220> bushes<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.970> then

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
little parallel green bushes and then

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.060 
little parallel green bushes and then
here<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.690> another<00:03:03.780> two<00:03:04.170> parallel<00:03:04.680> bushes

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
here you see another two parallel bushes

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.130 
here you see another two parallel bushes
and<00:03:05.220> I'm<00:03:05.280> sort<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.520> going<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.850> between<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.600> now

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
and I'm sort of going in between and now

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.840 
and I'm sort of going in between and now
this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.770> hardest<00:03:08.220> part<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.700> don't

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
this is the hardest part is you don't

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.030 
this is the hardest part is you don't
want<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> drop<00:03:09.210> down<00:03:09.450> here<00:03:09.690> too<00:03:09.960> fast<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
want to drop down here too fast and you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.410 
want to drop down here too fast and you
don't<00:03:11.070> want<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.430> hit<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:11.970> wall<00:03:12.240> you

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
don't want to hit the right wall you

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.790 
don't want to hit the right wall you
want<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.660> drop<00:03:12.870> either<00:03:13.110> onto<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.560> white

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
want to drop either onto the white

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.160 
want to drop either onto the white
section<00:03:14.070> or<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.970> lesser<00:03:15.510> sloped<00:03:15.840> green

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
section now here we want to aim for the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.280 
section now here we want to aim for the
middle<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.370> segment<00:03:21.090> right<00:03:21.330> here<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.870> do

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
middle of this segment right here I do

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.350 
middle of this segment right here I do
sort<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.860> half<00:03:23.070> boost<00:03:23.400> as<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.670> boost<00:03:23.940> off<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
sort of a half boost as I boost off the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.970 
sort of a half boost as I boost off the
cliff<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.990> stop<00:03:25.290> boosting<00:03:25.770> so<00:03:25.950> I

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
cliff and then I stop boosting so I

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.370 
cliff and then I stop boosting so I
don't<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.280> flying<00:03:26.730> off<00:03:26.970> into<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> forest<00:03:27.600> now

don't go flying off into the forest now

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.620 
don't go flying off into the forest now
by<00:03:28.530> coming<00:03:28.890> down<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> wall<00:03:29.490> here<00:03:29.880> we<00:03:30.330> make

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
by coming down on the wall here we make

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.300 
by coming down on the wall here we make
the<00:03:30.840> game<00:03:30.990> think<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.560> we're<00:03:31.680> actually<00:03:31.860> in

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the game think that we're actually in

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.580 
the game think that we're actually in
the<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.940> jackal<00:03:33.630> sniper<00:03:33.930> forest<00:03:34.410> which<00:03:34.560> is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the the jackal sniper forest which is

the the jackal sniper forest which is
one<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.070> most<00:03:35.220> nightmarish<00:03:35.640> segments<00:03:36.420> in

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
one of the most nightmarish segments in

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.510 
one of the most nightmarish segments in
the<00:03:36.570> entire<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.320> by<00:03:37.830> doing<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.490> can

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
the entire game and by doing that we can

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.490 
the entire game and by doing that we can
come<00:03:38.820> back<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.360> wall<00:03:39.570> hit<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.140> next

come back up the wall hit the next
loading<00:03:40.860> zone<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.850> completely<00:03:42.510> skipped

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
loading zone and we completely skipped
