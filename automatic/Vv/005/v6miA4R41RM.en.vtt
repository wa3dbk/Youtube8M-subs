this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.709> the<00:00:02.060> portable

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
this is a video of the portable

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.099 
this is a video of the portable
generator<00:00:03.810> house<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.040> saw<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:06.359> lot<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
generator house that I saw in a lot of

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.379 
generator house that I saw in a lot of
hardware<00:00:07.470> stores<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.280> decided<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.910> make

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
hardware stores and I decided to make

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.490 
hardware stores and I decided to make
one<00:00:09.420> myself<00:00:09.950> this<00:00:10.950> particular<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.300> about

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
one myself this particular one was about

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
one myself this particular one was about
$450<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.620> saw<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.820> built<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.210> probably<00:00:15.839> for

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
$450 I saw and I built it probably for

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.820 
$450 I saw and I built it probably for
about<00:00:16.730> 300<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.029> bit<00:00:18.150> more<00:00:18.619> with<00:00:19.619> all<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
about 300 a little bit more with all the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.830 
about 300 a little bit more with all the
extra<00:00:20.460> bells<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.789> whistles<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.539> put<00:00:21.810> on

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
extra bells and whistles that I put on

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.750 
extra bells and whistles that I put on
it<00:00:22.699> including<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.230> vents<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.740> exhausts<00:00:26.580> and

it including the vents the exhausts and
so<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.330> forth<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:30.560> 45

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so on and so forth this is about 45

inches by about 35 inches something like
that<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.760> exactly<00:00:35.850> sure<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.739> made<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.070> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that not exactly sure I made this so you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.680 
that not exactly sure I made this so you
can<00:00:38.340> obviously<00:00:38.940> as<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.390> fully

I<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.879> merely<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.920> protect<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I just merely did this to protect the

I just merely did this to protect the
generator<00:00:53.730> while<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.149> outside<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
generator while it's outside this is a

generator while it's outside this is a
rigid<00:00:56.280> 8000<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> bought<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.539> Home<00:00:57.719> Depot<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
rigid 8000 I bought from Home Depot the

rigid 8000 I bought from Home Depot the
upper<00:00:59.969> top<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.840> ventilation<00:01:01.829> fan<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
upper top there is a ventilation fan I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
upper top there is a ventilation fan I
have<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.210> 16<00:01:03.719> inch<00:01:03.750> panels<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.220> cross

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
have two 16 inch panels of for cross

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.870 
have two 16 inch panels of for cross
ventilation<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.619> also<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.950> converted<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
ventilation and also I converted this a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.170 
ventilation and also I converted this a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.899 

I<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.619> hooked<00:01:27.860> up<00:01:28.130> sorry<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:28.850> the

I have that hooked up sorry for the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.850 
I have that hooked up sorry for the
train<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.020> hooked<00:01:30.259> up<00:01:30.440> in<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.650> back

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
train I have that hooked up in the back

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.760 
train I have that hooked up in the back
and<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.610> goes<00:01:31.820> out<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.420> back<00:01:32.690> for<00:01:33.470> a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
and then that goes out to the back for a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.050 
and then that goes out to the back for a
natural<00:01:34.490> gas<00:01:34.820> line<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:37.040> have<00:01:37.190> running

exhaust<00:01:48.290> vent<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.220> hooked<00:01:49.399> right<00:01:49.580> up<00:01:49.729> to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
exhaust vent that it hooked right up to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.600 
exhaust vent that it hooked right up to
the<00:01:52.660> generator<00:01:53.660> itself<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.770> plug<00:01:55.100> would<00:01:55.369> run

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
the generator itself the plug would run

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.460 
the generator itself the plug would run
all<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.179> way<00:01:56.270> down<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.170> put<00:01:57.470> a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
all the way down I just put a

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.570 
all the way down I just put a
weatherproofing<00:02:00.470> plug<00:02:00.800> there's<00:02:01.070> just<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.369> hole

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
weatherproofing plug there's just a hole

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.219 
weatherproofing plug there's just a hole
back<00:02:01.940> there<00:02:02.240> there's<00:02:02.509> nothing<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.990> there

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
back there there's nothing in there

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.080 
back there there's nothing in there
except<00:02:03.619> just<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:04.369> know<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.670> run<00:02:04.820> it<00:02:04.940> through

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
except just you know just run it through

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.440 
except just you know just run it through
and<00:02:05.420> then<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.990> would<00:02:06.289> go<00:02:06.500> over<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:08.149> box

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and then that would go over to the box

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.199 
and then that would go over to the box
over<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:08.869> 30<00:02:09.170> amp<00:02:09.410> box<00:02:09.700> that's<00:02:10.700> plugged<00:02:11.030> in

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
over there 30 amp box that's plugged in

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.570 
over there 30 amp box that's plugged in
with<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.450> interlock<00:02:11.870> system<00:02:12.380> there's<00:02:13.280> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
with the interlock system there's the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.740 
with the interlock system there's the
fan<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.250> forth

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.410 

it's<00:02:19.200> easily<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:20.460> real<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> biggest

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it's easily the real and the biggest

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's easily the real and the biggest
reason<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:21.990> did<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:24.200> because<00:02:25.200> my

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
reason I did this is because my

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.940 
reason I did this is because my
generator<00:02:26.570> was<00:02:27.570> all<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.990> way<00:02:28.080> down<00:02:28.410> there<00:02:28.650> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
generator was all the way down there and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.830 
generator was all the way down there and
if<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.130> needed<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.820> had<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> drag<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.570> all<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
if I needed it I had to drag it all the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.020 
if I needed it I had to drag it all the
way<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.190> said<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.430> didn't<00:02:32.910> do

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
way up here so like I said I didn't do

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.730 
way up here so like I said I didn't do
this<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.240> soundproofing<00:02:34.050> reasons<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.530> just

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
this for soundproofing reasons I just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.199 
this for soundproofing reasons I just
did<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:34.980> convenience<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> myself<00:02:38.209> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
did it for convenience of myself to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.770 
did it for convenience of myself to
start<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.290> up<00:02:40.500> now<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.070> would<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:42.450> come

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
start this up now all I would do is come

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:53.050 
start this up now all I would do is come
in<00:02:43.400> turn<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.820> propane<00:02:49.730> prime<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
in turn on the propane prime the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.979 
in turn on the propane prime the
generator<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.560> couple<00:02:55.560> seconds<00:02:56.600> turn<00:02:57.600> on<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
generator a couple seconds turn on the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:55.100 
generator a couple seconds turn on the
key

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:20.240 

like<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.770> said<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.160> not<00:03:56.310> much<00:03:56.520> less<00:03:57.090> toys

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.900 

there<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.370> have<00:04:21.579> it

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
there you have it

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.900 
there you have it
what<00:04:22.419> about<00:04:22.570> it
