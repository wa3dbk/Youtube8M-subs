cars and and they're insane and to make
one<00:00:11.130> run<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.519> car<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> nice

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
one run in this car is about a nice

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.180 
one run in this car is about a nice
clean<00:00:13.259> round<00:00:13.410> somewhere<00:00:13.769> between<00:00:13.889> ten<00:00:14.160> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
clean round somewhere between ten and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.589 
clean round somewhere between ten and
twelve<00:00:14.490> thousand<00:00:14.849> dollars<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.210> mean<00:00:15.330> I've<00:00:15.450> seen

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
twelve thousand dollars I mean I've seen

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.810 
twelve thousand dollars I mean I've seen
like<00:00:15.839> videos<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.619> looks<00:00:17.039> violently<00:00:17.550> leave

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
like videos and it looks violently leave

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.490 
like videos and it looks violently leave
the<00:00:17.970> starting<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> course<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.779> zero<00:00:19.080> yeah

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the starting on the course at zero yeah

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
the starting on the course at zero yeah
and<00:00:19.800> then<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.160> 60-foot<00:00:20.640> timer<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and then we have a 60-foot timer and

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.400 
and then we have a 60-foot timer and
that's<00:00:21.240> 60<00:00:21.600> feet<00:00:21.840> we're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.199> hundred

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that's 60 feet we're going a hundred

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.349 
that's 60 feet we're going a hundred
miles<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:22.949> hour<00:00:23.130> all<00:00:23.189> ready<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:24.000> leave<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
miles an hour all ready to leave the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.720 
miles an hour all ready to leave the
force<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.039> employs<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.250> our<00:00:26.369> bodies

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
force that it employs in our bodies

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.120 
force that it employs in our bodies
three<00:00:27.240> g's<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.019> then<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.650> 60<00:00:28.980> feet

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
three g's so then it that's what 60 feet

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
three g's so then it that's what 60 feet
100<00:00:29.550> miles<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.760> hour<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> then<00:00:30.179> at<00:00:30.300> 330<00:00:30.900> feet

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
100 miles an hour and then at 330 feet

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.770 
100 miles an hour and then at 330 feet
we're<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.769> about<00:00:31.920> 270<00:00:32.910> miles<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.660> make

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
we're going about 270 miles now to make

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.080 
we're going about 270 miles now to make
a<00:00:33.809> successful<00:00:34.290> fast<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
a successful fast and that the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
a successful fast and that the
transformation<00:00:36.690> between<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> 3GS

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
transformation between the 3GS

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.680 
transformation between the 3GS
and<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.219> 270<00:00:38.760> miles<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.000> hour<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> total<00:00:39.629> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and the 270 miles an hour is a total of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
and the 270 miles an hour is a total of
about<00:00:39.780> 8<00:00:40.079> G's<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.590> total<00:00:40.920> oh<00:00:41.040> yeah<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:42.180> much

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
about 8 G's in total oh yeah how much

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
about 8 G's in total oh yeah how much
horsepower<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.320> well<00:00:43.590> actually<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
horsepower is it that well actually you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.619 
horsepower is it that well actually you
know<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.789> looks<00:00:44.820> fairly<00:00:45.210> Lawrence<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
know what it looks fairly Lawrence is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.029 
know what it looks fairly Lawrence is

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
hundred and five gallon that pump and s
just<00:01:06.840> puts<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> same<00:01:07.650> volume<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> fire

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
just puts up the same volume that a fire

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
just puts up the same volume that a fire
water<00:01:08.850> truck<00:01:09.150> yeah<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.659> puts<00:01:09.810> out<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.049> 100

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.080 
gallons this fuel pump does the same
issue

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
issue

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810 
issue
oh<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.600> fills<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> motor<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:14.189> seconds<00:01:14.700> with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
oh it fills this motor for seconds with

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
oh it fills this motor for seconds with
that<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.150> fuel<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> leave<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that much fuel so how do you leave the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.649 
that much fuel so how do you leave the
line<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> trans<00:01:17.939> brake<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> bio

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
line is it like a trans brake in a bio

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.969 
line is it like a trans brake in a bio
no<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:19.110> no<00:01:19.229> I'll<00:01:19.439> show<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.950> done

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
no no no I'll show you how it's done

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.980 
no no no I'll show you how it's done
here<00:01:20.280> yeah<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> way<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.479> works<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
here yeah the way the way this works is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.020 
here yeah the way the way this works is
of<00:01:22.229> course<00:01:22.470> you've<00:01:23.070> seen<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.670> burnouts

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
of course you've seen we do burnouts

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
of course you've seen we do burnouts
yeah<00:01:24.390> yeah<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.110> during<00:01:25.350> burnouts<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
yeah yeah so we do during burnouts to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.850 
yeah yeah so we do during burnouts to
clean<00:01:26.040> cars<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> keep

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
clean cars and keep

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.070 
clean cars and keep
more<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:27.730> put<00:01:27.970> rubber<00:01:28.210> down<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.600> racetrack
