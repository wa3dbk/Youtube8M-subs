00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
planet legend and the demon would

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
planet legend and the demon would

eventually try sending Clarion back home
but<00:00:58.379> he<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.649> never<00:00:58.859> able<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> fully<00:00:59.820> succeed

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
but he was never able to fully succeed

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
but he was never able to fully succeed
because<00:01:00.690> Clarion<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.280> at

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
because Clarion was just that good at

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
because Clarion was just that good at
magic<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.449> over<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> years<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> them

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
magic so over the years the two of them

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.250 
magic so over the years the two of them
would<00:01:04.739> form<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.129> rivalry<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.000> rivalry<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
would form a rivalry a rivalry which I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.130 
would form a rivalry a rivalry which I
would<00:01:07.409> like<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.950> eventually<00:01:08.340> revived
