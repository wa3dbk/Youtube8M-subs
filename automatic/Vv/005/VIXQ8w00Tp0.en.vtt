00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.200
 Hello 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 Today I would like to show you how 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.600
 you can quickly become a very simple one 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.760
 prepared buttercream and then too 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.170
 still suitable from then is the following 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.980
 we need ingredients for it 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.470
 and once 500 grams beloved 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.559
 powdered sugar then four teaspoons 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:38.730
 lemon juice 2 tablespoons hot water 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 and 250 grams of very soft butter and that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.219
 that's it then we come to the preparation so 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.350
 First of all, I have the 250 here 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 grated butter and the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 offers frothy whipped up 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.480
 then we'll see each other again like it 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.480
 continues 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.320
 So now I have the machine 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.170
 briefly identified as the mother it comes 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.690
 her as far as foamy beaten that she 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 then understand me you can tell 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.140
 I now where the machine is off we are 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.880
 now go piece by piece for the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 machine immediately again runs powdered sugar 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.040
 and leave something all the time now 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 first stir and next time 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.810
 step then we see each other again 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.490
 so that powdered sugar sometimes sit 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.360
 agitated form now we only give 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.330
 the four teaspoons of lemon juice with it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.780
 and leave two tablespoons of hot water 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.280
 mix it up again and then let it go 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.720
 your kitchen machine just so long 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.310
 run until the butter cream you very much 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.490
 white appears and then it is exactly 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.490
 right 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.500
 that's what it should look like 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.990
 So that's already enough for me 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.320
 and I will be here right now 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.150
 in a bowl and then do that 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.360
 brush the next pie 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.090
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.890
 and it's ratzfatz done and you have 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.060
 then always a nice foundation for yours 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.160
 Then fondant on today on it to make 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.810
 and just try it out and if 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.310

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.680
