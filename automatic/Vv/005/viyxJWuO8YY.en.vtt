00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this a series i guess i could say i'm

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
this a series i guess i could say i'm
not<00:00:35.700> sure<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.000> many<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.270> these<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
not sure how many of these are going to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.180 
not sure how many of these are going to
be<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.020> I've<00:00:37.320> tried<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> awkward

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
be because I've tried all the awkward

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.299 
be because I've tried all the awkward
combinations<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> weapons<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.300> stuff<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
combinations of weapons and stuff and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
combinations of weapons and stuff and
it's<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.579> been<00:00:41.730> terrible<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it's just been terrible and this the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's just been terrible and this the
only<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:43.980> worked<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.640> me

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
only one that actually worked out for me

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
only one that actually worked out for me
the<00:00:44.820> first<00:00:44.969> time<00:00:45.090> I've<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.420> done<00:00:45.660> decent

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the first time I've actually done decent

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.920 
the first time I've actually done decent
with<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.860> setup<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.690> normally<00:00:48.690> like

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
with this setup because normally like

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.299 
with this setup because normally like
when<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.110> using<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.500> example<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.950> always<00:00:50.190> i

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
when I was using for example I always i

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
when I was using for example I always i
love<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> use<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.789> example<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.539> stoner

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
love to use this example but the stoner

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
love to use this example but the stoner
63<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.860> infrared<00:00:53.460> scope<00:00:53.760> i<00:00:53.879> go<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.239> oh<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
63 with infrared scope i go like oh and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
63 with infrared scope i go like oh and
27<00:00:55.199> every<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.559> i<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.370> i<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
27 every time i actually think i have a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.299 
27 every time i actually think i have a
gameplay<00:00:57.030> where<00:00:57.149> i<00:00:57.210> went<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.510> oh<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.870> 33<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
gameplay where i went like oh and 33 and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.779 
gameplay where i went like oh and 33 and
i<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:01.020> don't<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.340> guys<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
i really don't think you guys want to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
i really don't think you guys want to
see<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> that's<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.159> think<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> oh

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
see that and that's like and think it oh

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
see that and that's like and think it oh
and<00:01:05.489> 33<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.060> completely<00:01:06.240> terrible<00:01:06.750> but

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and 33 is like completely terrible but

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
and 33 is like completely terrible but
that's<00:01:07.049> pretty<00:01:07.229> pretty<00:01:07.680> average<00:01:07.950> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that's pretty pretty average and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.910 
that's pretty pretty average and
consistent<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.030> i<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.119> using<00:01:09.330> that

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
consistent for me when i was using that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.710 
consistent for me when i was using that
so<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:10.950> cut<00:01:11.369> part<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:11.909> video<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> i

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so i cut part of this video out and i

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.240 
so i cut part of this video out and i
started<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.350> three<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:13.860> four<00:01:14.010> minutes

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
started it about three or four minutes

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.410 
started it about three or four minutes
into<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> game<00:01:14.640> play<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.240> kind<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
into the game play because it's kind of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
into the game play because it's kind of
long<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.920> also<00:01:17.070> didn't<00:01:17.430> even<00:01:17.580> finish

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
long and it also didn't even finish

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
long and it also didn't even finish
completely<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:18.900> reason<00:01:19.200> theater<00:01:19.650> mode

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
completely for some reason theater mode

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.760 
completely for some reason theater mode
wasn't<00:01:20.670> able<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> record<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.960> way<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
wasn't able to record it all the way to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
wasn't able to record it all the way to
the<00:01:22.860> end<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> only<00:01:23.490> goes<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.119> i

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the end so it only goes up to about i

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
the end so it only goes up to about i
think<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.680> actually<00:01:25.850> 172<00:01:26.850> 150<00:01:27.450> something

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
think it's actually 172 150 something

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
think it's actually 172 150 something
like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.159> still<00:01:29.280> good

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
like that which is it's still good

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.270 
like that which is it's still good
amount<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> see<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> my

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
amount you get to see a lot of it so my

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.940 
amount you get to see a lot of it so my
class<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.240> Galil<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.350> flamethrower
