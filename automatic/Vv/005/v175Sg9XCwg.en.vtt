00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 Y 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.950
 it was the best 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.670
 dt 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.670
 then today 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.990
 Hello such friends are youtube 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.400
 Welcome to this new video tutorial 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.500
 well this time I come to 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.740
 teach how to move a program 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.880
 installed to another partition easily 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.130
 very simple with a portable program 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.719
 well you will say that because 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.060
 I just do not copy the folder from 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.509
 program and hit it where I want but 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.789
 that really works but sometimes 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.990
 sometimes the program could not reach 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.179
 have failures 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 that shortcuts do not work 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.310
 correctly and that's why I'm in this 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 this time I brought you a program 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.679
 very good the first thing they are going to do is 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.810
 go to the video description link 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:56.030
 and when they have downloaded it they will 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.830
 right click and extract here 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 the program excel point will remain 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.210
 it's called moving style 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.080
 they will give you the right to execute as 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.080
 administrator 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.010
 and well you are not going to leave this 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.770
 I have it like that because I already had it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.560
 configured but you are going to see here 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 in these points and they will choose where 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.810
 they have installed or programs the folder 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.910
 in my case it 's program file should 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.260
 accept and they will come out all 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.680
 programs that you have installed 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.660
 and here a holder alternative are going to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.920
 select where you want 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.620
 move them ok 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.420
 in my case it is identical local c and in a 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.590
 folder called programs for the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.110
 accept and now they can only choose 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.150
 the program that you want me to 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.150
 matter of time you'll catch 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.640
 I'm going to choose the ski player 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.460
 trial forgiveness only if you simply 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.770
 select the folder the program from 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.870
 they want to move they select it and they go to 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.960
 give here on this arrow are going to give a 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.780
 click and you just direct with the cmd and 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.210
 It is already good already and the movi 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.020
 Program 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.020
 let's check 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.360
 I put it on the local disk of 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.250
 here programs and as you see here is already 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.250
 the program with all its documents and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.940
 files and to see that no 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.630
 shortcut was affected I'm going to open 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.630
 the chayo 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.459
 how I appeared here 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.450
 and as you see it opens perfectly that 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.190
 you can do it with any 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.600
 Program 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.240

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.970
