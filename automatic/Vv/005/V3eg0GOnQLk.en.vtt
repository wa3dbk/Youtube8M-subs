00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
hi-oh I like to do a video today on the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.990 
hi-oh I like to do a video today on the
dynamic<00:00:09.540> Benoni<00:00:10.200> system<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.370> Pannonia<00:00:11.850> is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
dynamic Benoni system so the Pannonia is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
dynamic Benoni system so the Pannonia is
a<00:00:12.030> system<00:00:12.570> against<00:00:13.080> D<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.559> when<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.580> play

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
a system against D for when you play

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.300 
a system against D for when you play
against<00:00:15.330> e4<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.770> either<00:00:16.950> try<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
against e4 you can either try and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550 
against e4 you can either try and
classically<00:00:17.910> occupy<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.779> center<00:00:19.200> say<00:00:19.380> with

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
classically occupy the center say with

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980 
classically occupy the center say with
d5<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> bit<00:00:21.180> stodgy<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
d5 and it's a bit stodgy this is the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.480 
d5 and it's a bit stodgy this is the
Queens<00:00:22.260> gambit<00:00:22.650> declined<00:00:23.600> or<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.869> can<00:00:25.020> play

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
Queens gambit declined or you can play

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.269 
Queens gambit declined or you can play
like<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.910> sloth<00:00:27.210> defense<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.980> really

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
like the sloth defense or if you really

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.580 
like the sloth defense or if you really
want<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> play<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.480> more<00:00:30.630> entertaining<00:00:31.140> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
want to play in a more entertaining you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
want to play in a more entertaining you
know<00:00:31.680> dynamic<00:00:32.220> aggressive<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.660> could

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
know dynamic aggressive way you could

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
know dynamic aggressive way you could
play<00:00:34.110> Knight<00:00:34.350> f6<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.420> after<00:00:36.420> c4<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:38.309> can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
play Knight f6 and after c4 you can

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.189 
play Knight f6 and after c4 you can
actually<00:00:38.610> play<00:00:38.909> the<00:00:39.059> moves<00:00:39.239> c5<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.080> this

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
actually play the moves c5 and this

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.740 
actually play the moves c5 and this
leads<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.650> benoni<00:00:41.040> systems<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.330> basically

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
leads to the benoni systems so basically

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.710 
leads to the benoni systems so basically
with<00:00:42.960> c5<00:00:43.610> you're<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.909> provoking<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
with c5 you're really provoking the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.020 
with c5 you're really provoking the
white<00:00:45.900> pawn<00:00:46.229> to<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.680> forward<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.699> doing<00:00:47.909> so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
white pawn to go forward and in doing so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.000 
white pawn to go forward and in doing so
you<00:00:48.330> know<00:00:48.420> white<00:00:48.659> is<00:00:48.839> weakening<00:00:49.379> these<00:00:49.739> dark

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you know white is weakening these dark

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
you know white is weakening these dark
squares<00:00:50.400> so<00:00:51.089> that's<00:00:51.269> potentially<00:00:51.600> useful<00:00:52.080> if

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
squares so that's potentially useful if

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.140 
squares so that's potentially useful if
you<00:00:52.589> later<00:00:53.010> finch<00:00:53.400> shatter<00:00:53.580> your<00:00:53.820> bishop

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
you later finch shatter your bishop

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.000 
you later finch shatter your bishop
you're<00:00:54.330> gaining<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.900> very<00:00:55.379> nice<00:00:55.559> bishop

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you're gaining a very nice bishop

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.579 
you're gaining a very nice bishop
sometimes<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.119> not<00:00:57.299> only<00:00:57.479> that<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.409> one

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
sometimes but not only that when one

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.310 
sometimes but not only that when one
moves<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:59.070> pawn<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.369> d5<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.180> means<00:01:00.479> that<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
moves the pawn to d5 it means that you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.829 
moves the pawn to d5 it means that you
can<00:01:01.440> later<00:01:01.619> undermine<00:01:02.309> potentially<00:01:03.119> with<00:01:03.239> b5

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
can later undermine potentially with b5

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.800 
can later undermine potentially with b5
or<00:01:04.199> prepare<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.860> 6<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> b5<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
or prepare it with a 6 and b5 and this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.600 
or prepare it with a 6 and b5 and this
pawn<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.260> become<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> target<00:01:07.890> especially<00:01:08.490> if

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
pawn will become a target especially if

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
pawn will become a target especially if
you<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.850> bishop<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.329> b7<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.649> there's<00:01:10.829> all

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you get a bishop to b7 so there's all

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
you get a bishop to b7 so there's all
sorts<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.759> love<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:12.539> ideas<00:01:12.750> which

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
sorts of this I love these ideas which

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
sorts of this I love these ideas which
all<00:01:13.439> stem<00:01:13.770> from<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:14.159> provocation<00:01:14.579> move<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
kingside structurally you know what's

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.999 
kingside structurally you know what's
happened<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.569> is<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.079> white<00:01:52.289> pawn<00:01:52.649> has

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
happened here is that the white pawn has

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.709 
happened here is that the white pawn has
gone<00:01:53.249> from<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> Queen<00:01:53.789> side<00:01:53.999> to<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.299> center

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
you know it has this d6 target you know

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.080 
you know it has this d6 target you know
which<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.679> later<00:02:11.220> probes<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.850> know<00:02:11.970> we've

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
which can be later probes you know we've

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.509 
which can be later probes you know we've
moves<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.450> Bishop<00:02:12.750> f4<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:14.069> white<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
moves like Bishop f4 and if white you

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.119 
moves like Bishop f4 and if white you
know<00:02:14.610> often<00:02:14.970> gangs<00:02:15.269> up<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.080> d6<00:02:16.920> but

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
know often gangs up on that d6 but

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.500 
know often gangs up on that d6 but
maneuvers<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.030> know

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
maneuvers like you know

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.210 
maneuvers like you know
VTT<00:02:19.019> d2<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.099> c4<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.090> black<00:02:21.450> structurally<00:02:22.220> has

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
VTT d2 to c4 so black structurally has

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
VTT d2 to c4 so black structurally has
got<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.579> you<00:02:23.849> know<00:02:23.970> measly<00:02:24.420> d6<00:02:25.170> point<00:02:25.439> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
got this you know measly d6 point and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.830 
got this you know measly d6 point and
tries<00:02:25.829> to<00:02:26.040> hold<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.640> know<00:02:26.760> f45<00:02:27.420> which

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
tries to hold up you know f45 which

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.839 
tries to hold up you know f45 which
could<00:02:28.019> be<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> thematic<00:02:28.319> break<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.189> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
could be a thematic break in the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.420 
could be a thematic break in the
position<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.079> know<00:02:31.200> black<00:02:31.470> does<00:02:32.129> have

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
position but you know black does have

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.460 
position but you know black does have
some<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.090> know<00:02:33.120> dark<00:02:33.480> square<00:02:33.810> can't<00:02:34.110> play<00:02:34.319> if

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
some you know dark square can't play if

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.920 
some you know dark square can't play if
he<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.799> clamp<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.420> dark<00:02:36.659> squares

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
he can clamp down on the dark squares

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.539 
he can clamp down on the dark squares
later<00:02:37.170> fianchetto<00:02:37.680> his<00:02:37.799> bishop<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
later fianchetto his bishop and

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.670 
later fianchetto his bishop and
potentially<00:02:39.450> he's<00:02:39.540> also<00:02:39.690> got<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> queen<00:02:40.379> side

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
potentially he's also got a queen side

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.530 
potentially he's also got a queen side
poor<00:02:40.950> majority<00:02:41.129> free<00:02:41.700> pools<00:02:41.970> here<00:02:42.239> against

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
poor majority free pools here against

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.309 
poor majority free pools here against
the<00:02:42.659> two<00:02:42.840> pawns

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
the two pawns

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.110 
the two pawns
so<00:02:43.769> if<00:02:43.890> black<00:02:44.099> can<00:02:44.280> arrange<00:02:44.549> counter<00:02:44.970> play

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so if black can arrange counter play

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.920 
so if black can arrange counter play
layout<00:02:45.329> with<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.599> six<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.019> b5<00:02:46.530> that's<00:02:47.280> good<00:02:47.930> but

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
layout with a six and b5 that's good but

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.740 
layout with a six and b5 that's good but
um<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.439> situation<00:02:50.069> got<00:02:50.280> worse<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:51.269> there

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
um the situation got worse when there

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.539 
um the situation got worse when there
was<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> key<00:02:52.230> game<00:02:52.500> where<00:02:52.739> John<00:02:53.010> lund<00:02:53.220> had<00:02:53.370> just

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
was a key game where John lund had just

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.580 
was a key game where John lund had just
written<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.879> book<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.049> modern<00:02:55.349> without

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
written a book on the modern without

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.420 
written a book on the modern without
team<00:02:55.799> baloney<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.579> he'd<00:02:57.120> been<00:02:57.299> blasted<00:02:57.959> by

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
team baloney and he'd been blasted by

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.270 
team baloney and he'd been blasted by
Garry<00:02:59.430> Kasparov<00:03:00.230> using<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.440> believe<00:03:02.159> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
Garry Kasparov using I believe the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.520 
Garry Kasparov using I believe the
dangerous<00:03:02.639> timing<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.420> system<00:03:04.139> so<00:03:04.859> basically

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
dangerous timing of system so basically

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.430 
dangerous timing of system so basically
because<00:03:07.530> I've<00:03:07.739> played<00:03:09.019> let's<00:03:10.019> let's<00:03:10.260> go<00:03:10.409> back

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
because I've played let's let's go back

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.369 
because I've played let's let's go back
so<00:03:10.799> II<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.220> d<00:03:11.549> 6g<00:03:12.060> 6<00:03:13.400> f4<00:03:14.870> very<00:03:15.870> aggressive<00:03:16.260> move

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
so II for d 6g 6 f4 very aggressive move

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.750 
so II for d 6g 6 f4 very aggressive move
immediately<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:17.099> know<00:03:17.190> trying<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> swamp

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
immediately you know trying to swamp

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.849 
immediately you know trying to swamp
black<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.180> center<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:19.049> now<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.409> Bishop

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
black in the center and now this Bishop

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.550 
black in the center and now this Bishop
b5<00:03:20.370> check<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:22.019> there's<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.319> load<00:03:22.530> of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
b5 check and that there's a load of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.170 
b5 check and that there's a load of
theory<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.900> black<00:03:25.099> plays<00:03:26.099> either<00:03:26.370> nightly<00:03:26.879> 7

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
theory if black plays either nightly 7

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
theory if black plays either nightly 7
or<00:03:27.269> Bishop<00:03:27.569> d7<00:03:29.419> basically<00:03:30.419> in<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.569> whites<00:03:30.840> kind

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
or Bishop d7 basically in a whites kind

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.890 
or Bishop d7 basically in a whites kind
of<00:03:31.620> winning<00:03:31.949> a<00:03:32.040> piece<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.639> in<00:03:33.480> some<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> these

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
of winning a piece in in some of these

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.809 
of winning a piece in in some of these
variations<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.650> there's<00:03:35.010> just<00:03:35.280> tons<00:03:35.549> of

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
variations and there's just tons of

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.409 
variations and there's just tons of
variations<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.419> consider<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.650> um<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.879> so<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
variations to consider but um so so the

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.569 
variations to consider but um so so the
move<00:03:39.599> which<00:03:39.840> John<00:03:40.530> none<00:03:40.739> played<00:03:41.010> was<00:03:41.220> night<00:03:41.400> f

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
move which John none played was night f

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.509 
move which John none played was night f
d7<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.959> have<00:03:43.139> video<00:03:43.470> annotated<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.310> game

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
d7 and I have video annotated that game

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
d7 and I have video annotated that game
if<00:03:44.669> you<00:03:44.760> look<00:03:44.910> for<00:03:45.090> Kasparov<00:03:45.540> or<00:03:45.690> none<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.440> your

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
if you look for Kasparov or none in your

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.379 
if you look for Kasparov or none in your
search<00:03:46.889> keywords<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.849> can<00:03:48.000> see<00:03:48.209> what

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
search keywords you can see what

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.150 
search keywords you can see what
happened<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:48.959> game<00:03:49.169> but<00:03:49.620> basically<00:03:49.980> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
happened in that game but basically you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.400 
happened in that game but basically you
expose<00:03:50.579> when<00:03:51.299> he<00:03:51.389> canceled<00:03:51.810> Queen<00:03:52.019> so<00:03:52.199> later

expose when he canceled Queen so later

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.729 
expose when he canceled Queen so later
you<00:03:52.680> know<00:03:52.799> he<00:03:52.980> sorry<00:03:53.669> King<00:03:53.879> side<00:03:54.090> he<00:03:54.510> later

f4<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.609> quite<00:03:59.849> nasty<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.690> John<00:04:00.840> none<00:04:01.049> but

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
f4 it was quite nasty for John none but

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.770 
f4 it was quite nasty for John none but
after<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.519> game<00:04:02.970> basically<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:03.629> the

went<00:04:06.780> down<00:04:07.019> considerably<00:04:07.970> but<00:04:08.970> um<00:04:09.680> there<00:04:10.680> are

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
went down considerably but um there are

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.830 
went down considerably but um there are
other<00:04:11.069> ways<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.549> playing<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.389> dynamic

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
other ways of playing the dynamic

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.460 
other ways of playing the dynamic
Bologna

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
Bologna

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.069 
Bologna
if<00:04:13.709> we<00:04:13.889> go<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.310> let's<00:04:14.970> have<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.150> look<00:04:15.449> at<00:04:15.870> other

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
if we go back let's have a look at other

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.680 
if we go back let's have a look at other
ways<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.459> that's<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.970> modern<00:04:18.150> Moloney

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
ways so that's the modern Moloney

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.080 
ways so that's the modern Moloney
which<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.949> basically<00:04:20.370> became<00:04:20.760> far<00:04:21.060> less

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
which you know basically became far less

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.659 
which you know basically became far less
popular<00:04:21.690> after<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.199> key<00:04:22.409> encounter<00:04:23.010> between

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
popular after that key encounter between

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.640 
popular after that key encounter between
Kasparov<00:04:24.539> playing<00:04:24.780> white<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.199> John<00:04:25.440> non

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
Kasparov playing white and John non

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.140 
Kasparov playing white and John non
playing<00:04:25.949> black<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.590> Scheck<00:04:28.889> Benoni<00:04:29.310> so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
playing black but the Scheck Benoni so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.990 
playing black but the Scheck Benoni so
basically<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.110> shank<00:04:31.380> bone

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
basically the shank bone

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.280 
basically the shank bone
d4<00:04:33.000> Knight<00:04:33.330> f6<00:04:36.680> c4<00:04:37.680> c5<00:04:38.280> d5<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.390> now<00:04:39.930> if<00:04:40.140> black

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
d4 Knight f6 c4 c5 d5 and now if black

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.820 
d4 Knight f6 c4 c5 d5 and now if black
plays<00:04:40.650> d5<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:42.180> that's<00:04:42.420> an<00:04:42.600> interesting<00:04:43.140> way<00:04:43.800> of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
plays d5 so that's an interesting way of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.060 
plays d5 so that's an interesting way of
playing<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.460> position

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
playing the position

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.430 
playing the position
so<00:04:47.070> with<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.580> some<00:04:47.970> blacks<00:04:48.900> can<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.170> later

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
so with that some blacks can a later

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.540 
so with that some blacks can a later
play<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:50.040> d6<00:04:50.940> move<00:04:51.240> so<00:04:51.900> say<00:04:52.110> that's<00:04:52.890> let's<00:04:53.250> find

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
play a d6 move so say that's let's find

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.050 
play a d6 move so say that's let's find
some<00:04:53.790> ideas<00:04:54.210> Bishop<00:04:54.600> e7<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:56.610> strategy

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
some ideas Bishop e7 and the strategy

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.930 
some ideas Bishop e7 and the strategy
here<00:04:57.300> for<00:04:57.510> black<00:04:57.690> black<00:04:58.590> has<00:04:59.160> got<00:04:59.400> these<00:04:59.610> dark

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
here for black black has got these dark

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.230 
here for black black has got these dark
pawns<00:05:00.270> dark<00:05:00.990> square<00:05:01.260> pawns<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.430> his<00:05:02.910> bishops

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
pawns dark square pawns and his bishops

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.830 
pawns dark square pawns and his bishops
hand<00:05:03.450> in

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
hand in

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840 
hand in
so<00:05:04.170> basically<00:05:04.590> strategically<00:05:05.340> if<00:05:05.520> he<00:05:05.700> can

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
so basically strategically if he can

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.030 
so basically strategically if he can
exchange<00:05:06.090> off<00:05:06.450> this<00:05:06.690> bishop<00:05:07.110> for<00:05:07.470> that<00:05:07.680> Bishop

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
exchange off this bishop for that Bishop

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.730 
exchange off this bishop for that Bishop
later<00:05:08.340> where<00:05:09.090> same<00:05:09.360> moves<00:05:09.600> like<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:10.560> weird

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
later where same moves like the weird

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.430 
later where same moves like the weird
looking<00:05:11.010> like<00:05:11.190> h7<00:05:11.670> Bishop<00:05:11.880> g5<00:05:12.270> then<00:05:13.260> he's

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
looking like h7 Bishop g5 then he's

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.230 
looking like h7 Bishop g5 then he's
gonna<00:05:13.560> have<00:05:13.800> nice<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.490> know<00:05:14.640> dark<00:05:14.940> square

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
gonna have nice you know dark square

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.840 
gonna have nice you know dark square
outpost<00:05:15.780> potentially<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.470> aim<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:16.680> so<00:05:17.670> that's

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
outpost potentially to aim for so that's

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.210 
outpost potentially to aim for so that's
the<00:05:18.030> strategy<00:05:18.240> for<00:05:18.840> black<00:05:19.050> white<00:05:19.920> on<00:05:19.980> the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
the strategy for black white on the

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.130 
the strategy for black white on the
other<00:05:20.370> hand<00:05:20.670> has<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:21.090> biting<00:05:21.540> point<00:05:21.840> this

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
other hand has this biting point this

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.680 
other hand has this biting point this
ePHI<00:05:22.650> pawn<00:05:22.980> so<00:05:23.460> if<00:05:23.580> white<00:05:23.820> can<00:05:24.060> later<00:05:24.210> arrange

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
ePHI pawn so if white can later arrange

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.070 
ePHI pawn so if white can later arrange
for<00:05:24.870> f4<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:25.620> then<00:05:26.190> advantageous<00:05:26.850> way<00:05:27.750> and

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
for f4 and then advantageous way and

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.710 
for f4 and then advantageous way and
black<00:05:28.680> has<00:05:28.920> to<00:05:29.100> play<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.670> know<00:05:29.700> he<00:05:30.180> takes<00:05:30.450> F

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
black has to play you know he takes F

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.050 
black has to play you know he takes F
and<00:05:31.320> say<00:05:31.530> Bishop<00:05:31.860> takes<00:05:32.040> black<00:05:32.550> will<00:05:32.790> again

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
and say Bishop takes black will again

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.670 
and say Bishop takes black will again
like<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.420> modern<00:05:33.720> baloney<00:05:33.990> be<00:05:34.290> left<00:05:34.500> with

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
like the modern baloney be left with

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.600 
like the modern baloney be left with
this<00:05:34.800> structural<00:05:35.370> problem<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.420> d6<00:05:36.960> pawn<00:05:37.610> you

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
this structural problem this d6 pawn you

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.320 
this structural problem this d6 pawn you
know<00:05:38.730> which<00:05:38.880> can<00:05:39.030> be<00:05:39.120> later<00:05:39.330> pros<00:05:39.980> so<00:05:41.330> but

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
know which can be later pros so but

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.290 
know which can be later pros so but
that's<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:42.690> Scheck<00:05:42.960> benoni

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
that's the Scheck benoni

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.390 
that's the Scheck benoni
so<00:05:45.300> if<00:05:45.570> you<00:05:45.750> like<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.410> closed<00:05:46.710> nature<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.250> it

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
so if you like the closed nature of it

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.950 
so if you like the closed nature of it
you<00:05:47.520> know<00:05:47.640> and<00:05:47.850> manage<00:05:48.390> your<00:05:48.480> exchange<00:05:48.810> off

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
you know and manage your exchange off

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.330 
you know and manage your exchange off
your<00:05:49.140> dark<00:05:49.320> square<00:05:49.560> Bishop<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:49.980> could<00:05:50.130> get

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
your dark square Bishop you could get

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.830 
your dark square Bishop you could get
some<00:05:50.550> some<00:05:50.910> good<00:05:51.060> results<00:05:51.240> out<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.750> that

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
some some good results out of that

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.830 
some some good results out of that
especially<00:05:52.560> in<00:05:52.980> blitz<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:54.240> clothes<00:05:54.510> baloney

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
especially in blitz the clothes baloney

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.020 
especially in blitz the clothes baloney
is<00:05:55.050> kind<00:05:55.260> of<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:56.040> same<00:05:56.250> kind<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.640> idea<00:05:57.000> but

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
is kind of the same kind of idea but

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.250 
is kind of the same kind of idea but
immediately<00:05:57.840> after<00:05:58.290> d4<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.810> in<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.050> close

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
immediately after d4 so in the close

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.730 
immediately after d4 so in the close
baloney

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
baloney

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.760 
baloney
playing<00:06:02.250> immediately<00:06:02.640> c5<00:06:03.480> so<00:06:04.200> provoking

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
playing immediately c5 so provoking

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.560 
playing immediately c5 so provoking
immediately<00:06:05.340> the<00:06:05.460> white<00:06:05.610> pawns<00:06:05.910> go<00:06:06.150> forward

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
immediately the white pawns go forward

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.370 
immediately the white pawns go forward
and<00:06:07.340> now<00:06:08.340> II<00:06:09.380> five<00:06:11.540> but<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:12.900> difference<00:06:13.290> here

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
and now II five but the difference here

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.440 
and now II five but the difference here
is<00:06:13.980> that<00:06:14.220> you<00:06:14.520> know<00:06:14.610> white<00:06:14.820> hasn't<00:06:15.180> committed

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
is that you know white hasn't committed

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.860 
is that you know white hasn't committed
that<00:06:15.720> night<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:16.200> see<00:06:16.410> free<00:06:16.710> yet<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:18.240> basically

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
that night to see free yet so basically

immediately it's just why it's lost a

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.490 
immediately it's just why it's lost a
bit<00:07:06.240> of<00:07:06.300> control<00:07:06.510> of<00:07:06.690> the<00:07:06.780> center<00:07:07.110> isn't<00:07:07.230> it's
