and we'll make a slice right over the

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.250 
and we'll make a slice right over the
top<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.990> them<00:02:10.080> first<00:02:10.380> straight<00:02:10.830> down<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.990> you

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
top of them first straight down and you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.110 
top of them first straight down and you
can<00:02:13.470> feel<00:02:13.740> these<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.370> down<00:02:14.580> about<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.850> quarter

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
can feel these go down about a quarter

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.850 
can feel these go down about a quarter
inch<00:02:15.300> into<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> meat<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.320> feel<00:02:16.590> what

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
inch into the meat you can feel what

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.950 
inch into the meat you can feel what
bones<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.550> then<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.820> make<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.270> angle<00:02:18.780> your

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
bones so then you make your angle your

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.070 
bones so then you make your angle your
knife<00:02:19.140> out<00:02:19.470> toward<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.920> back<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.870> make

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
knife out toward the back and make

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.590 
knife out toward the back and make
another<00:02:22.380> slice<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.610> bought<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.150> skin

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
another slice just bought to the skin

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.350 
another slice just bought to the skin
and<00:02:25.500> then<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> second<00:02:26.490> slice<00:02:26.760> underneath

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
and then the second slice underneath

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.730 
and then the second slice underneath
them<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.960> be<00:02:28.020> rate<00:02:28.350> from<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
them is going to be rate from the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.440 
them is going to be rate from the
lateral<00:02:29.100> line<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> 45<00:02:30.420> degree<00:02:30.660> angle<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
lateral line at a 45 degree angle and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.790 
lateral line at a 45 degree angle and
that<00:02:33.450> pretty<00:02:33.690> much<00:02:33.810> gets<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.500> underneath

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
that pretty much gets right underneath

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.930 
that pretty much gets right underneath
the<00:02:35.070> Y<00:02:35.190> bones<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.460> remove<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the Y bones and you can just remove that

the Y bones and you can just remove that
strip<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.720> meat<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.200> that's<00:02:46.440> all<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.950> bones

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.950 
in the filet right there and the Y bones
are<00:02:50.220> located<00:02:50.760> about<00:02:51.000> 1/4<00:02:51.300> inch<00:02:51.480> above<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
lateral line and we're going to make a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.620 
lateral line and we're going to make a
cut<00:02:54.060> right<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.570> top<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.080> them<00:02:55.410> first<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:57.330> cut

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the Y bones and Don about 1/4 inch into

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.330 
the Y bones and Don about 1/4 inch into
the<00:03:02.640> flesh<00:03:03.000> you'll<00:03:03.270> feel<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.690> with<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.870> knife

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
the flesh you'll feel them with a knife

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.520

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
well the second cut you make at a 45

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.820 
well the second cut you make at a 45
degree<00:03:07.560> angle<00:03:08.810> now<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:09.989> pretty<00:03:10.200> close<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
degree angle now I'm pretty close to the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.510 
degree angle now I'm pretty close to the
skin<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.820> that's<00:03:12.630> one<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.080> cut<00:03:13.260> their<00:03:13.530> second

cut is right at the lateral line at a 45
degree<00:03:17.370> angle<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.950> pretty<00:03:20.370> much<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.640> was

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
degree angle and pretty much that was

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.560 
degree angle and pretty much that was
right<00:03:21.420> underneath<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.930> rib<00:03:22.769> or<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.820> rule<00:03:24.450> of

right underneath that rib or the rule of

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.530 
right underneath that rib or the rule of
Y<00:03:25.110> bones<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.730> pretty<00:03:27.000> much<00:03:27.090> peel

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
Y bones you can just pretty much peel

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.800 
Y bones you can just pretty much peel
that<00:03:27.750> right<00:03:27.810> off<00:03:28.050> like<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> makes

that right off like that and that makes

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.170 
that right off like that and that makes
a<00:03:30.989> boneless<00:03:31.230> filet<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:32.790> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.000> go<00:03:33.090> ahead

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
a boneless filet I'm going to go ahead

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.720 
a boneless filet I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:33.420> skin<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.900> fish<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:35.730> hand<00:03:35.970> knife<00:03:37.730> in

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
angle and just a sighing motion and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.199 
angle and just a sighing motion and
don't<00:03:44.160> press<00:03:44.400> down<00:03:44.760> too<00:03:45.030> hard<00:03:46.790> or<00:03:47.790> you'll<00:03:48.030> cut

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
don't press down too hard or you'll cut

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.509 
don't press down too hard or you'll cut
through<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.570> skin<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.110> northern<00:03:49.530> which
