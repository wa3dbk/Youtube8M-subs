here now a car stands for aka adaptive
rail<00:00:31.449> system<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.110> basically<00:00:32.949> what's<00:00:33.610> going

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
rail system and basically what's going

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.560 
rail system and basically what's going
to<00:00:34.150> include<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.790> rail<00:00:36.790> system<00:00:37.239> on<00:00:37.360> top

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
to include is the rail system on top

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.619 
to include is the rail system on top
here<00:00:37.900> which<00:00:38.409> includes<00:00:38.830> a<00:00:39.269> replacement<00:00:40.269> rear

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
here which includes a replacement rear

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.049 
here which includes a replacement rear
sight<00:00:40.900> leaf<00:00:41.110> which<00:00:41.949> also<00:00:42.190> has<00:00:42.460> backup<00:00:42.909> iron

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
sight leaf which also has backup iron

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.359 
sight leaf which also has backup iron
sights<00:00:43.479> which<00:00:43.720> is<00:00:43.869> real<00:00:44.080> nice<00:00:44.229> and<00:00:45.070> it's<00:00:45.220> also

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:45.369 
sights which is real nice and it's also

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:46.799 
sights which is real nice and it's also
going<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.670> come<00:00:45.820> with<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.089> replacement<00:00:46.449> top

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
going to come with the replacement top

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.289 
going to come with the replacement top
cover<00:00:47.110> too<00:00:47.470> the<00:00:48.280> reason<00:00:48.640> for<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.269> because

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
cover too the reason for that is because

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.380 
cover too the reason for that is because
the<00:00:49.839> ACARS<00:00:50.199> system<00:00:50.320> mounts<00:00:51.100> to<00:00:51.369> not<00:00:51.850> only<00:00:52.030> just

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the ACARS system mounts to not only just

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.680 
the ACARS system mounts to not only just
the<00:00:53.140> rear<00:00:53.559> sight<00:00:53.860> leaf<00:00:54.070> area<00:00:54.309> but<00:00:55.030> also<00:00:55.180> mounts

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
the rear sight leaf area but also mounts

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.299 
the rear sight leaf area but also mounts
to<00:00:55.869> the<00:00:56.019> top<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.470> the<00:00:57.250> rear<00:00:58.030> cover<00:00:59.189> the<00:01:00.189> way

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
to the top of the rear cover the way

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.600 
to the top of the rear cover the way
that<00:01:00.519> works<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.030> fairly<00:01:01.600> simple

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
that works is fairly simple

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.520 
that works is fairly simple
it<00:01:03.610> works<00:01:03.939> on<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.150> hinge<00:01:04.420> system<00:01:04.629> up<00:01:05.019> with<00:01:05.350> your

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
it works on a hinge system up with your

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.929 
it works on a hinge system up with your
rear<00:01:05.710> sight<00:01:05.979> leaf<00:01:06.189> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.350> there's<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:09.009> few

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
rear sight leaf and then there's a few

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.840 
rear sight leaf and then there's a few
small<00:01:10.119> indexing<00:01:10.929> pins<00:01:11.200> that<00:01:11.829> slide<00:01:12.460> into<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
small indexing pins that slide into the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.060 
small indexing pins that slide into the
back<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.240> rail<00:01:13.420> section<00:01:13.960> what's<00:01:14.799> really

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
back of the rail section what's really

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.340 
back of the rail section what's really
nice<00:01:15.219> about<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.700> system<00:01:16.149> is<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.450> should<00:01:17.259> you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
nice about the system is that should you

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.800 
nice about the system is that should you
need<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.850> field-strip<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.119> weapon<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:19.600> some

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
need to field-strip the weapon for some

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.450 
need to field-strip the weapon for some
reason<00:01:20.170> or<00:01:20.350> clean<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.799> weapon<00:01:21.100> while<00:01:21.310> you're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
reason or clean the weapon while you're

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.669 
reason or clean the weapon while you're
out<00:01:21.579> in<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.789> field<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.689> can<00:01:23.170> do<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.439> easily

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
out in the field you can do so easily

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.440 
out in the field you can do so easily
without<00:01:24.009> having<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.579> lose<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.969> zero<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.420> your

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
without having to lose the zero on your

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.499 
without having to lose the zero on your
optics<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:27.189> this<00:01:27.460> gun<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.880> particular<00:01:28.179> I'm

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
optics on this gun in particular I'm

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.289 
optics on this gun in particular I'm
running<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.869> burst<00:01:29.200> fast<00:01:29.409> fire<00:01:29.759> 3/8<00:01:30.759> MOA<00:01:31.149> dot

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
running a burst fast fire 3/8 MOA dot

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.239 
running a burst fast fire 3/8 MOA dot
and<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:32.140> love<00:01:32.380> it

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
and I love it

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.399 
and I love it
this<00:01:33.759> combined<00:01:34.210> with<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.390> platform<00:01:34.990> makes<00:01:35.229> it

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
this combined with the platform makes it

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.330 
this combined with the platform makes it
an<00:01:35.710> awesome<00:01:35.950> shooting<00:01:36.490> weapon<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:39.100> great

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
an awesome shooting weapon it's great

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.639 
an awesome shooting weapon it's great
for<00:01:39.490> combat<00:01:39.909> accuracy<00:01:40.479> inside<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.929> 100<00:01:41.289> yards

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
for combat accuracy inside of 100 yards

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.800 
for combat accuracy inside of 100 yards
it's<00:01:41.799> fast<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.549> lot<00:01:42.819> faster<00:01:43.270> than<00:01:43.390> using<00:01:43.719> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
it's fast a lot faster than using the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.870 
it's fast a lot faster than using the
iron<00:01:43.929> sights<00:01:44.319> on<00:01:44.499> the<00:01:44.590> drinko<00:01:44.920> pistol<00:01:45.340> so

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
iron sights on the drinko pistol so

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.230 
iron sights on the drinko pistol so
that's<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.659> got<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:47.619> attention<00:01:48.069> so<00:01:48.789> it's

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
that's what got it my attention so it's

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
that's what got it my attention so it's
like<00:01:49.569> I<00:01:49.600> said<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:49.960> pretty<00:01:50.079> quick<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.530> go<00:01:50.649> on

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
like I said it's pretty quick to go on

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.679 
like I said it's pretty quick to go on
basically<00:01:51.880> you're<00:01:51.999> going<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.270> remove<00:01:52.539> your

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
basically you're going to remove your

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.319 
basically you're going to remove your
rear<00:01:52.749> sight<00:01:53.170> leaf<00:01:53.380> there's<00:01:54.249> a<00:01:54.340> spring

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
rear sight leaf there's a spring

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.300 
rear sight leaf there's a spring
underneath<00:01:55.630> there<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.049> does<00:01:56.889> have<00:01:57.069> a<00:01:57.100> lot<00:01:57.280> of

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
underneath there that does have a lot of

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.950 
underneath there that does have a lot of
tension<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.909> so<00:01:58.240> that's<00:01:58.389> probably<00:01:58.689> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
tension on it so that's probably the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.559 
tension on it so that's probably the
most<00:01:59.109> difficult<00:01:59.560> part<00:02:00.179> you're<00:02:01.179> basically

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
most difficult part you're basically

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.449 
most difficult part you're basically
going<00:02:01.749> to<00:02:01.810> push<00:02:02.049> down<00:02:02.259> on<00:02:02.319> your<00:02:02.560> rear<00:02:03.189> sight

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
going to push down on your rear sight

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.849 
going to push down on your rear sight
leaf<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.119> slide<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.600> off<00:02:04.749> and<00:02:05.079> slide<00:02:05.380> this

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
leaf and slide it off and slide this

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.029 
leaf and slide it off and slide this
system<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.459> so<00:02:07.299> they<00:02:07.990> also<00:02:08.289> they<00:02:08.410> do<00:02:08.470> include<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
system in so they also they do include a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.390 
system in so they also they do include a
new<00:02:09.190> top<00:02:09.429> cover<00:02:09.729> with<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.720> ACARS<00:02:11.140> system

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
new top cover with the ACARS system

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.960 
new top cover with the ACARS system
basically<00:02:12.400> because<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.240> have<00:02:13.270> to

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
basically because you do have to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.690 
basically because you do have to
this<00:02:14.690> piece<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.560> top<00:02:15.680> cover<00:02:16.130> which

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
this piece to the top cover which

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.130 
this piece to the top cover which
requires<00:02:17.090> having<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.570> slot<00:02:17.870> that's

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
requires having a slot that's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.590 
requires having a slot that's
manufactured<00:02:18.980> into<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.460> top<00:02:19.610> cover<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
manufactured into the top cover so it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.040 
manufactured into the top cover so it
does<00:02:20.780> come<00:02:20.990> with<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:22.360> again<00:02:23.360> like<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.720> said<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
does come with it again like it said the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.290 
does come with it again like it said the
indexing<00:02:24.500> pin<00:02:24.680> slide<00:02:25.070> into<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.460> rail<00:02:25.640> just

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
indexing pin slide into the rail just

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.110 
indexing pin slide into the rail just
like<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.560> when<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.830> go<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
like so and then when you go to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.610 
like so and then when you go to
reassemble<00:02:29.120> your<00:02:29.210> gun<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:30.290> gonna<00:02:30.380> put

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
reassemble your gun you're gonna put

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.320 
reassemble your gun you're gonna put
your<00:02:30.740> top<00:02:30.920> cover<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.400> basically<00:02:31.910> like<00:02:32.210> you

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
your top cover on basically like you

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.440 
your top cover on basically like you
would<00:02:32.540> as<00:02:33.050> if<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.470> were<00:02:33.560> assembling<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.640> normal

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
would as if you were assembling a normal

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.900 
would as if you were assembling a normal
pop<00:02:35.630> cover<00:02:36.070> now<00:02:37.070> I'd<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.340> lying<00:02:37.550> if<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.850> said
