Taylor with gas powered games and we're
back<00:00:17.920> today<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:19.240> specifically<00:00:20.080> to<00:00:20.320> talk

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
back today very specifically to talk

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.830 
back today very specifically to talk
about<00:00:21.010> a<00:00:21.040> couple<00:00:21.550> of<00:00:21.790> different<00:00:21.970> strategies

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
about a couple of different strategies

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.120 
about a couple of different strategies
and<00:00:23.200> how<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.130> tech<00:00:24.760> tree<00:00:25.119> ties<00:00:25.810> into<00:00:26.080> that<00:00:26.199> now

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
and how the tech tree ties into that now

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.370 
and how the tech tree ties into that now
we've<00:00:27.609> got<00:00:27.820> kind<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.359> a<00:00:28.539> hypothetical

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
we've got kind of a hypothetical

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.560 
we've got kind of a hypothetical
situation<00:00:29.740> here<00:00:30.430> where<00:00:30.670> we've<00:00:30.820> got<00:00:30.850> a<00:00:31.029> uef

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
situation here where we've got a uef

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.320 
situation here where we've got a uef
player<00:00:31.869> and<00:00:32.470> we've<00:00:32.590> got<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.770> cyber<00:00:33.220> player<00:00:33.640> and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
player and we've got a cyber player and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.360 
player and we've got a cyber player and
we're<00:00:34.629> gonna<00:00:34.750> just<00:00:35.019> basically<00:00:35.230> take<00:00:35.920> this<00:00:36.070> big

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
we're gonna just basically take this big

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.460 
we're gonna just basically take this big
army<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.000> we're<00:00:37.390> going<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.570> attack<00:00:37.989> Ruef

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
army and we're going to attack Ruef

player<00:00:38.800> this<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.160> classic<00:00:40.120> beginning<00:00:40.629> where

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
player this is a classic beginning where

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.170 
player this is a classic beginning where
you<00:00:41.350> get<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.530> ground<00:00:41.739> rush<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.460> you're<00:00:43.030> not

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
you get a ground rush and you're not

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.119 
you get a ground rush and you're not
ready<00:00:43.420> for<00:00:43.659> it<00:00:43.720> we<00:00:44.440> really<00:00:44.769> should<00:00:44.920> have<00:00:44.949> had

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
ready for it we really should have had

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.979 
ready for it we really should have had
some<00:00:45.339> point<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.670> fans<00:00:45.970> it's<00:00:46.330> an<00:00:46.449> air<00:00:46.629> defense

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
some point to fans it's an air defense

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.930 
some point to fans it's an air defense
and<00:00:47.470> we're<00:00:47.739> gonna<00:00:47.830> just<00:00:48.100> go<00:00:48.220> ahead<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.640> build

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
and we're gonna just go ahead and build

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.820 
and we're gonna just go ahead and build
some<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:49.449> then<00:00:49.839> when<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.110> cyber<00:00:50.320> an<00:00:50.500> opponent

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
some and then when the cyber an opponent

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.770 
some and then when the cyber an opponent
comes<00:00:50.979> in<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.519> tries<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.059> finish<00:00:52.479> us<00:00:52.629> off

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
comes in and tries to finish us off

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.439 
comes in and tries to finish us off
we're<00:00:53.620> ready<00:00:53.890> for<00:00:54.010> them<00:00:54.400> this<00:00:54.549> time<00:00:54.820> now<00:00:55.360> this

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
we're ready for them this time now this

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.180 
we're ready for them this time now this
is<00:00:55.510> pretty<00:00:55.809> straightforward<00:00:56.080> but<00:00:56.620> we've<00:00:56.949> got

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
is pretty straightforward but we've got

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.119 
is pretty straightforward but we've got
to<00:00:57.339> have<00:00:57.580> a<00:00:57.820> bigger<00:00:58.330> plan<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:59.140> master<00:00:59.860> plan

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
to have a bigger plan a master plan

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.280 
to have a bigger plan a master plan
eight<00:01:00.369> all<00:01:00.729> much<00:01:01.119> larger<00:01:01.780> far-reaching

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
eight all much larger far-reaching

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.259 
eight all much larger far-reaching
strategy<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.369> that's<00:01:03.610> where<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.879> tech<00:01:04.089> tree

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
strategy and that's where the tech tree

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.810 
strategy and that's where the tech tree
comes<00:01:04.479> in<00:01:04.690> we<00:01:05.110> can<00:01:05.229> go<00:01:05.320> in<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.830> we<00:01:06.340> can<00:01:06.520> take

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
comes in we can go in and we can take

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.910 
comes in we can go in and we can take
research<00:01:07.330> points<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.170> we've<00:01:08.350> accumulated

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
research points that we've accumulated

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.219 
research points that we've accumulated
from<00:01:09.400> combat<00:01:10.090> or<00:01:10.390> from<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.869> research

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
from combat or from the research

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.620 
from combat or from the research
structures<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:11.860> fill<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.759> we<00:01:12.909> can<00:01:13.060> unlock

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
structures we fill and we can unlock

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.179 
structures we fill and we can unlock
things<00:01:13.960> on<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.409> tree<00:01:14.649> and<00:01:14.799> we<00:01:14.920> can<00:01:15.039> make<00:01:15.159> a

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
things on the tree and we can make a

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.219 
things on the tree and we can make a
decision<00:01:15.700> how<00:01:15.969> do<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.359> want<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.689> go<00:01:16.810> after<00:01:17.020> our

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
decision how do we want to go after our

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.709 
decision how do we want to go after our
opponent<00:01:17.950> rather<00:01:18.310> than<00:01:18.640> spread<00:01:19.030> those<00:01:19.240> points

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
opponent rather than spread those points

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.529 
opponent rather than spread those points
equally<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:21.219> time<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:21.789> went<00:01:22.000> deep<00:01:22.329> that

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
equally this time we went deep that

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.480 
equally this time we went deep that
we've<00:01:22.689> unlocked<00:01:23.020> at<00:01:23.259> disruptor<00:01:23.710> station<00:01:24.130> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
we've unlocked at disruptor station the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.130 
we've unlocked at disruptor station the
long-range<00:01:24.820> artillery<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.810> then<00:01:25.899> we<00:01:26.020> get

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
long-range artillery and then we get

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.840 
long-range artillery and then we get
into<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.469> NOAA<00:01:26.649> unit<00:01:27.039> cannon

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
into the NOAA unit cannon

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.210 
into the NOAA unit cannon
one<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.119> my<00:01:28.180> favorites<00:01:28.630> now<00:01:29.350> considered<00:01:30.040> its

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
one of my favorites now considered its

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.429 
one of my favorites now considered its
croak<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:31.030> continue<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.869> hold<00:01:32.200> off<00:01:32.409> the

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
croak we continue to hold off the

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.770 
croak we continue to hold off the
opponent<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.939> found<00:01:34.420> them<00:01:34.659> with

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
opponent and we found them with

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.690 
opponent and we found them with
artillery<00:01:35.140> harassing<00:01:36.130> them<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.400> keeping

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
artillery harassing them and keeping

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.310 
artillery harassing them and keeping
them<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.119> their<00:01:37.360> toes<00:01:37.570> because<00:01:38.170> they're

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
them on their toes because they're

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.530 
them on their toes because they're
constantly<00:01:38.710> having<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.009> repair<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:40.360> just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
constantly having to repair and just

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.810 
constantly having to repair and just
maintain<00:01:41.020> their<00:01:41.229> base<00:01:41.409> maybe<00:01:42.310> they<00:01:42.520> start<00:01:42.729> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
maintain their base maybe they start to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.999 
maintain their base maybe they start to
build<00:01:43.000> shield<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.720> instead<00:01:44.590> we've<00:01:44.830> been

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
build shield and instead we've been

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.039 
build shield and instead we've been
filling<00:01:45.340> LIUNA<00:01:45.640> cannon<00:01:46.060> fully<00:01:46.270> units<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.840> are

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
filling LIUNA cannon fully units and are

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.020 
filling LIUNA cannon fully units and are
able<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.350> launch<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.100> all-out<00:01:48.460> offensive

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
able to launch this all-out offensive

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.899 
able to launch this all-out offensive
first<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:50.049> tear<00:01:50.289> up<00:01:50.409> their<00:01:50.560> base<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.190> then<00:01:51.789> we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
first we tear up their base and then we

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.690 
first we tear up their base and then we
drop<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:52.299> unit<00:01:52.539> cannon<00:01:53.020> units<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.159> make<00:01:54.670> a

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
drop the unit cannon units in and make a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240 
drop the unit cannon units in and make a
final<00:01:55.240> push<00:01:55.600> across<00:01:56.080> tearing<00:01:57.039> them<00:01:57.159> up

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
final push across tearing them up

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.310 
final push across tearing them up
catching<00:01:58.000> them<00:01:58.119> off<00:01:58.240> guard<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:59.080> kind<00:01:59.289> of
