closer look here on my home screen
you'll<00:00:43.090> notice<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.510> my<00:00:43.899> battery<00:00:44.140> symbol<00:00:44.680> as

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
you'll notice that my battery symbol as

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.830 
you'll notice that my battery symbol as
well<00:00:45.190> as<00:00:45.340> my<00:00:45.489> battery<00:00:45.879> percentage<00:00:46.149> is<00:00:46.600> not

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
well as my battery percentage is not

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.560 
well as my battery percentage is not
being<00:00:47.079> displayed<00:00:47.320> however<00:00:48.309> /<00:00:48.640> activation<00:00:49.360> let

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
being displayed however / activation let

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.340 
being displayed however / activation let
that<00:00:49.719> I<00:00:49.809> set<00:00:50.079> right<00:00:50.320> now<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:52.360> then<00:00:52.600> display

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
that I set right now I can then display

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.290 
that I set right now I can then display
quickly<00:00:53.890> what<00:00:54.039> my<00:00:54.160> battery<00:00:54.520> percentage<00:00:54.699> is

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
quickly what my battery percentage is

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.330 
quickly what my battery percentage is
and<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.660> achieve<00:00:56.050> this<00:00:56.350> with<00:00:56.739> two<00:00:57.070> different

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
and I achieve this with two different

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.270 
and I achieve this with two different
tweaks<00:00:57.789> one<00:00:58.629> being<00:00:58.870> bolts<00:00:59.410> which<00:00:59.680> hides<00:01:00.039> your

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
tweaks one being bolts which hides your

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.369 
tweaks one being bolts which hides your
battery<00:01:00.699> symbol<00:01:01.059> but<00:01:01.719> will<00:01:01.840> allow<00:01:02.079> you<00:01:02.140> to

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
battery symbol but will allow you to

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.109 
battery symbol but will allow you to
show<00:01:02.410> your<00:01:02.620> battery<00:01:03.129> percentage<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.910> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
show your battery percentage and the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.940 
show your battery percentage and the
other<00:01:04.330> one<00:01:04.629> being<00:01:04.809> battery<00:01:05.259> peak<00:01:05.619> which

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
other one being battery peak which

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.830 
other one being battery peak which
allows<00:01:06.280> you<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.759> show<00:01:07.240> your<00:01:07.450> battery

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
allows you to show your battery

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.050 
allows you to show your battery
percentage<00:01:08.049> per<00:01:08.619> activation<00:01:09.280> method<00:01:09.610> you<00:01:09.760> set

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
percentage per activation method you set

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.000 
percentage per activation method you set
so<00:01:10.390> right<00:01:10.659> now<00:01:10.689> I<00:01:10.960> have<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.439> so<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.890> my

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
so right now I have it so that my

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.219 
so right now I have it so that my
battery<00:01:12.220> percentage<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.939> not<00:01:13.150> showing<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.869> my

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
battery percentage is not showing and my

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.620 
battery percentage is not showing and my
symbol<00:01:15.159> for<00:01:15.369> my<00:01:15.670> battery<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.090> not<00:01:16.330> showing

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
symbol for my battery is not showing

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.679 
symbol for my battery is not showing
with<00:01:17.140> bolt<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.250> her<00:01:18.610> activation<00:01:19.270> method<00:01:19.600> I

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
with bolt but her activation method I

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.230 
with bolt but her activation method I
set<00:01:19.990> with<00:01:20.320> battery<00:01:20.830> peak<00:01:21.189> which<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.850> tap<00:01:22.030> in

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
set with battery peak which is to tap in

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.770 
set with battery peak which is to tap in
my<00:01:22.360> right<00:01:22.570> hand<00:01:22.600> corner<00:01:22.869> here<00:01:23.850> I'll<00:01:24.850> then<00:01:25.600> be

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
my right hand corner here I'll then be

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.359 
my right hand corner here I'll then be
able<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.140> see<00:01:26.350> quickly<00:01:26.590> what<00:01:26.920> my<00:01:27.040> battery

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
able to see quickly what my battery

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.520 
able to see quickly what my battery
percentage<00:01:27.610> is<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.659> there<00:01:28.840> are<00:01:29.049> just<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.500> few

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
percentage is so there are just a few

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.649 
percentage is so there are just a few
settings<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.340> configure<00:01:30.490> for<00:01:31.090> these<00:01:31.330> tweaks

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
settings to configure for these tweaks

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.920 
settings to configure for these tweaks
one<00:01:32.439> being<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:33.100> settings<00:01:33.610> for<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> bolt<00:01:34.299> where

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
one being in settings for a bolt where

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.800 
one being in settings for a bolt where
you<00:01:35.079> can<00:01:35.290> turn<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.740> toggle<00:01:36.189> offer<00:01:36.400> on<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.600> show

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
you can turn the toggle offer on to show

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.569 
you can turn the toggle offer on to show
the<00:01:37.990> battery<00:01:38.350> percent<00:01:38.829> so<00:01:39.159> say<00:01:39.369> for<00:01:39.400> instance

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
the battery percent so say for instance

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.249 
the battery percent so say for instance
you<00:01:39.970> just<00:01:40.180> wanted<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.479> percentage<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:41.049> show

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
you just wanted to percentage to show

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.410 
you just wanted to percentage to show
all<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.799> time<00:01:42.040> but<00:01:42.250> not<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.640> symbol<00:01:43.060> then<00:01:43.299> you

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
all the time but not the symbol then you

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.569 
all the time but not the symbol then you
would<00:01:43.540> flip<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:43.930> toggle<00:01:44.229> on<00:01:44.530> but<00:01:45.369> if<00:01:45.490> you
