your<00:01:33.180> plugins<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.409> we'll<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
your plugins and now we'll get to the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
your plugins and now we'll get to the
other<00:01:35.189> side<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.990> here

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
other side here this is right here

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
other side here this is right here
that's<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.680> port<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.369> PCI<00:01:38.729> Express

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that's your port for your PCI Express

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
that's your port for your PCI Express
six<00:01:39.659> slot<00:01:39.930> port<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.920> plug<00:01:41.100> in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
six slot port so that you can plug in

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
six slot port so that you can plug in
your<00:01:41.369> power<00:01:41.610> cable<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.930> these<00:01:43.140> four

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
your power cable to it now these four

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.830 
your power cable to it now these four
big<00:01:44.040> main<00:01:44.340> things<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.630> don't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
big main things right here you don't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.030 
big main things right here you don't
have<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> worry<00:01:46.290> about<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.890> much

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
have to worry about those as much

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
have to worry about those as much
because<00:01:47.220> those<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.759> for<00:01:47.939> your<00:01:48.060> power<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
because those are for your power and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
because those are for your power and
your<00:01:48.659> power<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.710> pretty<00:01:50.369> much<00:01:50.610> i'm<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.360> going

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
your power is pretty much i'm not going

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
your power is pretty much i'm not going
to<00:01:51.509> say<00:01:51.630> heat<00:01:51.840> free<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.439> its<00:01:52.590> heat<00:01:52.740> resistant

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
to say heat free but its heat resistant

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.749 
to say heat free but its heat resistant
so<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> any<00:01:55.200> extra<00:01:55.409> heat<00:01:55.649> sings<00:01:55.920> go

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so if you have any extra heat sings go

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
so if you have any extra heat sings go
ahead<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:56.969> put<00:01:57.180> those<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
ahead and put those on there just for

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
ahead and put those on there just for
good<00:01:58.259> measure<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.490> only<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.880> eight

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
good measure but if you only have eight

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.639 
good measure but if you only have eight
heat<00:02:00.360> sinks<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.200> i'm<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
heat sinks which is what i'm going to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.639 
heat sinks which is what i'm going to
get<00:02:01.799> with<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.100> VG<00:02:02.700> 1000<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:03.840> Zelman<00:02:04.259> you're

main thing in the middle here that has

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.520 
main thing in the middle here that has
this<00:02:21.190> really<00:02:21.520> gunky<00:02:22.210> looking<00:02:22.600> gray<00:02:23.140> stuff<00:02:23.380> in

this really gunky looking gray stuff in
the<00:02:23.590> middle<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.010> your<00:02:24.250> GPU<00:02:24.610> that's

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
the middle that is your GPU that's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.590 
the middle that is your GPU that's
pretty<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.890> central<00:02:27.820> processing<00:02:28.240> unit

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
pretty much your central processing unit

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.420 
pretty much your central processing unit
of<00:02:28.750> your<00:02:28.900> graphics<00:02:29.260> card<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.220> going

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
of your graphics card and that is going

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
of your graphics card and that is going
to<00:02:30.490> have<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.730> main<00:02:30.910> cooler<00:02:31.300> on<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.570> right

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to have the main cooler on it right

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.660 
to have the main cooler on it right
about<00:02:32.050> there<00:02:32.350> now<00:02:32.890> when<00:02:33.040> i'm<00:02:33.130> done<00:02:33.370> with<00:02:33.520> this

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
about there now when i'm done with this

about there now when i'm done with this
this<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.270> probably<00:02:34.450> take<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.870> about

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
this is going to probably take up about

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.980 
this is going to probably take up about
one<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.560> two<00:02:35.590> slots<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.490> my<00:02:37.120> bay<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.660> i<00:02:37.750> will<00:02:37.959> be
