then<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> real<00:00:38.370> struggle<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.790> dare

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
then on it was a real struggle I dare

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
then on it was a real struggle I dare
for<00:00:39.149> me<00:00:39.239> didn't<00:00:39.570> never<00:00:40.559> felt<00:00:40.770> comfortable

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
for me didn't never felt comfortable

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
for me didn't never felt comfortable
especially<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> second<00:00:42.180> session<00:00:42.329> never

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
especially in the second session never

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
especially in the second session never
felt<00:00:42.870> comfortable<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.379> all<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.950> just

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
felt comfortable at all and I just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
felt comfortable at all and I just
didn't<00:00:44.430> hit<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> ball<00:00:44.789> very<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
didn't hit the ball very well and it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.869 
didn't hit the ball very well and it
showed<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.309> didn't<00:00:47.309> score<00:00:47.579> any<00:00:47.610> where

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
showed because I didn't score any where

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.250 
showed because I didn't score any where
near<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> had<00:00:48.600> my<00:00:48.780> first<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.110> games

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
near the way I had my first two games

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.040 
near the way I had my first two games
and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.879> 10<00:00:50.879> best<00:00:51.000> 25<00:00:51.480> months<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and the 10 best 25 months you have to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.240 
and the 10 best 25 months you have to
have<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.350> all-around<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> think

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
have a good all-around game but I think

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.770 
have a good all-around game but I think
it's<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:53.760> come<00:00:53.910> down<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.090> score<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> though

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's gonna come down to score and though

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
it's gonna come down to score and though
they<00:00:54.930> engraved<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> bearer<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
they engraved on the bearer of it it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.979 
they engraved on the bearer of it it
seems<00:00:56.699> surprising<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.629> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
seems surprising as well because you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.389 
seems surprising as well because you
know<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> score<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.739> score<00:00:59.039> heavily

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
know when you score you score heavily

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
know when you score you score heavily
but<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> say<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> weren't<00:01:00.270> able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> find

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
but as you say you weren't able to find

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
but as you say you weren't able to find
that<00:01:00.870> consistency<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.739> will<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that consistency and so will you know it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.920 
that consistency and so will you know it
just<00:01:02.699> wasn't<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> ball<00:01:03.480> well<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
just wasn't time the ball well and the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
just wasn't time the ball well and the
table<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> beautiful<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.739> Darren<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
table is beautiful I Darren was just

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
table is beautiful I Darren was just
that<00:01:05.670> short<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.360> suit<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.080> bought<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.530> timing

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that short a suit I bought it was timing

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
that short a suit I bought it was timing
it<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.280> struggling<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> screw

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it because I was struggling to screw

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880 
it because I was struggling to screw
back<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> everything<00:01:10.290> sort<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> went<00:01:10.710> wrong

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
back and everything sort of went wrong

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.440 
back and everything sort of went wrong
really<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.189> don't<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> didn't

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really I don't as I say I just didn't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.719 
really I don't as I say I just didn't
feel<00:01:12.600> comfortable<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.409> never<00:01:14.250> felt<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
feel comfortable and I never felt that I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
feel comfortable and I never felt that I
was<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> produce<00:01:15.240> any<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.750> sniper<00:01:15.990> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
was going to produce any good sniper but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
was going to produce any good sniper but
I<00:01:16.409> battled<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.909> I've<00:01:18.000> learned

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
I battled and that's what I've learned

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
I battled and that's what I've learned
to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.420> over<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> last<00:01:18.750> few<00:01:18.990> years<00:01:19.049> maybe<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to do over the last few years maybe a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.820 
to do over the last few years maybe a
few<00:01:20.310> years<00:01:20.400> ago<00:01:20.580> over<00:01:20.850> lost<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.509> much

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
few years ago over lost that much

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
few years ago over lost that much
comfortably<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.540> I'm<00:01:24.540> happy<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.900> myself

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
comfortably and I'm happy with myself

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
comfortably and I'm happy with myself
the<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.470> dug<00:01:25.650> deep<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> sort<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.460> find
