 Hi all of me from Reflection Nirvana, 

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.099
 This time I will share Manicure Tips at Home. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.166
 This time I will share Manicure Tips at Home. 

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:15.132
 Many people often ignore nail care. 

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.433
 Usually people just simply cut and trim their nails 

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.533
 without taking care of nail health. 

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:29.866
 Though nails need to be considered so that they are not easily brittle and moldy. 

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.632
 So, it is very important to enjoy the benefits of manicure 

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.699
 either by doing at home or at a beauty salon. 

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.232
 There are several Manicure Tips at Home, including: 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:55.066
 1. Make sure the nails don't use nail polish. If you still use it, remove it with nail polish remover. 

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:02.266
 2. Rub the nails with lemon for 5-10 minutes. 

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:08.966
 3. Soak hands in a basin that has been filled with warm water. 

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:14.332
 Add a little salt, liquid soap, lemon slices and olive oil. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.266
 4. Wipe one hand with a towel. 

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:25.732
 5. Cut the nails and discard the cuticles with cuticle scissors. 

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:31.799
 6. Soak hands in cold water. 

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:37.766
 7. Afterwards, dry your hands. Use hand lotion. 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.233
 8. Apply nails with a base coat. Wait for it to dry, then apply it with nail polish.
