 is actually quite different 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.110
 blatant of league of legends what the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.150
 as a game, briefly summarized 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 the dots just mean you are always nice 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.049

 a sensible webcam vernes and sets 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.040
 the first priority is the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.290
 defense of your base 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.110
 then come the camps then come the 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.299
 other objectives and then entirely to the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 Finally comes the kill of 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.719
 enemy heroes and who still 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.450

 heroes of the storm just for your own death 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.960
 leads and not to the death of the guitarist 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.670
