00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.819
 I think if we talk again 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.250
 of penalties with removes merit of our 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.160
 games all our efforts today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 no then no no no no I will not be there 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'm going to talk about the effort that has 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 made our team of tranquility 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.670
 that since we knew how to have at the time 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 punctual that was with the music hub the goal 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.500
 and I thought that the evolution of our 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.060
 group as a team is fantastic 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.320
 we need to improve the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.270
 back I thought that today 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.010
 they had a lot of game because 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.010
 our line was a little and separated 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.960
 but I thought that to be a great 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.430
 team there is to be wrong to 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.379
 to be able to grow like knowing then a 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.420
 better brazil give and of course this is 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.010
 the world cup with the passing of the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.230
 you have to go back because if you do not 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 you're going to be on the right path alone 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.110
 for the color of the good people of 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.060
 Ecuador 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.410
 this brazil is the best believe they are going to 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.660
 improve a lot we will improve a lot 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:06.010
 I'm going to do the game with a lot 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.180
 much attention much fire but we have 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.130
 much to improve 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.650
 I like that the cup the world is here 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.280
 in brazil what do you think of that is very 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.280
 good for 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.270
 for people who are from Brazil for 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.110
 who can know what Brazil can 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.200
 You can have a world cup that the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.670
 country I do not think that people are very 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.990
 where proud to be the hardest 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.570
 group and acro is going to be the hardest 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.390
 group tone and world cup there is no 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.890
 team that better than the other harder me 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 I think that the next game is always going to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.990
 be harder now we have to think about 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.880
 mexico mexico is going to be very hard mind 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.670
 what it feels like to start with two goals how 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.500
 you feel like you start with two goals and two 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.990
 goals for 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.870
 I am very happy for the two goals 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.630
 the victory we started very well happy 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.170
 for Brazil as a country also clear 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.320
 Algiers fiction today very important for 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.320
 we 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.920
 at the end and I hope 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 continue like this
