00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the skin and then chop it finely because

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.479 
the skin and then chop it finely because
we<00:00:57.270> need<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> grind<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.199> paste<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
we need to grind it into a paste so it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
we need to grind it into a paste so it
will<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.730> easier<00:01:00.090> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> soak<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> overnight

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
will be easier if you soak it overnight

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.049 
will be easier if you soak it overnight
so<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> skin<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.800> removed<00:01:02.190> easily<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.879> use

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so the skin can be removed easily we use

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
so the skin can be removed easily we use
a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.629> milk<00:01:03.809> from<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> cup<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
write the elements into a fine paste

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.830 
write the elements into a fine paste
don't<00:01:07.979> add<00:01:08.280> any<00:01:08.640> water<00:01:08.910> you<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.630> add<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
don't add any water you just add a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
little bit of weight and grind it nice

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.960 
little bit of weight and grind it nice
and<00:01:12.030> fine<00:01:12.679> now<00:01:13.679> the<00:01:13.740> almond<00:01:14.429> paste<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.940> ready

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and fine now the almond paste is ready

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.380 
and fine now the almond paste is ready
so<00:01:15.600> ground<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.350> almonds<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:18.119> one

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
so ground these almonds with about one

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
so ground these almonds with about one
and<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.600> half<00:01:18.750> cups<00:01:19.050> of<00:01:19.200> milk<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.580> rest<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
and a half cups of milk and the rest of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.480 
and a half cups of milk and the rest of
the<00:01:21.420> milk<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.590> while<00:01:23.160> preparing

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the milk I will use it while preparing

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
the milk I will use it while preparing
the<00:01:23.759> halwa<00:01:24.060> first<00:01:25.050> you<00:01:25.350> add<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.800> lead<00:01:30.799> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the halwa first you add the lead so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.300 
the halwa first you add the lead so
after<00:01:32.100> adding<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.549> ghee<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.060> add<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> paste

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
after adding the ghee you add the paste

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.179 
after adding the ghee you add the paste
slowly<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.049> fry<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> paste<00:01:37.680> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
slowly so we need to fry the paste in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:02:05.830 
slowly so we need to fry the paste in
the<00:01:38.340> ghee<00:01:38.520> till<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.299> become<00:01:40.520> golden<00:01:41.520> color

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.330 

so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> need<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> fry<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.439> paste<00:02:07.740> in<00:02:07.979> medium

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so you need to fry the paste in medium

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.789 
so you need to fry the paste in medium
heat<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.910> keep<00:02:09.299> stirring<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.959> on<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.560> so

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
heat and keep stirring it on there so

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.390 
heat and keep stirring it on there so
that<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.580> doesn't<00:02:11.610> stick<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.420> kadai<00:02:13.400> so

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
that it doesn't stick to the kadai so

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.270 
that it doesn't stick to the kadai so
you<00:02:14.489> preferably<00:02:14.849> use<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> nonstick<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.440> it's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you preferably use a nonstick so it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.949 
you preferably use a nonstick so it's
safe<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.970> way<00:02:20.420> now<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.720> see<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
safe for that way now you can see the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.600 
safe for that way now you can see the
color<00:02:22.170> has<00:02:22.349> changed<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:23.069> little<00:02:23.310> bit

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.000 

now<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> album<00:02:28.560> faces

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
now you can see that the album faces

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.520 
now you can see that the album faces
started<00:02:29.520> slightly<00:02:30.090> golden<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.750> color<00:02:30.960> it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
started slightly golden in color it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.500 
started slightly golden in color it's
now<00:02:31.710> would<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.550> time<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.150> add<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
now would be a good time to add the

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.390 
now would be a good time to add the
sugar

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.480 

along<00:02:37.400> with<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.730> milk

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.630 

so<00:02:43.150> keep<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.690> flame<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.350> medium<00:02:44.920> low<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.340> keep

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
so keep the flame in medium low and keep

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.730 
so keep the flame in medium low and keep
mixing<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.210> till<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.320> moisture

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
mixing it till all the moisture

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:57.900 
mixing it till all the moisture
evaporates<00:02:55.350> now<00:02:56.350> that's<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.250> carbon<00:02:57.520> powder

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
evaporates now that's a carbon powder

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.400 
evaporates now that's a carbon powder
for<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.510> teaspoon<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.570> want<00:03:04.810> P<00:03:05.050> above

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
for a teaspoon if you do want P above

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.750 
for a teaspoon if you do want P above
them<00:03:05.560> halwa<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> look<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.370> little<00:03:06.490> more

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
them halwa to look a little more
