against a very good defensive team we

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.969 
against a very good defensive team we
have<00:01:51.659> been<00:01:51.869> able<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.200> simulate<00:01:52.410> that<00:01:52.650> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
have been able to simulate that in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.690 
have been able to simulate that in
practice<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.660> showed<00:01:54.900> up<00:01:55.080> today<00:01:55.700> because

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
that it did and all that smart stuff but

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.699 
that it did and all that smart stuff but
the<00:02:49.360> truth<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.989> matter<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.500> thought

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the truth to the matter is I thought

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.710 
the truth to the matter is I thought
that<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:51.010> would<00:02:51.159> rise<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> challenge<00:02:52.659> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
that we would rise to the challenge and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.710 
that we would rise to the challenge and
we<00:02:52.870> needed<00:02:53.079> to<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.560> mean<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.879> four<00:02:55.450> or<00:02:55.569> five

guys on this team it was on the team two
years<00:02:57.670> ago<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.060> they<00:02:58.120> beat<00:02:58.299> us<00:02:58.329> by<00:02:58.510> 88<00:02:58.930> or

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.360 
was concerned about it but I thought
that<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:11.409> head<00:03:11.709> coach<00:03:11.950> would<00:03:12.159> do<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> better

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that the head coach would do a better

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.099 
that the head coach would do a better
job<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.090> our<00:03:13.180> guys<00:03:13.359> more<00:03:13.599> ready<00:03:13.870> than<00:03:13.959> I
