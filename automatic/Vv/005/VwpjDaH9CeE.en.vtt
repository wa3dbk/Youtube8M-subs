maybe<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.600> evil<00:04:07.810> spawn<00:04:08.080> comes<00:04:08.920> with<00:04:09.070> a

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
maybe the evil spawn comes with a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.550 
maybe the evil spawn comes with a
removable<00:04:09.640> cape<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:10.810> are<00:04:10.930> able<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.290> take

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
removable cape that you are able to take

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.530 
removable cape that you are able to take
off<00:04:11.769> whenever<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.459> want<00:04:12.580> his<00:04:13.239> articulation

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
off whenever you want his articulation

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.819 
off whenever you want his articulation
is<00:04:14.110> exactly<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.739> same<00:04:14.950> as<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.610> other<00:04:15.700> spawn

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
is exactly the same as the other spawn

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.979 
is exactly the same as the other spawn
so<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:18.669> would<00:04:18.880> make<00:04:19.060> sense<00:04:19.299> because<00:04:19.540> they<00:04:19.900> are

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
so it would make sense because they are

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.840 
so it would make sense because they are
both<00:04:20.200> spawn<00:04:20.500> characters<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.400> they<00:04:21.579> are<00:04:21.640> both

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
both spawn characters and they are both

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.610 
both spawn characters and they are both
