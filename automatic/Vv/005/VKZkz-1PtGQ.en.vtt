00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.390 
and here's just a little hemp helpful
hint<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.990> get<00:00:07.140> them<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.700> just<00:00:08.700> slip<00:00:10.219> slip<00:00:11.219> on

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
hint to get them on just slip slip on

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.419 
hint to get them on just slip slip on
over<00:00:11.429> but<00:00:12.000> they're<00:00:12.330> actually<00:00:12.950> pretty<00:00:13.950> tricky

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
over but they're actually pretty tricky

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.060 
over but they're actually pretty tricky
to<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:17.690> they<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> look<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:19.949> bit

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
to get on they take a look a little bit

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.269 
to get on they take a look a little bit
of<00:00:20.189> work<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.550> sometimes<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.680> easier<00:00:22.680> if<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
of work and sometimes it's easier if you

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
of work and sometimes it's easier if you
take<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> tighter<00:00:23.910> off<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:26.810> that's<00:00:27.810> kind<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
take the tighter off but that's kind of

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
take the tighter off but that's kind of
a<00:00:28.680> pain<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.250> you're<00:00:30.179> taking<00:00:30.570> them<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
a pain when you're taking them on and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.569 
a pain when you're taking them on and
off<00:00:31.489> which<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.640> also<00:00:32.850> suggest<00:00:34.460> taking<00:00:35.460> these

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
off which I also suggest taking these

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.330 
off which I also suggest taking these
off<00:00:35.960> for<00:00:36.960> storage<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:37.920> like

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
off for storage just so you don't like

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
off for storage just so you don't like
completely<00:00:38.910> screw<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.570> your<00:00:39.719> foams<00:00:39.960> because

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
completely screw up your foams because

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.139 
completely screw up your foams because
it<00:00:40.920> does<00:00:41.989> compress<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.140> phones<00:00:43.410> pretty

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
it does compress your phones pretty

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.750 
it does compress your phones pretty
tight<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.420> those<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:48.590> deteriorate<00:00:49.760> pretty

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
tight and those will deteriorate pretty

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.889 
tight and those will deteriorate pretty
fast<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:52.289> keep<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:53.239> for<00:00:54.239> long

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
fast if you keep them on for long

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.029 
fast if you keep them on for long
periods<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> time<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.620> little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
periods of time so a little bit of a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
periods of time so a little bit of a
helpful<00:00:59.309> hemp<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> inside

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
helpful hemp is if you get the inside

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.030 
helpful hemp is if you get the inside
wet<00:01:01.579> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> lightly<00:01:03.660> rinse<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.229> goes<00:01:04.860> on

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
wet if you just lightly rinse it goes on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.039 
wet if you just lightly rinse it goes on
a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.339> bit<00:01:05.519> easier<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.630> tires<00:01:06.869> are

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
a little bit easier or if your tires are

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
a little bit easier or if your tires are
a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.380> wet<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:08.909> crucial

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a little bit wet but that's not crucial

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770 
a little bit wet but that's not crucial
and<00:01:10.070> they<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.310> wear<00:01:11.580> I've<00:01:12.180> ran<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.750> a

and they will wear I've ran these a
couple<00:01:13.020> times<00:01:13.200> already<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.090> they<00:01:15.090> actually

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
couple times already but they actually

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
couple times already but they actually
they<00:01:15.900> seem<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.229> hold<00:01:16.350> up<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.820> how

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
they seem to hold up pretty well for how

I<00:02:43.420> did<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:44.110> mod<00:02:44.379> because<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
I did this little mod because you you

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.839 
I did this little mod because you you
can<00:02:47.049> drift<00:02:47.379> with<00:02:47.650> what's<00:02:48.160> saving<00:02:48.519> your<00:02:48.640> tires

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
can drift with what's saving your tires

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.240 
can drift with what's saving your tires
a<00:02:48.970> little<00:02:49.060> more<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.709> don't<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.130> be

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
a little more and you don't have to be

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.839 
a little more and you don't have to be
just<00:02:51.579> in<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.790> winter<00:02:52.120> on<00:02:52.299> ice<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.819> what<00:02:54.819> I

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
just in the winter on ice and what I

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.100 
just in the winter on ice and what I
like<00:02:55.060> about<00:02:55.090> these<00:02:55.480> tires<00:02:55.690> where<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> was<00:02:56.079> a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
like about these tires where I was a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.000 
like about these tires where I was a
little<00:02:56.170> bit<00:02:56.410> worried<00:02:56.680> about<00:02:56.739> when<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.980> first

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
little bit worried about when I first

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.009 
little bit worried about when I first
got<00:02:57.430> them<00:02:57.610> is<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.540> they<00:02:58.720> wouldn't<00:02:58.959> have

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
got them is that that they wouldn't have

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.229 
got them is that that they wouldn't have
enough<00:02:59.769> traction<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.489> all<00:03:00.670> they<00:03:00.849> would<00:03:01.000> do<00:03:01.120> is

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
enough traction and all they would do is

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.390 
enough traction and all they would do is
just<00:03:01.269> go<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.660> circles<00:03:01.690> but<00:03:02.260> actually<00:03:03.040> with<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
just go in circles but actually with you

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640 
just go in circles but actually with you
know<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.700> four-wheel<00:03:04.090> drive<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:05.140> really

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
know the four-wheel drive it it really

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.460 
know the four-wheel drive it it really
you<00:03:06.310> know<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.610> does<00:03:07.120> some<00:03:07.329> really<00:03:07.750> nice<00:03:08.110> good

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
you know it does some really nice good

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.830 
you know it does some really nice good
controlled<00:03:08.950> drifts<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
controlled drifts and

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.259 
controlled drifts and
I'll<00:03:11.110> show<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:12.010> second<00:03:12.459> out<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
I'll show that in a second out on the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.390 
I'll show that in a second out on the
road<00:03:13.510> but<00:03:14.440> if<00:03:14.650> you're<00:03:14.799> looking<00:03:15.069> into<00:03:15.310> getting

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
road but if you're looking into getting

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.390 
road but if you're looking into getting
into<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.450> bit<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.660> drifting<00:03:17.079> on<00:03:17.400> you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
into a little bit of drifting on you

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.949 
into a little bit of drifting on you
know<00:03:18.489> pretty<00:03:18.700> much<00:03:18.760> any<00:03:19.030> RC<00:03:19.360> car<00:03:19.569> all<00:03:19.750> that

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
know pretty much any RC car all that

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.530 
know pretty much any RC car all that
matters<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.500> your<00:03:21.130> PVC<00:03:21.489> fits<00:03:21.940> tightly

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
matters is that your PVC fits tightly

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.199 
matters is that your PVC fits tightly
over<00:03:22.780> your<00:03:22.930> tires<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.470> if<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:24.160> when<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.060> go

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
over your tires so if you when you go

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.990 
over your tires so if you when you go
and<00:03:25.359> buy<00:03:25.420> your<00:03:25.780> PVC<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.620> suggest<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.220> taking

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
and buy your PVC I suggest just taking

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.430 
and buy your PVC I suggest just taking
one<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.269> wheels<00:03:28.450> with<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.350> know

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
one of the wheels with you and you know

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680 
one of the wheels with you and you know
seeing<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.040> snug<00:03:30.280> fit<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:31.239> other<00:03:31.510> than

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
seeing if it's a snug fit but other than

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.539 
seeing if it's a snug fit but other than
that<00:03:31.780> no<00:03:32.139> I<00:03:32.170> think<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.799> great<00:03:33.040> mod<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
that no I think this is a great mod and

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.150 
that no I think this is a great mod and
I<00:03:34.239> would<00:03:34.450> highly<00:03:34.810> recommend<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.380> if<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.980> you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
I would highly recommend it if if you

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.039 
I would highly recommend it if if you
don't<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.790> drift<00:03:37.090> car<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.660> want<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
don't have a drift car but you want to

00:03:38.049 --> 00:04:46.590 
don't have a drift car but you want to
get<00:03:38.200> into<00:03:38.349> some<00:03:38.650> drifting

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.840 

so<00:04:47.600> overall<00:04:48.229> if<00:04:48.590> you're<00:04:48.860> looking<00:04:48.919> into<00:04:49.460> get

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
so overall if you're looking into get

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.480 
so overall if you're looking into get
into<00:04:50.180> some<00:04:50.479> cheap<00:04:51.080> RC<00:04:51.680> drifting<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.310> you're

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
into some cheap RC drifting and you're

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.670 
into some cheap RC drifting and you're
on<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.639> budget<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.240> you<00:04:53.330> don't<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.500> money

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
on a budget and you don't have the money

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.850 
on a budget and you don't have the money
to<00:04:54.800> buy<00:04:55.070> a<00:04:55.370> whole<00:04:55.610> new<00:04:55.639> drifting<00:04:56.570> RC<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.199> would

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
to buy a whole new drifting RC I would

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.790 
to buy a whole new drifting RC I would
highly<00:04:58.400> recommend<00:04:58.910> my<00:04:59.060> PVC<00:04:59.479> drip<00:04:59.930> tires<00:05:00.169> to

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
highly recommend my PVC drip tires to

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.030 
highly recommend my PVC drip tires to
anyone<00:05:01.220> that<00:05:01.490> can<00:05:02.000> figure<00:05:02.930> out<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.560> their

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
anyone that can figure out if their

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.210 
anyone that can figure out if their
tires<00:05:04.520> will<00:05:05.210> fit<00:05:05.479> these<00:05:06.169> tires<00:05:06.590> are<00:05:06.740> great<00:05:06.979> and

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
tires will fit these tires are great and

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.490 
tires will fit these tires are great and
the<00:05:07.850> best<00:05:08.060> part<00:05:08.300> about<00:05:08.360> them<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:09.470> can

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
the best part about them is you can

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.590 
the best part about them is you can
really<00:05:10.100> just<00:05:10.729> drive<00:05:11.000> them<00:05:11.150> again

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
really just drive them again

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.390 
really just drive them again
and<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.410> don't<00:05:12.590> have<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.860> buy<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.040> through

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
and you don't have to buy it through

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.790 
and you don't have to buy it through
full
