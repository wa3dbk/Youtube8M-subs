00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
can see for yourself which notes I have

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.789

which ones I don't my organization is

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.919 
which ones I don't my organization is
pretty<00:00:13.920> unique<00:00:14.190> though<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:15.000> found<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.780> best

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
pretty unique though I found the best

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.260 
pretty unique though I found the best
way<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.139> organize<00:00:16.320> them<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.160> put<00:00:17.340> them<00:00:17.520> by

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
way to organize them is to put them by

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
way to organize them is to put them by
year<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> then<00:00:19.080> alphabetically<00:00:19.710> by<00:00:19.800> each

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
year and then alphabetically by each

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.620 
year and then alphabetically by each
year<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> next<00:00:21.090> year<00:00:21.240> comes<00:00:21.449> out

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
year so when the next year comes out

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.920 
year so when the next year comes out

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
535 out of 584 which is 91% I'm missing

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
535 out of 584 which is 91% I'm missing
49<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.420> total<00:00:57.690> though<00:00:57.899> 584<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.890> not

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
49 and that's my total though 584 is not

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
49 and that's my total though 584 is not
the<00:00:59.789> exact<00:01:00.090> number<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> might<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.649> it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the exact number it might be but it's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.579 
the exact number it might be but it's
probably<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.780> no<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.110> knows<00:01:04.320> what

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
probably not no one really knows what

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
probably not no one really knows what
the<00:01:04.710> exact<00:01:04.979> number<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.250> though<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.659> different

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the exact number is though so different

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
the exact number is though so different
people<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.140> different<00:01:07.170> totals<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.369> are

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
people have different totals that are

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.510 
people have different totals that are
completionists<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.930> call<00:01:10.170> me

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
completionists they call me

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
minifigures so they have no empty spaces

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.039 
minifigures so they have no empty spaces
for<00:01:28.049> example<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> gungun<00:01:29.430> soldier

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
for example up here the gungun soldier

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.420 
for example up here the gungun soldier
right<00:01:31.049> before<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.979> should<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.189> two

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
right before that there should be two

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
right before that there should be two
members<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.720> black<00:01:33.869> hands<00:01:34.110> one

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

with<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> yellow<00:01:34.619> hands<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:36.990> an

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
with the yellow hands so that's just an

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.319 
with the yellow hands so that's just an
example<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.890> black<00:01:38.130> space<00:01:38.340> which<00:01:39.150> I'm

was<00:02:09.780> worth<00:02:09.989> before<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> next<00:02:11.790> minifigure

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239

head right there so that's a variant and
the<00:04:52.260> ones<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.770> showed<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:52.980> are<00:04:53.160> also

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
the ones I just showed you are also

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.430 
the ones I just showed you are also
variants<00:04:53.850> except<00:04:54.510> for<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> different<00:04:55.020> type

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
variants except for a different type

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.670 
variants except for a different type
so<00:04:56.360> minifigs<00:04:57.360> dot<00:04:57.540> NL<00:04:57.930> is<00:04:58.140> also<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.440> great

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
so minifigs dot NL is also a great

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.980 
so minifigs dot NL is also a great
website<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.190> find<00:04:59.490> those<00:04:59.700> variants<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
website to find those variants and you

consider<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.500> be<00:05:13.620> many<00:05:13.830> things<00:05:13.890> because<00:05:14.190> they

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
consider to be many things because they

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.010 
consider to be many things because they
have<00:05:14.370> metal<00:05:14.640> in<00:05:14.730> them<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.750> they're<00:05:15.870> glued

collect<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:18.630> this<00:05:19.050> is<00:05:19.290> probably<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.220> best

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
collect but this is probably the best

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.610 
collect but this is probably the best
way<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.730> display<00:05:21.270> them<00:05:21.480> not<00:05:22.140> the<00:05:22.290> best<00:05:22.470> way<00:05:22.590> to

way to display them not the best way to

way to display them not the best way to
display<00:05:22.920> them<00:05:23.100> but<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.370> best<00:05:23.520> way<00:05:23.730> to

display them but the best way to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.180 
display them but the best way to
organize<00:05:24.120> them<00:05:24.570> which<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.140> better<00:05:25.320> word

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
organize them which is a better word

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.410 
organize them which is a better word
I<00:05:26.420> have<00:05:27.420> blank<00:05:27.750> spaces<00:05:27.990> as<00:05:28.260> you<00:05:28.440> can<00:05:28.560> see<00:05:28.800> and

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
I have blank spaces as you can see and

I have blank spaces as you can see and
just<00:05:30.420> to<00:05:30.540> point<00:05:30.720> out<00:05:30.840> this<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.080> pretty

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
just to point out this is pretty

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.960 
just to point out this is pretty
important<00:05:31.860> that<00:05:31.950> every<00:05:32.250> single<00:05:32.460> minifigure

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
important that every single minifigure

important that every single minifigure
on<00:05:33.120> my<00:05:33.360> three<00:05:34.080> shelves<00:05:34.320> is<00:05:34.560> different<00:05:35.310> not<00:05:35.820> one

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
on my three shelves is different not one

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.270 
on my three shelves is different not one
is<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.210> same<00:05:36.450> but<00:05:37.140> if<00:05:37.290> I<00:05:37.410> were<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.680> add<00:05:37.800> all<00:05:38.130> of

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
is the same but if I were to add all of

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.980 
is the same but if I were to add all of
the<00:05:38.370> ones<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.730> I<00:05:38.760> have<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.300> are<00:05:39.480> different

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
the ones that I have that are different

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.290 
the ones that I have that are different
that<00:05:40.290> are<00:05:40.830> not<00:05:41.160> different<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.670> are<00:05:41.760> doubles

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
that are not different that are doubles

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.570 
that are not different that are doubles
such<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:43.020> battle<00:05:43.620> droids<00:05:43.830> and<00:05:43.980> clone<00:05:44.130> tubers<00:05:44.490> I

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
such as battle droids and clone tubers I

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.970 
such as battle droids and clone tubers I
would<00:05:44.700> have<00:05:44.790> about<00:05:44.910> 650<00:05:45.690> minifigures<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.860> that

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
would have about 650 minifigures so that

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.950 
would have about 650 minifigures so that
is<00:05:47.100> not<00:05:47.250> part<00:05:47.490> of<00:05:47.520> my<00:05:47.580> total<00:05:47.940> only<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.780> ones

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
is not part of my total only the ones

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.670 
is not part of my total only the ones
that<00:05:49.050> are<00:05:49.200> different<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.210> variants<00:05:51.210> if<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:52.110> have

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
that are different so variants if I have

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.230 
that are different so variants if I have
all<00:05:52.800> my<00:05:52.830> variants<00:05:53.310> out<00:05:53.430> here<00:05:53.610> if<00:05:53.700> I<00:05:53.760> had<00:05:53.880> one<00:05:54.120> of

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
all my variants out here if I had one of

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.940 
all my variants out here if I had one of
every<00:05:54.420> minifigure<00:05:54.900> which<00:05:55.290> a<00:05:55.440> lot<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.740> people

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
every minifigure which a lot of people

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.800 
every minifigure which a lot of people
do<00:05:56.070> they'll<00:05:56.460> put<00:05:56.670> one<00:05:56.700> Anakin<00:05:57.240> out<00:05:57.360> there<00:05:57.600> and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
do they'll put one Anakin out there and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.990 
do they'll put one Anakin out there and
that's<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.860> because<00:05:59.400> he's<00:05:59.670> a<00:05:59.700> single

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
that's it because he's a single

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.650 
that's it because he's a single
character<00:06:00.510> I<00:06:01.220> would<00:06:02.220> probably<00:06:02.700> have<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.300> few

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
character I would probably have a few

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.480 
character I would probably have a few
hundred<00:06:04.020> less<00:06:04.230> maybe<00:06:05.010> even<00:06:05.280> three<00:06:05.460> hundred

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
hundred less maybe even three hundred

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.660 
hundred less maybe even three hundred
less<00:06:05.910> because<00:06:06.600> there<00:06:06.720> are<00:06:06.810> so<00:06:07.020> many<00:06:07.080> variants

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
less because there are so many variants

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.250 
less because there are so many variants
I'd<00:06:08.670> say<00:06:08.850> Lego<00:06:09.120> Star<00:06:09.420> Wars<00:06:09.600> is<00:06:09.720> the<00:06:09.810> best<00:06:10.080> way

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
I'd say Lego Star Wars is the best way

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.810 
I'd say Lego Star Wars is the best way
to<00:06:10.290> collect<00:06:10.530> Star<00:06:10.860> Wars<00:06:11.040> items<00:06:11.400> in<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.610> first

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
to collect Star Wars items in the first

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.850 
to collect Star Wars items in the first
place<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.420> can<00:06:12.540> get<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.720> lot<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.080> a<00:06:13.500> lot<00:06:13.740> of

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
place you can get a lot of a lot of

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.010 
place you can get a lot of a lot of
different<00:06:14.130> sets<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.580> a<00:06:15.570> lot<00:06:15.870> of<00:06:15.900> different

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
different sets and a lot of different

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.100 
different sets and a lot of different
minifigures<00:06:16.650> obviously<00:06:17.160> as<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.340> can<00:06:17.400> see<00:06:17.670> and

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
minifigures obviously as you can see and

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.490 
minifigures obviously as you can see and
the<00:06:19.110> minifigures<00:06:19.650> are<00:06:20.060> great<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.240> collect<00:06:21.500> it

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
the minifigures are great to collect it

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.640 
the minifigures are great to collect it
gives<00:06:22.740> you<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:23.130> lot<00:06:23.760> of<00:06:24.060> options<00:06:24.990> to<00:06:25.110> collect

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
gives you a lot of options to collect

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.060 
gives you a lot of options to collect
them<00:06:26.420> as<00:06:27.420> you<00:06:27.720> can<00:06:27.840> see<00:06:27.990> in<00:06:28.230> the<00:06:28.350> back<00:06:28.560> I<00:06:28.830> have

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
them as you can see in the back I have

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.860 
them as you can see in the back I have
some<00:06:29.340> poly<00:06:29.520> bags<00:06:29.790> only<00:06:30.000> one<00:06:30.240> has<00:06:30.390> a<00:06:30.420> minifigure

some poly bags only one has a minifigure
in<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.170> the<00:06:31.350> silver<00:06:31.680> storm<00:06:31.950> trooper<00:06:32.220> I<00:06:32.400> didn't

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940

in it the silver storm trooper I didn't
show<00:06:33.060> you<00:06:33.150> that<00:06:33.180> one<00:06:33.360> on<00:06:33.480> my<00:06:33.540> shelf<00:06:33.810> earlier

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
show you that one on my shelf earlier

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.650 
show you that one on my shelf earlier
right<00:06:34.800> there<00:06:34.980> you<00:06:35.070> can<00:06:35.160> see<00:06:35.310> it's<00:06:35.430> shiny<00:06:35.669> I<00:06:35.940> did

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
right there you can see it's shiny I did

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.030 
right there you can see it's shiny I did
not<00:06:36.780> show<00:06:36.930> that<00:06:37.080> one<00:06:37.200> before<00:06:37.530> when<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.710> put<00:06:38.010> out
