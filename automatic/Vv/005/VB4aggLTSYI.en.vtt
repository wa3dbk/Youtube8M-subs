handlebars unfortunately you're actually
pretty<00:00:13.380> easy<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.769> fix<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.400> trail<00:00:14.700> all

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
pretty easy to fix out on the trail all

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.910 
pretty easy to fix out on the trail all
you<00:00:15.210> got<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> chain<00:00:16.500> tool<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
you got to have is a chain tool and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.609 
you got to have is a chain tool and
here's<00:00:17.369> how<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.550> use<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.140> then<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.199> got<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> chain

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
here's how to use it then I got a chain

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.540 
here's how to use it then I got a chain
-<00:00:19.740> ah<00:00:19.830> good<00:00:19.980> boy<00:00:21.769> now<00:00:22.769> no<00:00:22.949> seriousness<00:00:23.279> you

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
- ah good boy now no seriousness you

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.700 
- ah good boy now no seriousness you
should<00:00:23.789> always<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.689> chain<00:00:25.230> tool<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
should always have a chain tool with you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
should always have a chain tool with you
on<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.039> ride<00:00:26.340> where<00:00:26.939> you're<00:00:27.060> further<00:00:27.330> than

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
on any ride where you're further than

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
on any ride where you're further than
walking<00:00:27.990> distance<00:00:28.410> away<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.340> car<00:00:29.580> or

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
walking distance away from your car or

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
walking distance away from your car or
your<00:00:30.119> house<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.890> part<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
your house so this is just part of a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.920 
your house so this is just part of a
multi-tool<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.360> will<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.600> job<00:00:33.719> just

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
multi-tool and it will do the job just

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.709 
multi-tool and it will do the job just
nicely<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:35.460> hopefully<00:00:35.910> where<00:00:36.149> your<00:00:36.270> chain<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
nicely now hopefully where your chain is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.840 
nicely now hopefully where your chain is
broken<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.890> link<00:00:38.579> that's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
broken it's just one link that's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
broken it's just one link that's
affected<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> might<00:00:39.840> find<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
affected but you might find that

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440 
affected but you might find that
actually<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> chain<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.550> twisted<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.239> all

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
actually if the chain is twisted at all

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.229 
actually if the chain is twisted at all
then<00:00:43.230> there'll<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.040> several<00:00:44.430> links<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.120> are

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
then there'll be several links that are

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:45.740 
then there'll be several links that are
bent

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
bent

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
bent
whichever<00:00:46.530> case<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
whichever case it is you're going to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
whichever case it is you're going to
have<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> remove<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.510> damaged<00:00:48.870> links

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
have to remove the damaged links

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
have to remove the damaged links
entirely<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:50.039> case<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.700> our

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
entirely which case we need to take our

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.260 
entirely which case we need to take our
chain<00:00:51.149> tool<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:52.500> split<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> chain<00:00:53.610> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
chain tool and then split the chain just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.380 
chain tool and then split the chain just
behind<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.020> effective<00:00:55.500> links<00:00:55.969> now<00:00:56.969> before<00:00:57.300> we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
behind the effective links now before we

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.840 
behind the effective links now before we
do<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:58.530> worth<00:00:58.770> mentioning<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.760> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
do that it's worth mentioning that you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
do that it's worth mentioning that you
have<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.239> make<00:01:00.390> sure<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.739> ends<00:01:01.920> of

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
have to make sure that the two ends of

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.830 
have to make sure that the two ends of
the<00:01:02.190> chain<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.789> different<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.510> you've<00:01:03.660> got

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the chain are different so you've got

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.649 
the chain are different so you've got
one<00:01:04.080> narrow<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:05.790> wide<00:01:06.060> bit<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
one narrow bit and one wide bit so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
one narrow bit and one wide bit so
they'll<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.020> join<00:01:07.890> together<00:01:08.299> unless

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
they'll actually join together unless

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.149 
they'll actually join together unless
you're<00:01:09.479> using<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.840> power<00:01:10.049> link<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.950> more<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
you're using a power link but more of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
you're using a power link but more of
that<00:01:11.220> later<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.869> need<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> make<00:01:13.380> sure

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that later now you need to make sure

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
that later now you need to make sure
that<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.390> pin<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.590> chain<00:01:16.890> -<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.220> hits<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that the pin on the chain - or hits the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340 
that the pin on the chain - or hits the
chain<00:01:18.720> squarely<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:21.479> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.689> push<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> pin

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
chain squarely you want to push the pin

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.800 
chain squarely you want to push the pin
until<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.830> almost<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> way<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:23.939> but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
until it's almost all the way out but

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.859 
until it's almost all the way out but
not<00:01:25.049> quite<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:26.670> actually<00:01:26.939> essential<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
not quite it's actually essential that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.270 
not quite it's actually essential that
you<00:01:27.990> stop<00:01:28.549> before<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.909> comes<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.329> because

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
you stop before it comes out because

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.460 
you stop before it comes out because
when<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:32.400> rejoining<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> chain<00:01:33.470> we're

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
when we're rejoining the chain we're

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.640 
when we're rejoining the chain we're
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> rely<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.430> little<00:01:35.970> lip<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
going to rely on that little lip there

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.890 
going to rely on that little lip there
to<00:01:37.650> hold<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> two<00:01:38.340> ends<00:01:38.490> together<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to hold the two ends together so if it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
to hold the two ends together so if it
comes<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.640> then<00:01:41.640> there's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
comes all the way out then there's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.639 
comes all the way out then there's
absolutely<00:01:42.270> no<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:42.630> earth<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.200> rejoin

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
absolutely no one earth you can rejoin

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.480 
absolutely no one earth you can rejoin
it<00:01:44.149> unless<00:01:45.200> there<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.229> another<00:01:46.350> unless<00:01:46.920> you've

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it unless there is another unless you've

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.510 
it unless there is another unless you've
got<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.970> Shimano<00:01:48.600> joining<00:01:49.170> pin<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:50.430> pack

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.020 

so<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.570> is<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.170> shimano<00:01:56.560> joining<00:01:57.340> pin<00:01:57.549> what

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
so this is the shimano joining pin what

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.819 
so this is the shimano joining pin what
it<00:01:58.119> does<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.600> makes<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.840> easier<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.380> rejoin

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
it does is it makes it easier to rejoin

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.560 
it does is it makes it easier to rejoin
the<00:02:00.009> chain<00:02:00.280> because<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.729> got<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.090> extra

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
the chain because it's got this extra

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.770 
the chain because it's got this extra
bit<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:02.110> slides<00:02:02.619> into<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.490> chain<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.060> holds

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
bit that slides into the chain and holds

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.320 
bit that slides into the chain and holds
it<00:02:04.869> in<00:02:04.990> place<00:02:05.229> so<00:02:05.649> just<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.610> demonstrate<00:02:06.640> on

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
it in place so just to demonstrate on

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.229 
it in place so just to demonstrate on
this<00:02:07.479> spread<00:02:08.020> link<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.849> push<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.119> in

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
this spread link you can just push it in

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.930 
this spread link you can just push it in
and<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.989> chains<00:02:11.290> held<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.709> place<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.790> then

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and the chains held in place you then

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.059 
and the chains held in place you then
use<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.390> chain<00:02:13.599> tool<00:02:13.780> as<00:02:13.900> normal<00:02:14.230> wind<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.950> in

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
use the chain tool as normal wind it in

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.910 
use the chain tool as normal wind it in
and<00:02:15.280> then<00:02:15.550> snap<00:02:15.940> off<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.150> extra<00:02:16.630> bit<00:02:16.920> so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and then snap off the extra bit so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.130 
and then snap off the extra bit so
Shimano<00:02:18.640> should<00:02:19.090> always<00:02:19.209> officially<00:02:20.019> be

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
Shimano should always officially be

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.020 
Shimano should always officially be
rejoined<00:02:20.590> using<00:02:21.010> one<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.160> these<00:02:21.340> well<00:02:21.940> that

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
rejoined using one of these well that

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.790 
rejoined using one of these well that
you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.420> budget<00:02:22.810> which<00:02:23.500> I've<00:02:23.650> done

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
you can budget which I've done

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.740 
you can budget which I've done
successfully<00:02:24.130> in<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> past<00:02:24.459> although<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
successfully in the past although is to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.059 
successfully in the past although is to
get<00:02:25.930> your<00:02:26.050> home<00:02:26.230> trick<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.769> you<00:02:26.890> should

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
get your home trick and you should

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.470 
get your home trick and you should
probably<00:02:27.310> then<00:02:27.549> replace<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.060> when<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.390> get

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
probably then replace it when you get

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.090 
probably then replace it when you get
back

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.770 

now<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.280> clever<00:02:33.940> little<00:02:34.030> bit<00:02:34.299> of<00:02:34.390> kit<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
now this clever little bit of kit is a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.020 
now this clever little bit of kit is a
power<00:02:35.140> link<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:36.010> what<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.250> does<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.700> means<00:02:36.910> you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
power link and what it does it means you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.809 
power link and what it does it means you
can<00:02:37.150> rejoin<00:02:37.630> your<00:02:37.810> chain<00:02:38.140> without<00:02:39.100> using<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
can rejoin your chain without using a

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.210 
can rejoin your chain without using a
chain<00:02:40.090> tool<00:02:40.330> unlike<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.019> other<00:02:41.170> methods<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
chain tool unlike the other methods it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.530 
chain tool unlike the other methods it
relies<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:43.120> narrow<00:02:43.840> ends<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.350> chain<00:02:44.650> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
relies on to narrow ends of chain and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.640 
relies on to narrow ends of chain and
then<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.569> power<00:02:46.930> link<00:02:47.790> fits<00:02:48.790> onto<00:02:49.239> itself

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
then the power link fits onto itself

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.920 
then the power link fits onto itself
like<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:52.269> when<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.690> place<00:02:52.900> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
like that and then when you place the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.089 
like that and then when you place the
chain<00:02:53.260> under<00:02:53.530> tension<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:54.160> locks<00:02:54.549> into<00:02:54.819> place

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.280 

back<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> our<00:02:59.879> original<00:02:59.939> method<00:03:00.480> now<00:03:00.750> it's

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
back to our original method now it's

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.470 
back to our original method now it's
time<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.500> rethread<00:03:02.159> our<00:03:02.489> chain<00:03:02.790> onto<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.209> bike

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
time to rethread our chain onto the bike

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.479 
time to rethread our chain onto the bike
a<00:03:03.750> few<00:03:04.379> things<00:03:04.530> bear<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.829> mind<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
a few things bear in mind here just to

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.179 
a few things bear in mind here just to
make<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> easier<00:03:06.090> firstly<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.860> want<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.069> make

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
make it easier firstly you want to make

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.670 
make it easier firstly you want to make
sure<00:03:08.340> your<00:03:08.549> rear<00:03:08.700> derailleur<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
sure your rear derailleur is in the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.949 
sure your rear derailleur is in the
position<00:03:11.129> underneath<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.000> smallest<00:03:12.329> cog<00:03:12.689> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
position underneath the smallest cog to

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.170 
position underneath the smallest cog to
ourselves<00:03:13.079> as<00:03:13.590> much<00:03:13.769> slack<00:03:14.189> as<00:03:14.220> possible<00:03:14.400> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
ourselves as much slack as possible and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.119 
ourselves as much slack as possible and
equally<00:03:15.510> at<00:03:15.659> the<00:03:15.750> front<00:03:16.019> depending<00:03:16.409> on<00:03:16.530> how

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
equally at the front depending on how

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.729 
equally at the front depending on how
you've<00:03:17.310> got<00:03:17.489> your<00:03:17.730> front<00:03:18.150> set<00:03:18.480> up<00:03:18.690> put<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.709> in

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you've got your front set up put it in

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.119 
you've got your front set up put it in
the<00:03:19.799> smallest<00:03:20.190> chainring<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:21.840> got<00:03:22.019> one<00:03:22.230> then

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
the smallest chainring you got one then

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.309 
the smallest chainring you got one then
also<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.329> need<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.659> bear<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.870> mind<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
also you need to bear in mind that that

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.110 
also you need to bear in mind that that
protruding<00:03:25.890> pin<00:03:26.190> isn't<00:03:26.640> going<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.819> go<00:03:26.909> through

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
protruding pin isn't going to go through

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.789 
protruding pin isn't going to go through
your<00:03:27.239> rear<00:03:27.390> mech<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.200> want<00:03:28.439> to<00:03:28.530> start

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
your rear mech so you want to start

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.610 
your rear mech so you want to start
threading<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.420> other<00:03:30.540> end<00:03:30.780> through<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.319> then

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
threading the other end through and then

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.319 
threading the other end through and then
also<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.819> have<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.209> that

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
also I like to have it so that

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.899 
also I like to have it so that
protruding<00:03:34.109> bit<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.440> sticking<00:03:34.890> outside<00:03:35.340> on

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
protruding bit is sticking outside on

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.000 
protruding bit is sticking outside on
the<00:03:36.000> bike<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.930> makes<00:03:37.109> using<00:03:37.409> a<00:03:37.530> chain<00:03:37.799> tool

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
the bike so it makes using a chain tool

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.280 
the bike so it makes using a chain tool
easier<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.579> then<00:03:38.879> I<00:03:38.970> also<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.569> to<00:03:39.599> rejoin<00:03:39.900> it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
easier and then I also like to rejoin it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.309 
easier and then I also like to rejoin it
so<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.560> here<00:03:40.829> between<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.549> rear<00:03:41.760> mech<00:03:42.000> and

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
so it's here between the rear mech and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.899 
so it's here between the rear mech and
the<00:03:43.319> chain<00:03:43.560> rings<00:03:44.060> time<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.090> rejoin<00:03:45.569> it<00:03:45.750> now

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
the chain rings time to rejoin it now

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.069 
the chain rings time to rejoin it now
you'll<00:03:47.909> see<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.269> thanks<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.569> our<00:03:48.720> technique

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
you'll see that thanks to our technique

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.259 
you'll see that thanks to our technique
earlier<00:03:49.409> on<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.829> chain<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.159> holding<00:03:50.909> itself

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
earlier on the chain is holding itself

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.819 
earlier on the chain is holding itself
in<00:03:51.420> place<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:54.629> simply<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> case<00:03:55.769> of

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
in place and then simply a case of

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.629

winding<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.400> chain<00:03:56.639> tool<00:03:56.849> in<00:03:58.459> pushing<00:03:59.459> the

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
winding the chain tool in pushing the

winding the chain tool in pushing the
pin<00:03:59.819> home<00:04:00.230> now<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.920> needs<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.129> be<00:04:02.220> careful<00:04:02.819> when

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
pin home now it needs to be careful when

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.420 
pin home now it needs to be careful when
it<00:04:03.150> gets<00:04:03.389> almost<00:04:03.660> all<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.079> way<00:04:04.199> home<00:04:05.510> because

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
it gets almost all the way home because

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.369 
it gets almost all the way home because
you'll<00:04:08.430> often<00:04:08.609> find<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.780> get<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.959> stiff

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
you'll often find that you get a stiff

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.759 
you'll often find that you get a stiff
link<00:04:10.709> where<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.220> rejoin<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.500> some<00:04:13.500> chain

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
link where you rejoin it some chain

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.310 
link where you rejoin it some chain
tools<00:04:14.010> got<00:04:14.519> an<00:04:14.579> extra<00:04:14.849> setting<00:04:15.320> inboard

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
tools got an extra setting inboard

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.379 
tools got an extra setting inboard
they're<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.979> generally<00:04:17.430> lightweight

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
they're not generally lightweight

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.449 
they're not generally lightweight
trailside<00:04:18.840> ones<00:04:19.079> like<00:04:19.229> this<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:20.160> they've<00:04:20.310> got

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
trailside ones like this but they've got

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.069 
trailside ones like this but they've got
an<00:04:20.549> invoice<00:04:20.789> estimate<00:04:21.299> specifically<00:04:21.930> for

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
an invoice estimate specifically for

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.230 
an invoice estimate specifically for
getting<00:04:22.320> rid<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.470> stiff<00:04:22.740> links<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:23.729> actually

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
getting rid of stiff links but actually

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.120 
getting rid of stiff links but actually
I<00:04:25.039> think<00:04:26.039> that's<00:04:26.430> pretty<00:04:27.030> good

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
I think that's pretty good

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.060 
I think that's pretty good
okay<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.610> k<00:04:30.560> almost<00:04:31.560> as<00:04:31.680> good<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:31.889> new

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
okay so k almost as good as new

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.589 
okay so k almost as good as new
one<00:04:32.760> thing<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.030> bear<00:04:33.150> in<00:04:33.240> mind<00:04:33.270> though

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
one thing to bear in mind though

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.170 
one thing to bear in mind though
depending<00:04:34.139> on<00:04:34.440> how<00:04:34.680> many<00:04:34.740> links<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.550> actually

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
depending on how many links you actually

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.700 
depending on how many links you actually
had<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.419> take<00:04:36.599> out<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.990> chain<00:04:37.229> you've

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
had to take out of the chain you've

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.589 
had to take out of the chain you've
affected<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.669> length<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.180> chain<00:04:39.389> and<00:04:39.539> you

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
affected the length of the chain and you

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.629 
affected the length of the chain and you
might<00:04:39.810> find<00:04:40.050> that<00:04:40.260> some<00:04:40.770> gears<00:04:41.039> are<00:04:41.250> now

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
might find that some gears are now

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.399 
might find that some gears are now
unusable<00:04:42.389> because<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.750> chain<00:04:42.990> isn't<00:04:43.169> long

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
unusable because the chain isn't long

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.320 
unusable because the chain isn't long
enough<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.889> have<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.039> check<00:04:44.370> before<00:04:44.789> you<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:45.120> on

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
enough so have a check before you get on

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.220 
enough so have a check before you get on
the<00:04:45.479> bike<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.720> ride<00:04:46.199> it

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.450 

because<00:04:51.150> if<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.840> in<00:04:52.960> your<00:04:53.050> big<00:04:53.200> ring<00:04:53.460> along

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
because if you in your big ring along

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.760 
because if you in your big ring along
with<00:04:54.610> upset<00:04:59.370> can't<00:05:00.370> use<00:05:00.550> that<00:05:00.670> gear<00:05:00.910> anymore

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
with upset can't use that gear anymore

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.900 
with upset can't use that gear anymore
so<00:05:02.770> there<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:02.950> go<00:05:03.100> then<00:05:03.280> really<00:05:03.700> quite

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
so there you go then really quite

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.680 
so there you go then really quite
