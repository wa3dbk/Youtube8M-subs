00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
something else that like works I think

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.759 
something else that like works I think
that's<00:03:09.639> very<00:03:09.939> natural<00:03:10.209> I've<00:03:10.569> seen<00:03:10.750> some<00:03:10.989> other

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
that's very natural I've seen some other

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.860 
that's very natural I've seen some other
videos<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.430> people<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.150> YouTube<00:03:13.540> saying

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
videos of people here on YouTube saying

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.289 
videos of people here on YouTube saying
that<00:03:14.439> they<00:03:14.560> had<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:15.129> find<00:03:15.549> different<00:03:15.790> products

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
that they had to find different products

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.240 
that they had to find different products
to<00:03:16.329> fit<00:03:17.169> their<00:03:17.319> hair<00:03:17.530> because<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.919> just<00:03:18.040> seemed

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
to fit their hair because it just seemed

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.190 
to fit their hair because it just seemed
like<00:03:18.280> your<00:03:18.790> hair<00:03:19.060> just<00:03:19.209> outgrow<00:03:19.659> the<00:03:19.810> product

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
like your hair just outgrow the product

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.530 
like your hair just outgrow the product
unfortunately<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:20.919> I<00:03:21.159> think<00:03:21.669> really<00:03:22.359> it's
