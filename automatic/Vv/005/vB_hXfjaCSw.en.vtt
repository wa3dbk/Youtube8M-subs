00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
funny and I thought well that was the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.369 
funny and I thought well that was the
tree<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.180> fell<00:00:57.420> over<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:57.870> no<00:00:58.020> reason<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
tree that fell over there's no reason to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.729 
tree that fell over there's no reason to
get<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:59.059> it's<00:01:00.059> already<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.870> can't

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
get up because it's already down I can't

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
get up because it's already down I can't
prevent<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.489> left<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:02.910> until<00:01:03.390> move

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
prevent it so I left it there until move

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.910 
prevent it so I left it there until move
so<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.409> made<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.799> fancy<00:01:05.339> regulator<00:01:06.090> stands

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
so i made this fancy regulator stands

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.440 
so i made this fancy regulator stands
stands<00:01:08.150> over<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> summer<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.350> both

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
stands over the summer they got both

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.719
