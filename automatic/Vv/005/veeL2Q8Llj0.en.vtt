00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 who came with Uli Hoseß Michael Skibbe has come to us Michael 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.920
 To lose Skibbe away from the leader is fine 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 but how do you rate the phone 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.629
 here meadows have been rolled over for the first 15 minutes 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.059
 Might have been scared on the pitch so little as against Bayern 

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:22.649
 Actually only reacts to what has been offered and then they are 

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:26.109
 Teams just too strong for Eintracht Frankfurt for mine 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.949
 team 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.240
 and I have to say that today apart from Pirmin Schwegler I have the 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.080
 At this level can also play with those with the percent of boys 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.180
 Mishka saw an ex-leverkusener next about Kusel I have too little 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.780
 Seen in my team where you can say there is the substance then 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.170
 in such a game it is therefore really good to pull out of the affair 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 what role he plays so early goal against this until today 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.659
 have ever seen after 72 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.279
 Seconds and if we look at the formation also there is natural 

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:57.300
 a lot of things went wrong »Dr 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 had made the biggest mistake out of you 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.490
 then, of course, stupid longer longer error chain will be percent fraught 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.320
 fair in the center of not prevented percent 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.290
 which of course also with the deep pass on the wing much to do 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.500
 retired and percent you have to be Selim Teber was natural 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.650
 then also in the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.010
 in the situation that defended ball is good by Ralf Fährmann 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.790
 Of course he has to react to the ball but not Teva 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.980
 Barr nicer you have to 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.050
 As a set defensive player de da makes this flank already be prevented 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.950
 got to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.160
 precise flank was difficult to interpret but hardly now 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
 We have to rank with bets because we are naturally more focused 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.170
 jump to the ball and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.940
 but altogether too late transformed on defensive in the situation euro it goes 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:38.870
 if you are the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.020
 Fear of own courage and the opponent has also in the quality 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.440
 is clearly superior that we have to accept as well as we can 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.430
 also should not talk around it long 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.230
 we have to join Eintracht Frankfurt over the next year and a half 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.220
 completely different so that we in the Bundesliga at all 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.750
 are competitive 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.619
 These are relatively clear words that underlines again 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.469
 he would say what they said but what did the crew miss? 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.360
 also after this early goal 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 both in use in the ball really want to have but also 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.969
 this percent 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.389
 what would you have already said that is the find 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.589
 because percent I can only have the ball "I wanted to be brave 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.229
 Mayor to do with it 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:21.619
 and I think there is a lot in the bad because there is still a lot of work percent 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.909
 but is available 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.379
 it has been recognized they are called that there are games 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.379
 there it works and there are many officials mend over four volumes 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.139
 still the art Konstanz 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.790
 the second new then in the sixth minute 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.540
 So that was five minutes later directly next 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.699
 Counter-strike that from a standard situation 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:46.589
 This is a misunderstanding between as the man under Christoph Spycher 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.129
 or is that simply not enough of them? 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.999
 Each of these four cities has a big mistake from Alex Maier in his position 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.990
 the corner did not occupy has to stand before and percent 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.209
 otherwise the corner will be 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.079
 Probably not landed in goal everyone had since the goalkeeper nothing 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:03.819
 to do with 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.519
 but still completely free also said Mannheims header comes so may 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.969
 may not be in the place that because of it Alex Meier because the allocation 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.119
 not true 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.540
 around the 13 new then directly in mountain 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.570
 Of course, the first minute of the game is not a situation at all 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.660
 as a coach is incredibly difficult because you have but then yes 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.500
 a lot of time until break and b what reactions do you have? 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.509
 team 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.139
 noticed or what reactions they did not feel 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.289
 Renault also likes to have a new remote so easy in a circle 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.429
 Olpe who happened in this tenth Schaeffler Kai Rüder would still 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.459
 It should not be allowed to stand up and just stand forward 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.979
 after losing the ball 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.979
 Nethery but as I said in the mail a team like Bayer 04 a play 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:50.400
 comes and the company quite especially in the initial phase very quickly 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.899
 then it gets incredibly hard the percentage points are great excellent 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:57.779
 Shooting technique has that all of Israel and that he is such scenes then 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.289
 percent 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.089
 does not bid two or three times but the first point is a place 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.899
 No, we just have to realize that I believe that 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:04.919
 most important 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.469
 who wants to come even a few scenes in the majority know if I have 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.889
 have enough time to cut it together while still having a few more goals 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.999
 Shoot can be paid extra 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.139
 Bayer's playing ability is really fast, it's excellent there 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.739
 that really percent after that by then I see good work being done here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.849
 and percent are going to play for the championship this year, here I am 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:23.789
 certainly 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.730
 and percent 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.440
 We have to face teams like Bayern Munich like Bayer 04 Leverkusen 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.809
 and the OKI 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.349
 like Werder Bremen or others here have a clique far above our Euro 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.839
 Conditions play against such teams to be able to exist for it 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.109
 my team is unfortunately way too average owns 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.590
 again with their early substitution of 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.650
 Cairo, what was your consideration 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.200
 played out bad new man who may have a bit of melancholy 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.720
 because a little better 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.330
 I'll bring you compulsory program expanded r all old photographs 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330
 Thanks a lot Michael Skibbe he definitely a good one in this sense 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.120
 return home 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.930
 all small channels were known
