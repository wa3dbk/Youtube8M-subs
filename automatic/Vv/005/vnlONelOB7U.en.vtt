possible and then he's going to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.569 
possible and then he's going to
transition<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> bomb<00:00:31.080> phase<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
transition into the bomb phase this is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
transition into the bomb phase this is
the<00:00:32.700> fight<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> whole<00:00:33.630> fight<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> bomb

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the fight the whole fight is the bomb

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740 
the fight the whole fight is the bomb
phase<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.300> pretty

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
phase if you can do this it's pretty

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.540 
phase if you can do this it's pretty
easy<00:00:37.020> other<00:00:37.320> than<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> engineer<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
easy other than the the engineer and the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.280 
easy other than the the engineer and the
healers<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.210> survive<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.840> stuff<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
healers have to survive the stuff the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
healers have to survive the stuff the
flowers<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.219> stuff<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> most

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
bomb groups we have one bomber group

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.420 
bomb groups we have one bomber group
that<00:00:46.140> gets<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> stuff<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and for the most part it's pretty

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
and for the most part it's pretty
obvious<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.609> an<00:00:59.789> obvious

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
obvious like that one that's an obvious

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
obvious like that one that's an obvious
call<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.590> two

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

at<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.460> same<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.150> sometimes<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.540> don't

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
at the same time and sometimes you don't

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
at the same time and sometimes you don't
see<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.830> guy<00:01:23.009> called<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> bombs<00:01:23.700> for

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
see one so one guy called the bombs for

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
see one so one guy called the bombs for
each<00:01:24.030> group<00:01:24.240> trust<00:01:24.509> me<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> helped<00:01:25.049> us<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> lot

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
each group trust me that helped us a lot

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.789 
each group trust me that helped us a lot
when<00:01:25.979> we<00:01:26.009> started<00:01:26.369> doing<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.140> yeah<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
when we started doing that so yeah the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.200 
when we started doing that so yeah the
thing<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.189> bombs<00:01:29.369> when<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.000> killed

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
thing with these bombs when we killed

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.249 
thing with these bombs when we killed
these<00:01:30.299> bonds<00:01:30.600> you'll<00:01:30.720> notice<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.079> take<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
these bonds you'll notice that we take a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.929 
these bonds you'll notice that we take a
ton<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> raid<00:01:31.710> damage<00:01:31.920> boom<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> bomb<00:01:32.700> goes

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
ton of raid damage boom that bomb goes

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.490 
ton of raid damage boom that bomb goes
off<00:01:33.090> everybody<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> raid<00:01:33.900> takes<00:01:34.079> damage

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
off everybody in the raid takes damage

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
off everybody in the raid takes damage
so<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.979> means<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.970> stagger<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
so that means you have to stagger the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
so that means you have to stagger the
bomb<00:01:36.659> explosions<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:38.400> group<00:01:38.549> kills<00:01:38.850> one

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
bomb explosions so one group kills one

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.370 
bomb explosions so one group kills one
bomb<00:01:39.240> another<00:01:39.600> group<00:01:39.780> kills<00:01:39.990> another<00:01:40.200> bomb

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
bomb another group kills another bomb

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.780 
bomb another group kills another bomb
but<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:40.950> three<00:01:41.220> bombs<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.759> off

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but if you have like three bombs go off

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
but if you have like three bombs go off
in<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> row<00:01:42.270> then<00:01:42.750> they'll<00:01:42.930> die<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.409> will<00:01:43.920> die

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
in a row then they'll die them will die

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.399 
in a row then they'll die them will die
so<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.180> started<00:01:45.420> doing<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.869> there's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so one thing we started doing is there's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
so one thing we started doing is there's
a<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.369> overpowered<00:01:48.000> trinket

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
a really really overpowered trinket

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.660 
a really really overpowered trinket
that's<00:01:48.689> for<00:01:48.990> PvP<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.860> overpowered<00:01:50.250> PvP

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that's for PvP a really overpowered PvP

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.380 
that's for PvP a really overpowered PvP
gadget<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> restores<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:53.240> 8000<00:01:54.240> health

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
gadget that restores I think 8000 health

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
gadget that restores I think 8000 health
or<00:01:54.570> something<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:56.009> use<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
or something and we use that for this

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.340 
or something and we use that for this
fight<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.149> least<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> few<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.630> us<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.140> you'll

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
fight at least a few of us do so you'll

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
fight at least a few of us do so you'll
notice<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.710> you've<00:01:58.829> rewind<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.280> I<00:02:00.090> popped

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
notice if you've rewind that I popped

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.450 
notice if you've rewind that I popped
that<00:02:01.200> gadget<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> took<00:02:02.159> that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
that gadget right when I took that

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
that gadget right when I took that
damage<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> raid<00:02:03.689> healed<00:02:03.990> everybody<00:02:04.290> for

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
damage and I raid healed everybody for

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
damage and I raid healed everybody for
like<00:02:04.710> five<00:02:05.070> 5k<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.090> hits<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
like five 5k I think it hits up to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
like five 5k I think it hits up to
myself<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.320> five<00:02:07.829> other<00:02:08.099> targets<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.580> four

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
myself and five other targets for four

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.830 
myself and five other targets for four
other<00:02:08.849> targets<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.179> don't<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.690> good<00:02:09.810> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
other targets I don't it's really good I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.180 
other targets I don't it's really good I
think<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.140> called<00:02:10.289> recovery<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.860> check<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
think it's called recovery so check that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.620 
think it's called recovery so check that
out<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.849> helps<00:02:12.239> with<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
out it really helps with the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
out it really helps with the
shilling<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> bombs<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.490> started

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
shilling for the bombs so we started

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.370 
shilling for the bombs so we started
using<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.720> didn't<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:15.990> everybody

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
using that we didn't have everybody

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.840 
using that we didn't have everybody
using<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.160> decided<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.760> was

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
using it but we decided that it was

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.400 
using it but we decided that it was
better<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.540> only<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.840> few<00:02:19.080> people

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
better just to have only a few people

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
better just to have only a few people
per<00:02:19.590> group<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:21.210> helped<00:02:21.450> us<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
per group use it and that helped us a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
per group use it and that helped us a
lot<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.110> check<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.530> out<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:23.640> kick<00:02:23.790> all

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
lot so check that out once we kick all

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.730 
lot so check that out once we kick all
the<00:02:23.970> batteries<00:02:24.240> in<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.050> energy<00:02:25.320> shield<00:02:25.500> phase

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
the batteries in the energy shield phase

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.050 
the batteries in the energy shield phase
somebody<00:02:26.190> gets<00:02:26.370> marked<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.910> click

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
somebody gets marked they have to click

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.700 
somebody gets marked they have to click
the<00:02:27.150> energy<00:02:27.420> shield<00:02:27.630> boom<00:02:27.990> boom<00:02:28.350> phase<00:02:28.530> again

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the energy shield boom boom phase again

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.800 
the energy shield boom boom phase again
rinse<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> repeat<00:02:29.640> that's<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.390> whole<00:02:30.540> fight

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
rinse and repeat that's the whole fight

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.390 
rinse and repeat that's the whole fight
that's<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.800> literally<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.340> just

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
that's it like literally it's just

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's it like literally it's just
cycles<00:02:32.970> with<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.270> as<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.380> phases<00:02:34.710> go<00:02:34.830> on

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
cycles with this as the phases go on

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.370 
cycles with this as the phases go on
like<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.030> next<00:02:36.450> bomb<00:02:36.660> phase<00:02:36.960> there<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.230> be

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
like this next bomb phase there will be

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.470 
like this next bomb phase there will be
more<00:02:37.770> bombs<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.460> there<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.730> what's

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
more bombs I think there was what's

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.720 
more bombs I think there was what's
seven<00:02:40.380> bombs<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> first<00:02:41.220> phase<00:02:41.460> and

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
seven bombs in the first phase and

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.160 
seven bombs in the first phase and
there's<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.000> nine<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.540> one<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> don't

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
there's like nine in this one I don't

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.960 
there's like nine in this one I don't
it's<00:02:43.590> either<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:43.980> either<00:02:44.070> five<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.640> seven

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
it's either it's either five and seven

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.730 
it's either it's either five and seven
or<00:02:45.150> five<00:02:45.660> seven<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.410> might<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.530> five

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
or five seven I think it might be five

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.970 
or five seven I think it might be five
seven<00:02:47.040> nine<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.480> yeah<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:49.350> bombs<00:02:49.560> come<00:02:49.800> out

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
seven nine so yeah more bombs come out

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.070 
seven nine so yeah more bombs come out
bomb<00:02:50.880> group<00:02:51.090> calls<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.690> wait<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
bomb group calls it I wait for the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.570 
bomb group calls it I wait for the
octopus's<00:02:52.530> reactor<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.040> running<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:53.520> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
octopus's reactor this is running then I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.490 
octopus's reactor this is running then I
go<00:02:53.670> boom<00:02:53.880> boom<00:02:54.090> movement<00:02:54.510> ability<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.930> kill

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
go boom boom movement ability in kill

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.790 
go boom boom movement ability in kill
bombs<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.310> think<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> guys<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.260> don't

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
bombs I think you guys get it so I don't

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.200 
bombs I think you guys get it so I don't
think<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.070> end<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.310> having<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.550> use<00:02:59.700> my<00:02:59.820> trinket

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
think I end up having to use my trinket

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.750 
think I end up having to use my trinket
until<00:03:01.200> way<00:03:01.410> later<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.340> some<00:03:02.640> people

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
until way later but I think some people

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.870 
until way later but I think some people
might<00:03:03.090> use<00:03:03.420> theirs<00:03:04.370> mmm<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.490> don't<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.760> it's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
might use theirs mmm I don't know it's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.870 
might use theirs mmm I don't know it's
hard<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.540> say<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:06.900> yeah<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.520> reason<00:03:08.790> why

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
hard to say but yeah the reason why

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.610 
hard to say but yeah the reason why
we're<00:03:09.030> using<00:03:09.120> an<00:03:09.300> engineer<00:03:09.630> tank<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.110> you'll

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
we're using an engineer tank so you'll

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.170 
we're using an engineer tank so you'll
notice<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.280> see<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.520> red<00:03:11.670> lines<00:03:11.910> going

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
notice that you see the red lines going

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.260 
notice that you see the red lines going
across<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.050> room<00:03:13.230> right<00:03:13.410> there<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.790> is

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
across the the room right there that is

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.910 
across the the room right there that is
because<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.840> engineer<00:03:16.170> tank<00:03:16.410> if<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.740> was

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
because of the engineer tank if I was

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.560 
because of the engineer tank if I was
tanking<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.400> those<00:03:17.610> lines<00:03:17.940> would<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.270> spinning

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
tanking it those lines would be spinning

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.300 
tanking it those lines would be spinning
even<00:03:18.960> faster<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.620> because<00:03:19.740> I'm<00:03:19.980> closer<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
even faster just because I'm closer to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.530 
even faster just because I'm closer to
the<00:03:20.430> boss<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:20.730> since<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.060> engineer<00:03:21.450> is

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the boss but since the engineer is

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.510 
the boss but since the engineer is
farther<00:03:21.870> away<00:03:21.900> he<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.800> make<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.130> distance

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
farther away he can make the distance

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.180 
farther away he can make the distance
between<00:03:23.670> those<00:03:24.000> lines<00:03:24.330> much<00:03:24.870> much<00:03:25.830> smaller

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
between those lines much much smaller

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.340 
between those lines much much smaller
than<00:03:26.730> any<00:03:27.000> other<00:03:27.180> tank<00:03:27.420> would<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:27.900> engineer

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
than any other tank would so engineer

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.170 
than any other tank would so engineer
tanks<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.770> think<00:03:28.950> everybody<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.820> now<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
tanks I think everybody right now in the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
tanks I think everybody right now in the
game<00:03:30.360> that's<00:03:30.630> killed<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.020> it's<00:03:31.260> done<00:03:31.320> with

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
game that's killed this it's done with

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.530 
game that's killed this it's done with
an<00:03:31.590> engineered<00:03:31.920> tank<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:33.150> at<00:03:33.240> least<00:03:33.390> it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
an engineered tank or at least it's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.390 
an engineered tank or at least it's
optimal<00:03:33.990> with<00:03:34.500> an<00:03:34.620> engineer<00:03:34.920> tank<00:03:35.160> just

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
optimal with an engineer tank just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.500 
optimal with an engineer tank just
because<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.120> how<00:03:36.180> far<00:03:36.360> we<00:03:36.480> are

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
because of that you see how far we are

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.730 
because of that you see how far we are
at<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.810> engineer<00:03:37.170> tank<00:03:37.380> group<00:03:37.560> right<00:03:37.710> there

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
at that engineer tank group right there

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.170 
at that engineer tank group right there
is<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> guy<00:03:38.190> Marcus<00:03:38.550> bomb<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
is the guy Marcus bomb and the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.250 
is the guy Marcus bomb and the
background<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:39.630> there<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.990> engineer

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
background right there is the engineer

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.560 
background right there is the engineer
tank<00:03:40.580> it's<00:03:41.580> pretty<00:03:41.760> optimal<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.300> might<00:03:42.450> use

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
tank it's pretty optimal we might use

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.010 
tank it's pretty optimal we might use
the<00:03:42.660> healing<00:03:42.900> trinket<00:03:43.200> right<00:03:43.320> here<00:03:45.020> this

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
the healing trinket right here this

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.810 
the healing trinket right here this
looks<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.410> situation<00:03:46.830> where<00:03:46.950> I'd<00:03:47.010> use<00:03:47.190> it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
looks like a situation where I'd use it

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.400 
looks like a situation where I'd use it
no<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:49.850> guess<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:50.300> didn't<00:03:50.480> use<00:03:50.600> it<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.960> think<00:03:51.260> I

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
no I guess I didn't use it I think I

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.450 
no I guess I didn't use it I think I
might<00:03:51.530> use<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.740> right<00:03:51.830> here<00:03:51.980> though<00:03:52.160> you'll

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
might use it right here though you'll

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.360 
might use it right here though you'll
see<00:03:53.260> did<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:56.470> know<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.500> didn't<00:03:57.740> use<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:58.160> I

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
see did you know I didn't use it so I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.190 
see did you know I didn't use it so I
say<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.700> saved<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.300> right<00:03:59.450> there<00:03:59.630> because<00:03:59.810> we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
say I saved it right there because we

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.930 
say I saved it right there because we
lived<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.710> we<00:04:01.160> were<00:04:01.250> getting<00:04:01.340> ready<00:04:01.430> stack<00:04:01.760> up

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
lived and we were getting ready stack up

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.150 
lived and we were getting ready stack up
so<00:04:02.210> once<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.960> kill<00:04:03.110> all<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.290> bombs<00:04:03.500> we<00:04:03.980> leave

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
so once you kill all the bombs we leave

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.340 
so once you kill all the bombs we leave
like<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.790> think<00:04:05.270> three<00:04:05.660> bombs<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.260> then

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
like I think three bombs up and then

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.410 
like I think three bombs up and then
when<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.500> do<00:04:06.590> defense<00:04:06.920> grids<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.550> he<00:04:08.120> goes<00:04:08.270> up

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
when you do defense grids and he goes up

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.340 
when you do defense grids and he goes up
in<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.570> air<00:04:08.600> when<00:04:08.810> he<00:04:08.870> goes<00:04:08.990> up<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.290> air

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
in the air when he goes up in the air

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.830 
in the air when he goes up in the air
like<00:04:09.560> that<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.160> bombs<00:04:10.340> explodes<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.210> you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
like that all the bombs explodes so you

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
like that all the bombs explodes so you
have<00:04:11.960> to<00:04:12.050> get<00:04:12.140> everybody<00:04:12.320> healed<00:04:12.650> up

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
have to get everybody healed up

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.520 
have to get everybody healed up
everybody<00:04:13.220> stacked<00:04:13.550> up<00:04:13.760> just<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.090> get<00:04:14.240> healed

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
everybody stacked up just to get healed

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
everybody stacked up just to get healed
Defense<00:04:15.530> Grid<00:04:15.800> and<00:04:16.420> hopefully<00:04:17.420> you<00:04:17.510> lived

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
Defense Grid and hopefully you lived

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
to like 40% 60% 80% just so they blow up

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.960

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
in a way to where we can survive it if

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.490 
in a way to where we can survive it if
they<00:05:38.060> all<00:05:38.180> blow<00:05:38.420> up<00:05:38.510> at<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.660> same<00:05:38.840> time<00:05:38.870> we<00:05:39.320> die

they all blow up at the same time we die

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.280
