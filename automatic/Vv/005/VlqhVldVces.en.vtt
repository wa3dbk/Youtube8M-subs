before<00:00:14.320> we<00:00:14.500> start<00:00:14.830> I<00:00:15.099> want<00:00:15.520> you<00:00:15.639> to<00:00:15.820> memorize

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
before we start I want you to memorize

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.720 
before we start I want you to memorize
the<00:00:16.480> order<00:00:16.510> in<00:00:16.900> which<00:00:17.050> these<00:00:17.289> are<00:00:17.350> written

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the order in which these are written

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.009 
the order in which these are written
because<00:00:18.730> it<00:00:18.880> will<00:00:19.000> help<00:00:19.210> you<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.539> remember<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
because it will help you to remember the

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.560 
because it will help you to remember the
steps<00:00:20.260> to<00:00:20.529> take<00:00:20.560> when<00:00:21.519> you<00:00:21.640> change<00:00:21.970> these<00:00:22.269> from

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
steps to take when you change these from

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.020 
steps to take when you change these from
one<00:00:22.750> to<00:00:22.990> another<00:00:23.100> look<00:00:24.100> at<00:00:24.250> this<00:00:24.430> number<00:00:24.640> again

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
one to another look at this number again

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.840 
one to another look at this number again
and<00:00:25.180> tell<00:00:25.360> me<00:00:25.480> what<00:00:25.690> it<00:00:25.810> is<00:00:26.340> well<00:00:27.340> that's<00:00:27.490> easy

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
and tell me what it is well that's easy

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.310 
and tell me what it is well that's easy
we<00:00:28.060> just<00:00:28.090> said<00:00:28.420> a<00:00:28.449> minute<00:00:28.600> ago<00:00:28.810> with<00:00:29.230> the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
we just said a minute ago with the

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.369 
we just said a minute ago with the
fraction<00:00:29.770> 1/4<00:00:30.310> yes<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:31.090> did<00:00:31.390> but<00:00:31.900> first<00:00:32.169> let<00:00:32.349> me

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
fraction 1/4 yes I did but first let me

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.959 
fraction 1/4 yes I did but first let me
ask<00:00:32.680> you<00:00:32.920> what<00:00:33.100> this<00:00:33.280> word<00:00:33.550> is<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:35.410> record

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
ask you what this word is let's record

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.290 
ask you what this word is let's record
no<00:00:36.969> isn't<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.660> record<00:00:38.140> ok<00:00:38.920> which<00:00:39.219> is<00:00:39.250> it<00:00:39.609> well

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
no isn't that record ok which is it well

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.759 
no isn't that record ok which is it well
now<00:00:40.479> that<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.690> think<00:00:40.719> about<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.409> guess<00:00:41.620> it

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
now that I think about it I guess it

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.219 
now that I think about it I guess it
could<00:00:41.920> be<00:00:42.069> both<00:00:42.249> that's<00:00:42.940> right<00:00:43.300> the<00:00:43.839> word<00:00:44.019> has

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
could be both that's right the word has

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.829 
could be both that's right the word has
two<00:00:44.469> different<00:00:44.859> meanings<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.329> could<00:00:46.600> be<00:00:46.719> the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
two different meanings it could be the

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.700 
two different meanings it could be the
noun<00:00:47.069> record<00:00:48.069> or<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.879> verb<00:00:49.089> record<00:00:49.659> so<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.559> has

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
noun record or the verb record so it has

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.379 
noun record or the verb record so it has
two<00:00:51.039> distinct<00:00:51.670> different<00:00:52.059> meanings

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
two distinct different meanings

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.090 
two distinct different meanings
depending<00:00:52.510> on<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.929> context<00:00:53.679> you<00:00:53.799> are<00:00:53.859> using

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
depending on the context you are using

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.309 
depending on the context you are using
it<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.489> now<00:00:55.179> let's<00:00:55.389> look<00:00:55.510> at<00:00:55.659> this<00:00:55.839> object

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
it in now let's look at this object

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.200 
it in now let's look at this object
again<00:00:56.620> it<00:00:57.069> actually<00:00:57.309> has<00:00:57.579> at<00:00:57.760> least<00:00:57.879> four

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
again it actually has at least four

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.329 
again it actually has at least four
different<00:00:58.690> definitions<00:00:59.319> it<00:00:59.949> could<00:01:00.219> be

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
different definitions it could be

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.180 
different definitions it could be
interpreted<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.120> fraction<00:01:01.659> 1/4<00:01:02.260> where<00:01:03.039> it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
interpreted as a fraction 1/4 where it

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.340 
interpreted as a fraction 1/4 where it
could<00:01:03.370> be<00:01:03.399> interpreted<00:01:03.819> as<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.150> ratio<00:01:04.449> 1<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.080> 4

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
could be interpreted as a ratio 1 to 4

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.410 
could be interpreted as a ratio 1 to 4
or<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.310> could<00:01:06.490> be<00:01:06.640> interpreted<00:01:07.000> as<00:01:07.390> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
or it could be interpreted as a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.289 
or it could be interpreted as a
probability<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:08.860> chance<00:01:09.220> out<00:01:09.400> of<00:01:09.460> 4<00:01:09.790> chances

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
probability one chance out of 4 chances

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.900 
probability one chance out of 4 chances
of<00:01:10.479> something<00:01:10.690> occurring<00:01:11.110> or<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:12.550> could<00:01:12.790> be

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
of something occurring or it could be

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.130 
of something occurring or it could be
interpreted<00:01:13.270> as<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.630> division<00:01:14.110> problem<00:01:14.730> 1/4

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
interpreted as a division problem 1/4

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.630 
interpreted as a division problem 1/4
let's<00:01:17.140> say<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.410> want<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.620> change<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:18.100> fraction

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
let's say I want to change this fraction

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.850 
let's say I want to change this fraction
into<00:01:18.760> a<00:01:18.910> decimal<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:20.080> means<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.470> have<00:01:20.620> to<00:01:20.740> do

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
into a decimal that means I have to do

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.910 
into a decimal that means I have to do
some<00:01:21.070> work<00:01:21.310> some<00:01:22.000> arithmetic<00:01:22.540> operation<00:01:23.260> so

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
some work some arithmetic operation so

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.590 
some work some arithmetic operation so
that<00:01:24.100> means<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.430> have<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.730> interpret<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:25.360> as<00:01:25.570> a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that means I have to interpret this as a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.390 
that means I have to interpret this as a
division<00:01:26.110> problem<00:01:27.720> 1/4<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:30.070> write<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
division problem 1/4 you write the

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.980 
division problem 1/4 you write the
division<00:01:30.550> house<00:01:30.880> alongside<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.540> bottom<00:01:31.810> and

division house alongside the bottom and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.780 
division house alongside the bottom and
imagine<00:01:32.500> tilting<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.950> fraction<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
imagine tilting the fraction so that the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.610 
imagine tilting the fraction so that the
top<00:01:34.000> number<00:01:34.360> slides<00:01:34.600> off<00:01:34.840> into<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.350> division

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
top number slides off into the division

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.430 
top number slides off into the division
house<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:37.330> way<00:01:37.600> you'll<00:01:37.810> always<00:01:37.990> remember

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
house that way you'll always remember

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.990 
house that way you'll always remember
which<00:01:38.740> number<00:01:39.040> goes<00:01:39.070> outside<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.670> division

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
which number goes outside the division

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.230 
which number goes outside the division
house<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.780> which<00:01:41.350> one<00:01:41.530> goes<00:01:41.680> inside<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:42.640> will

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
house and which one goes inside it will

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.840 
house and which one goes inside it will
never<00:01:43.420> be<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.840> other<00:01:43.960> way<00:01:44.200> around<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.490> next

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
never be the other way around the next

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.400 
never be the other way around the next
step<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:46.810> you're<00:01:46.960> dividing<00:01:47.170> a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
step is that when you're dividing a

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.800 
step is that when you're dividing a
larger<00:01:47.800> number<00:01:47.980> into<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.490> smaller<00:01:48.880> number<00:01:49.180> you

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
larger number into a smaller number you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.330 
larger number into a smaller number you
have<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.050> write<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.560> smaller<00:01:50.860> number<00:01:51.220> as<00:01:51.310> a

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
have to write the smaller number as a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.160 
have to write the smaller number as a
decimal<00:01:51.730> number<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.270> place<00:01:52.510> some<00:01:52.780> zeros

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
decimal number and place some zeros

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.070 
decimal number and place some zeros
behind<00:01:53.409> the<00:01:53.680> decimal<00:01:53.890> point<00:01:54.630> we'll<00:01:55.630> use<00:01:55.810> 2

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
behind the decimal point we'll use 2

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.500 
behind the decimal point we'll use 2
zeros<00:01:56.440> for<00:01:56.650> our<00:01:56.800> examples<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:58.210> could<00:01:58.390> use

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
zeros for our examples you could use

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.270 
zeros for our examples you could use
more<00:01:58.780> or<00:01:59.020> less<00:01:59.050> if<00:01:59.470> you<00:01:59.590> wanted<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.100> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
more or less if you wanted to and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.220 
more or less if you wanted to and
sometimes<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.880> will<00:02:01.000> need<00:02:01.030> more<00:02:01.420> other<00:02:01.780> times

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
sometimes you will need more other times

you'll<00:03:50.470> notice<00:03:50.740> that<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:51.220> we're<00:03:51.430> moving<00:03:51.790> from

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
you'll notice that if we're moving from

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.510 
you'll notice that if we're moving from
decimals<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> percents<00:03:52.830> we're<00:03:53.830> moving<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.340> the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
decimals to percents we're moving to the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.580 
decimals to percents we're moving to the
right<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.330> if<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.570> want<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.840> change<00:03:56.080> 25

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
right so if you want to change 25

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.140 
right so if you want to change 25
hundreds<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.190> percent<00:03:57.640> we<00:03:57.820> move<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
hundreds to a percent we move the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.580 
hundreds to a percent we move the
decimal<00:03:58.540> two<00:03:58.720> places<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.320> right<00:03:59.410> and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
decimal two places to the right and

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.920 
decimal two places to the right and
attach<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.070> percent<00:04:00.400> symbol<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:01.330> will<00:04:01.600> always

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
attach a percent symbol it will always

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.930 
attach a percent symbol it will always
be<00:04:02.140> two<00:04:02.350> places<00:04:02.560> either<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.340> right<00:04:03.370> or<00:04:03.550> to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
be two places either to the right or to

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.520 
be two places either to the right or to
the<00:04:03.970> left<00:04:04.090> depending<00:04:04.810> on<00:04:04.960> which<00:04:05.140> direction

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
the left depending on which direction

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.590 
the left depending on which direction
you're<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:05.830> now<00:04:06.730> when<00:04:06.910> our<00:04:06.940> decimal<00:04:07.390> point

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
you're going now when our decimal point

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.150 
you're going now when our decimal point
winds<00:04:07.900> up<00:04:07.990> at<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.230> end<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.590> whole<00:04:08.770> number

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
winds up at the end of a whole number

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.850 
winds up at the end of a whole number
you<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.640> drop<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.870> as<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.080> can<00:04:11.350> see<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
you can drop it so as you can see the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.010 
you can drop it so as you can see the
fraction<00:04:12.280> 1/4<00:04:12.910> can<00:04:13.180> be<00:04:13.330> written<00:04:13.510> as<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> decimal

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
fraction 1/4 can be written as a decimal

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.710 
fraction 1/4 can be written as a decimal
25<00:04:14.740> hundredths<00:04:15.400> which<00:04:16.060> can<00:04:16.239> then<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.570> written

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
25 hundredths which can then be written

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.650 
25 hundredths which can then be written
as<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.960> percent<00:04:17.380> 25<00:04:17.680> percent<00:04:18.239> what<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.420> means

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
as a percent 25 percent what this means

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.900 
as a percent 25 percent what this means
is<00:04:19.840> that<00:04:19.870> fraction<00:04:20.500> decimal<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.280> percent

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
is that fraction decimal and percent

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.610 
is that fraction decimal and percent
numbers<00:04:22.270> are<00:04:22.480> actually<00:04:23.110> just<00:04:23.350> three

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
numbers are actually just three

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.560 
numbers are actually just three
different<00:04:24.010> ways<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.430> write<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.850> same<00:04:24.880> thing

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
different ways to write the same thing

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.170 
different ways to write the same thing
so<00:04:26.470> how<00:04:26.620> would<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.800> change<00:04:27.130> 7,500<00:04:28.000> stew<00:04:28.150> a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
so how would you change 7,500 stew a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.330 
so how would you change 7,500 stew a
percent<00:04:28.600> burping<00:04:29.260> well<00:04:29.620> that's<00:04:29.830> easy<00:04:30.130> you

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
percent burping well that's easy you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.830 
percent burping well that's easy you
move<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.610> decimal<00:04:30.640> two<00:04:31.150> places<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.720> right

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
move the decimal two places to the right

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.530 
move the decimal two places to the right
and<00:04:32.290> attach<00:04:32.560> a<00:04:32.650> percent<00:04:33.010> symbol<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.419> can

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
and attach a percent symbol and you can

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.040 
and attach a percent symbol and you can
drop<00:04:34.690> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
drop the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.719 
drop the
point<00:04:35.440> when<00:04:35.620> you're<00:04:35.800> finished<00:04:36.159> because<00:04:36.310> at

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
point when you're finished because at

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.700 
point when you're finished because at
the<00:04:36.940> end<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.240> whole<00:04:37.389> number<00:04:37.720> how<00:04:38.169> about<00:04:38.440> five

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the end of a whole number how about five

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.010 
the end of a whole number how about five
tenths<00:04:39.069> well<00:04:40.060> I'm<00:04:40.180> guessing<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.690> you<00:04:40.840> have

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
tenths well I'm guessing that you have

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.809 
tenths well I'm guessing that you have
to<00:04:41.199> add<00:04:41.319> a<00:04:41.349> zero<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.069> five<00:04:42.280> tenths<00:04:42.669> in

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
to add a zero to the five tenths in

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.249 
to add a zero to the five tenths in
order<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.150> move<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.449> decimal<00:04:43.629> point<00:04:43.990> two

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
order to move the decimal point two

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.140 
order to move the decimal point two
places<00:04:44.289> to<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.860> right<00:04:44.949> then<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.550> attach<00:04:46.030> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
places to the right then you attach a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.820 
places to the right then you attach a
percent<00:04:46.539> symbol<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.110> drop<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.440> decimal

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
percent symbol and drop the decimal

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.290 
percent symbol and drop the decimal
point<00:04:48.069> because<00:04:48.370> it's<00:04:48.520> at<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.759> end<00:04:48.879> of<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.120> whole

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
point because it's at the end of a whole

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.510 
point because it's at the end of a whole
number<00:04:49.599> now<00:04:50.440> let's<00:04:50.710> look<00:04:50.830> at<00:04:50.979> fractional

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
number now let's look at fractional

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.309 
number now let's look at fractional
percent<00:04:51.669> numbers<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.479> decimal<00:04:53.169> percent

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
percent numbers and decimal percent

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.949 
percent numbers and decimal percent
numbers
