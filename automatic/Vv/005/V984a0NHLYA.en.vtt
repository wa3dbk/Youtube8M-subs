other characters are just controlled by

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
other characters are just controlled by
the<00:01:33.960> AI<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.770> pretty<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.460> mean<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.729> pretty

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the AI so it's pretty I mean it's pretty

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.819 
the AI so it's pretty I mean it's pretty
simple<00:01:36.299> they've<00:01:36.990> worked<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> way

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
simple they've worked it out in a way

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.050 
simple they've worked it out in a way
where<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.369> gonna<00:01:38.520> work<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
where I think it's gonna work and I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
where I think it's gonna work and I
actually<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.689> like<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> graphics<00:01:40.350> there

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
actually really like the graphics there

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
actually really like the graphics there
have<00:01:40.799> been<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.189> people<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.850> forums<00:01:42.780> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
have been a lot of people on forums and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
have been a lot of people on forums and
what<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.380> being<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.890> Oh<00:01:44.040> graphics<00:01:44.820> are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
what not being like Oh graphics are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.749 
what not being like Oh graphics are
Creole<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.680> big<00:01:46.829> into<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.579> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
Creole I'm not really big into it but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.280 
Creole I'm not really big into it but
it's<00:01:47.880> definitely<00:01:48.090> true<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> Dragon<00:01:49.140> Quest

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it's definitely true to the Dragon Quest

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.610 
it's definitely true to the Dragon Quest
original<00:01:49.799> style<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.640> um

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
original style so um

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.350 
original style so um
not<00:01:51.710> something<00:01:52.040> that's<00:01:52.190> super<00:01:52.550> popular<00:01:52.820> now

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
not something that's super popular now

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.170 
not something that's super popular now
but<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.620> will<00:01:54.770> make<00:01:55.070> Dragon<00:01:55.520> Quest<00:01:55.670> fans<00:01:55.940> very

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
but it will make Dragon Quest fans very

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.820 
but it will make Dragon Quest fans very
happy<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.930> think<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.290> they've<00:01:57.410> kind<00:01:57.740> of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
happy and I think that they've kind of

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.010 
happy and I think that they've kind of
come<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.370> midpoint<00:01:58.730> with<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.900> very

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
come to a midpoint with it that's very

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.740 
come to a midpoint with it that's very
nice<00:02:00.500> oh<00:02:00.830> also<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.580> sounds<00:02:01.760> like<00:02:02.120> in<00:02:02.420> online

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
nice oh also it sounds like in online

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.190 
nice oh also it sounds like in online
mode<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.350> might<00:02:03.500> have<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.860> pay<00:02:04.120> which<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.690> not

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
mode you might have to pay which is not

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.930 
mode you might have to pay which is not
something<00:02:06.410> that<00:02:06.530> any<00:02:06.800> of<00:02:06.980> us<00:02:07.100> like<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.400> hear<00:02:07.760> so

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
something that any of us like to hear so

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.290 
something that any of us like to hear so
that<00:02:08.090> makes<00:02:08.300> sense<00:02:08.570> also<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.490> concern<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.120> I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
that makes sense also the concern that I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180 
that makes sense also the concern that I
would<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.840> with<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> game<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.560> general<00:02:12.800> is

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
would have with the game in general is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.430 
would have with the game in general is
that<00:02:13.640> since<00:02:14.270> they've<00:02:14.480> made<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.350> you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
that since they've made it so that you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.990 
that since they've made it so that you
can<00:02:15.590> interchangeably<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.880> know

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
can interchangeably have you know

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.770 
can interchangeably have you know
whatever<00:02:17.740> characters<00:02:18.760> people<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.090> are<00:02:20.210> IRL

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
whatever characters people that are IRL

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.600
