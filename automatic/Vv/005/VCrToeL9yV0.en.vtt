00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
been checking in and what we're looking

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.830 
been checking in and what we're looking
at<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.570> are<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> pair<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.199> 23<00:00:16.770> inch<00:00:16.949> monitors

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
at here are a pair of 23 inch monitors

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.090 
at here are a pair of 23 inch monitors
specifically<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> 23-10<00:00:19.770> ii<00:00:19.830> which

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
specifically this is a 23-10 ii which

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
specifically this is a 23-10 ii which
we've<00:00:20.279> written<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.760> bunch<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.830> LED

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we've written about a bunch it's LED

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
we've written about a bunch it's LED
backlit<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.699> means<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.240> slim<00:00:24.840> light

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
backlit so that means it's slim light

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.870 
backlit so that means it's slim light
and<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.890> bright<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.310> check<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.609> how<00:00:26.670> thin

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and really bright now check out how thin

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.540 
and really bright now check out how thin
this<00:00:27.029> guy<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:28.070> managed<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> compact

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
this guy is right managed to compact

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
this guy is right managed to compact
everything<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.029> need<00:00:30.210> into<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.380> thin

recently revealed is the X 2301 this guy
which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.770> thinner<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.750> has<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> little

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
which is thinner so little has a little

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.540 
which is thinner so little has a little
bit<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.500> sleek<00:00:43.739> styling<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> base

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
bit more sleek styling to it in the base

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
bit more sleek styling to it in the base
and<00:00:44.850> I'll<00:00:45.629> show<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.050> differences<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and I'll show you more differences in a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.750 
and I'll show you more differences in a
second<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.370> give<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> little

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.060 
context here's a pen just to show you
how<00:00:50.550> thick<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.649> all<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
how thick this thing is all right you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.209 
how thick this thing is all right you
can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.390> comparison<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
can see that now by comparison if the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
can see that now by comparison if the
pen<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.670> looks<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.719> thicker<00:00:58.379> than

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pen actually looks pretty thicker than

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
pen actually looks pretty thicker than
the<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.280> screen<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.090> 2301<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:02.510> let's<00:01:03.510> talk

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the the screen on the 2301 so let's talk

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
the the screen on the 2301 so let's talk
about<00:01:03.719> what's<00:01:04.199> what's<00:01:04.439> new<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> 2301

for now on this guy to take a break ok
catch<00:01:11.570> time<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> close-up<00:01:14.090> let's<00:01:15.090> get

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
catch time for the close-up let's get

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.520 
catch time for the close-up let's get
some<00:01:15.420> meat<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.600> potato<00:01:15.930> stuff<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
way it's a 1920 x 1080 monitor it has

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.469 
way it's a 1920 x 1080 monitor it has
three<00:01:21.840> milliseconds<00:01:22.140> response<00:01:22.830> time<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.479> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
three milliseconds response time and it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
three milliseconds response time and it
just<00:01:24.810> plays<00:01:25.259> well<00:01:25.619> i<00:01:25.650> mean<00:01:25.830> i<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.220> testing<00:01:26.640> out

of the stuff is traditionally put on the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
of the stuff is traditionally put on the
monitor<00:01:43.140> behind<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> shoved<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
monitor behind it is shoved into the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.880 
monitor behind it is shoved into the
base<00:01:45.450> allowing<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> screen<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.740> only

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
base allowing for the screen to be only

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.440 
base allowing for the screen to be only
nine<00:01:47.159> point<00:01:47.460> eight<00:01:47.549> millimeters<00:01:47.970> deep

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.300 

concluding<00:01:51.450> our<00:01:51.570> toward<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.899> 2301<00:01:52.500> let's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
concluding our toward the 2301 let's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
concluding our toward the 2301 let's
focus<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> base<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.149> closer<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
focus on the base a little closer so

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.480 
focus on the base a little closer so
right<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.619> cool<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.189> lip

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
right here we have this cool little lip

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.130 
right here we have this cool little lip
around<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.969> nice<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.509> styling<00:01:57.899> going

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
around it and nice little styling going
