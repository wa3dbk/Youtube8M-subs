pencils for more precise erasing you can

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.099 
pencils for more precise erasing you can
use<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.920> vinyl<00:00:14.219> eraser<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.179> will<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.900> drawing

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
use a vinyl eraser I will be drawing

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.050 
use a vinyl eraser I will be drawing
this<00:00:16.320> water<00:00:16.619> bottle<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.369> cubist<00:00:17.699> form

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
this water bottle in a cubist form

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
this water bottle in a cubist form
alright<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.109> start<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.010> draw

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
alright to start I'm just going to draw

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.310 
alright to start I'm just going to draw
a<00:00:20.220> simple<00:00:20.490> contour<00:00:21.060> drawing<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.140> water

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
a simple contour drawing of the water

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.710 
a simple contour drawing of the water
bottle<00:00:22.939> it's<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> most<00:00:24.240> basic<00:00:24.449> forms<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:27.570> what

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
bottle it's the most basic forms so what

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.370 
bottle it's the most basic forms so what
keep<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> cubism<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:29.130> all<00:00:29.250> about

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
keep in the cubism was really all about

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.260 
keep in the cubism was really all about
with<00:00:31.380> seeing<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> object<00:00:32.309> from<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.090> many

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
with seeing the object from as many

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.340 
with seeing the object from as many
sides<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.750> possible

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
sides as possible

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.080 
sides as possible
and<00:00:34.820> thinking<00:00:35.820> about<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> different<00:00:36.420> ways

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
and thinking about it in different ways

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.280 
and thinking about it in different ways
so<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.210> you're<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> want<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
so what you're going to want to do is

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.119 
so what you're going to want to do is
double<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> lines<00:00:41.250> you've<00:00:41.430> already<00:00:41.610> made

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
double up on lines you've already made

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
double up on lines you've already made
these<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> placed<00:00:44.700> around<00:00:44.910> really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
these can be placed around really

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.729 
these can be placed around really
wherever<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.320> fit

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
wherever you see fit

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
wherever you see fit
it's<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.879> important<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> place

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it's not so important where you place

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.750 
it's not so important where you place
the<00:00:49.440> thing<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.280> you're<00:00:50.430> thinking

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the thing as just if you're thinking

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.920 
the thing as just if you're thinking
about<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> bottle<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.449> you're<00:00:51.570> making<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
about the bottle as you're making the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.189 
about the bottle as you're making the
lines<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> Cubist<00:00:53.760> masters<00:00:54.239> you'd<00:00:54.840> find<00:00:55.050> they

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
lines the Cubist masters you'd find they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
lines the Cubist masters you'd find they
would<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.500> connecting<00:00:55.920> things<00:00:56.160> almost<00:00:56.520> at

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
would be connecting things almost at

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.580 
would be connecting things almost at
random<00:00:56.940> using<00:00:57.539> horizontal<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.260> vertical

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
random using horizontal and vertical

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:07.640 
random using horizontal and vertical
lines<00:01:03.680> I'm<00:01:04.680> going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> take<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.220> eraser<00:01:06.650> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
lines I'm going to take my eraser and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.810 
lines I'm going to take my eraser and
then<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.100> remove<00:01:08.280> some<00:01:08.340> lines<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
then I'm going to remove some lines that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
then I'm going to remove some lines that
I'm<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.119> crazy<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.950> again<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> should

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I'm not crazy about again this should

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
I'm not crazy about again this should
just<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.490> chosen<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:11.970> random<00:01:12.860> there's<00:01:13.860> no<00:01:14.010> real

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
just be chosen at random there's no real

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.330 
just be chosen at random there's no real
formula<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:15.710> then<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.950> back<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
formula here then you go back in and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.240 
formula here then you go back in and
draw<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:17.970> more<00:01:18.979> maybe<00:01:19.979> draw<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
draw a little bit more maybe draw the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.020 
draw a little bit more maybe draw the
bottle<00:01:20.549> again<00:01:22.159> right<00:01:23.159> over<00:01:23.189> top<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bottle again right over top of what you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
bottle again right over top of what you
already<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> quick<00:01:25.860> or

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
already got this can be a quick or

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.179 
already got this can be a quick or
unless<00:01:26.220> complete<00:01:26.640> drawings<00:01:27.770> again<00:01:28.770> more<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
unless complete drawings again more of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.100 
unless complete drawings again more of
these<00:01:29.369> connecting<00:01:29.790> lines<00:01:32.540> now<00:01:33.540> shading<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
these connecting lines now shading was a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.460 
these connecting lines now shading was a
very<00:01:34.380> important<00:01:34.860> part<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> cubism<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
very important part of cubism and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.660 
very important part of cubism and
shading<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.560> done<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> several<00:01:38.189> ways<00:01:38.340> often

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
shading was done in several ways often

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
shading was done in several ways often
with<00:01:38.970> charcoal<00:01:39.390> pencils<00:01:39.750> like<00:01:39.869> these<00:01:40.049> there

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
with charcoal pencils like these there

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.310 
with charcoal pencils like these there
was<00:01:41.100> cross<00:01:41.340> hatching

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.230 

and<00:01:45.800> there<00:01:46.430> was<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.550> technique<00:01:46.910> known<00:01:47.000> as

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
and there was a technique known as

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.930 
and there was a technique known as
stippling<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.740> further<00:01:49.040> away<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.370> get<00:01:49.700> from

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
stippling the further away you get from

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.410 
stippling the further away you get from
the<00:01:50.840> source<00:01:51.080> where<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.380> want<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:51.770> shadow

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the source where you want your shadow

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.740 
the source where you want your shadow
the<00:01:53.420> looser<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.140> pattern<00:01:54.410> of<00:01:54.500> dots<00:01:54.620> becomes

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the looser the pattern of dots becomes

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.120 
the looser the pattern of dots becomes
to<00:01:56.750> really<00:01:56.990> get<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.200> texture<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.860> look

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
to really get the texture and the look

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.740 
to really get the texture and the look
that<00:01:58.430> I'd<00:01:58.550> want<00:01:58.730> I<00:01:58.880> need<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.240> sit<00:01:59.420> here<00:01:59.540> doing

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
that I'd want I need to sit here doing

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.060 
that I'd want I need to sit here doing
this<00:01:59.810> for<00:02:00.020> quite<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.230> while<00:02:00.410> but<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:00.890> see

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
this for quite a while but you can see

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.280 
this for quite a while but you can see
that<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.310> does<00:02:01.490> fill<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.900> I'm<00:02:03.020> going<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.170> go

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
that it does fill and I'm going to go

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.930 
that it does fill and I'm going to go
back<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.800> just<00:02:03.920> fill<00:02:04.070> some<00:02:04.220> areas<00:02:04.400> loosely

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.730 

this<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.090> about<00:02:08.270> finding<00:02:08.540> shapes<00:02:08.929> you're

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
this is about finding shapes you're

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.020 
this is about finding shapes you're
looking<00:02:09.979> around<00:02:10.100> seeing<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.790> lines

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
looking around seeing all the lines

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.180 
looking around seeing all the lines
you've<00:02:11.240> made<00:02:11.390> they've<00:02:11.600> converged<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you've made they've converged and the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.520 
you've made they've converged and the
shapes<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.640> formed<00:02:13.960> all<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.230> shading

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
shapes that have formed all the shading

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.960 
shapes that have formed all the shading
is<00:02:15.620> doing<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.070> making<00:02:16.340> them<00:02:16.520> stand<00:02:16.820> out

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
is doing is really making them stand out

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.430 
is doing is really making them stand out
in<00:02:17.480> a<00:02:17.540> way<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.840> they<00:02:17.930> didn't<00:02:18.230> before<00:02:20.440> another

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
in a way that they didn't before another

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.540 
in a way that they didn't before another
technique<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:21.920> was<00:02:22.190> often<00:02:23.060> used<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.450> cubism

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
technique that was often used in cubism

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
technique that was often used in cubism
it's<00:02:25.550> just<00:02:25.760> shading<00:02:26.030> something<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:28.040> letting

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's just shading something and letting

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.360 
it's just shading something and letting
the<00:02:28.459> shade<00:02:28.670> shaking<00:02:29.209> loosen<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.140> go<00:02:30.260> away

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the shade shaking loosen as you go away

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.130 
the shade shaking loosen as you go away
even<00:02:31.370> smudging<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.540> use<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:32.780> finger

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
even smudging it you can use your finger

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.630 
even smudging it you can use your finger
or<00:02:34.750> paper<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.990> do<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.230> trick<00:02:36.470> with<00:02:36.680> smudging

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
or paper to do this trick with smudging

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.490 
or paper to do this trick with smudging
your<00:02:38.420> shading<00:02:38.750> doesn't<00:02:39.020> really<00:02:39.200> need<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.410> be

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
your shading doesn't really need to be

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710 
your shading doesn't really need to be
in<00:02:39.590> any<00:02:39.739> pattern<00:02:39.950> at<00:02:40.220> all<00:02:40.370> when<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.330> smudge<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
in any pattern at all when you smudge it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.130 
in any pattern at all when you smudge it
out<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.140> lines<00:02:42.350> disappear<00:02:42.590> or<00:02:42.980> somewhat

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.240 

alright<00:02:48.140> well<00:02:48.320> I've<00:02:48.440> been<00:02:48.530> going<00:02:48.800> along<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
alright well I've been going along and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.940 
alright well I've been going along and
developing<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> drawing<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.090> little<00:02:50.300> bit<00:02:50.420> more

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
developing the drawing a little bit more

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.229 
developing the drawing a little bit more
just<00:02:51.950> adding<00:02:52.250> shading<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.790> few<00:02:52.970> extra

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
just adding shading and a few extra

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.449 
just adding shading and a few extra
lines<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.630> bring<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.900> details<00:02:54.370> remember<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
lines to bring out details remember the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.860 
lines to bring out details remember the
most<00:02:55.610> important<00:02:56.120> thing<00:02:56.269> is<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.630> keep

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
most important thing is just to keep

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.170 
most important thing is just to keep
cutting<00:02:57.110> things<00:02:57.440> up<00:02:57.620> into<00:02:58.580> pieces<00:02:58.760> into

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
cutting things up into pieces into

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.750 
cutting things up into pieces into
segments<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.980> this<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.370> idea<00:03:01.610> behind

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
segments and this is the idea behind

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.280 
segments and this is the idea behind
cubism<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.570> really<00:03:02.750> get<00:03:02.900> around<00:03:03.170> an

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
cubism just to really get around an

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.530 
cubism just to really get around an
object<00:03:03.910> if<00:03:04.910> you're<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.239> then<00:03:05.330> try

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
object if you're now and then try

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.910 
object if you're now and then try
repeating<00:03:05.840> something<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> just<00:03:06.709> did

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
repeating something that you just did

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.870 
repeating something that you just did
adding<00:03:07.519> it<00:03:07.610> somewhere<00:03:07.850> else<00:03:09.549> I'm<00:03:10.549> going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.760> go

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
adding it somewhere else I'm going to go

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.560 
adding it somewhere else I'm going to go
one<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.209> time<00:03:11.330> with<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:13.390> what<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.420> is

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
one more time with that what that is

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.780 
one more time with that what that is
doing<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.769> your<00:03:15.920> drawing<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.280> adding<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.610> layer

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
doing and your drawing is adding a layer

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.090 
doing and your drawing is adding a layer
of<00:03:16.940> depth<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:18.410> your<00:03:18.530> drawing<00:03:18.650> would<00:03:18.860> not

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
of depth that your drawing would not

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.440 
of depth that your drawing would not
have<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:19.670> were<00:03:19.760> actually<00:03:19.880> just<00:03:20.090> trying<00:03:20.360> to

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
have if you were actually just trying to

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.180 
have if you were actually just trying to
draw<00:03:20.660> a<00:03:20.690> representation<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.530> bottle<00:03:21.830> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
draw a representation of a bottle just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.460 
draw a representation of a bottle just
come<00:03:22.430> along<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.730> little<00:03:23.000> further<00:03:23.330> more<00:03:24.080> shading

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
come along a little further more shading

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:36.440 
come along a little further more shading
more<00:03:25.040> breaking<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.549> shapes

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.640 

all<00:03:37.450> right<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:37.780> hopefully<00:03:38.109> I've<00:03:38.230> given<00:03:38.349> you

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
all right so hopefully I've given you

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.309 
all right so hopefully I've given you
the<00:03:38.799> idea<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:39.849> you<00:03:39.969> can<00:03:40.120> grab<00:03:40.299> any<00:03:40.629> object<00:03:41.170> if

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
the idea that you can grab any object if

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.959 
the idea that you can grab any object if
you're<00:03:41.469> interested<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:41.980> cubism<00:03:42.489> or<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:42.969 
you're interested in cubism or the

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:44.640 
you're interested in cubism or the
artist<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.540> style<00:03:43.750> behind<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.230> look<00:03:44.500> at

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
artist and the style behind it look at

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.869 
artist and the style behind it look at
it<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> different<00:03:44.980> way<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.489> you<00:03:45.579> can<00:03:45.700> make<00:03:45.849> a

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
it in a different way and you can make a

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.099 
it in a different way and you can make a
drawing<00:03:46.209> that's<00:03:46.359> interesting<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.019> unique

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
drawing that's interesting and unique

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.250 
drawing that's interesting and unique
out<00:03:47.439> of<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:49.180> has<00:03:49.239> been<00:03:49.599> Aaron<00:03:49.930> Wimmer<00:03:50.109> and
