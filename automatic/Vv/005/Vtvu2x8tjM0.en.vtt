00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.820
 allo we are here in meyrin in the subs 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.610
 borgini goes in the box in favor of vic 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.609
 be worth lee david alward by enrico 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:25.140
 colantoni any model of habsheim down 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.600
 and they have time is running horse 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.030
 jumping horse watch is so we speak 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.610
 Because it is very nice and very special 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.600
 not so easy to do complications under 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 the tag tweet their jumping it's a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 instant change now that so 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.629
 trailing them we were going to guide desert 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.149
 who walks quietly and for example 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.559
 at 10:30 she will be going out between 2 10 and the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 11 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.679
 while jumping them she will pass 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 directly from 10 / the eleven 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.579
 time change more compare 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.860
 it's a sportsman who will walk or 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.299
 run normally while the one who 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 must jump over a bar he's going 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.799
 having to take a pulse weapons and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.469
 the springs and give everything at the end 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.659
 to go over the obstacle so 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.549
 their jumping is pretty much the same 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.979
 thing for an hour there is a system 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.100
 equipped with springs that will arm themselves and which 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.530
 will disarm instantly in one 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.149
 fraction of a second the trailing system 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.909
 it requires a gear train 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.799
 finally while the jumping system 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.200
 will require a more gear wheel brake 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.420
 age arms springs and jumpers 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.289
 positioning the accumulation 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 energy 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.020
 it will be done precisely during a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.929
 hour so well before the jump it's 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.090
 obvious that the first minutes 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.680
 of energy accumulation its not asking 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.710
 a lot of effort because we weapons 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.150
 a spring in these first bases but 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 the more we approach the end the more 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.020
 spring is armed and the harder it is to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.240
 the army is like an arc 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 at first you shoot the arrow it's 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.050
 simple plus you get to the end more 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.430
 it's hard we trigger it there is a 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:18.910
 trailing system that turn him into 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.030
 same time as the spring sarm with a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.730
 and at the moment of relaxation and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.680
 who will spend his long jump 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.050
 he will leave and there he will release 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.489
 the energy in the system is launched there 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.580
 there is an inertia who leaves and there he 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.180
 must again a jumper that will come 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.690
 stop the system at the end of the race 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.250
 so this long necklace during tears age we go 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.760
 to make sure that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.600
 disarm for at the time of release which 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.760
 do not hold back the souk either 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.980
 so he's let go he lets go 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.130
 he falls back and he stops it's a 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.380
 complication it's not easy although 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 when we see the watch work that 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.329
 may seem simple but 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.489
 but it's not at the bottom it's not 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.370
 at all in fact we are waiting for the moment of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.459
 jump in the last minute before the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.370
 change of time we observe and we love 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.780
 see this mechanical system that allows 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.120
 crazy speed 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.489
 the two victories the day before match 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.959
 technicality and complexity of being 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:31.139
 used in fact is watching you bind this 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.590
 system of the made in just wii of which it is 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.049
 an imperative the seal of beasts 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.329
 change of time had to be his time 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.599
 and it turned out that for the 2nd 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.180
 bath complications of the numbers that get 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.709
 cross and align themselves it's the same 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.030
 it could not be and not because 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.919
 for a period of time we would have 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 all the numbers that intersect on 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.030
 knew more about them than he was so he 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.079
 should also be instantaneous it's 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.299
 according to the idea that their jumping 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.689
 mechanically imposes it's great 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.510
 interesting for us who are assembling them 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.549
 everyone is happy too 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.049
 well the watchmaker who goes the assembly that 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.049
 the customer who will say their top
