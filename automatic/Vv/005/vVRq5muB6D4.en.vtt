yeah<00:01:38.990> especially<00:01:39.990> when<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.530> took<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> loss<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

water<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> next<00:01:42.600> song<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.930> think

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
she's relaxed once again you'll be able

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.880 
she's relaxed once again you'll be able
to<00:02:57.810> keep<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.110> balance<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.530> want<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> lock

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
to keep your balance you want the lock
