cool<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> pen<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> low<00:01:06.390> gear<00:01:06.630> ratio

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
cool about the pen is the low gear ratio

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
cool about the pen is the low gear ratio
is<00:01:07.260> two<00:01:07.979> point<00:01:08.250> eight<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.700> you're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is two point eight to one so you're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190
