over to image adjust now this is where

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.529 
over to image adjust now this is where
you<00:05:09.949> can<00:05:10.159> change<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:10.789> different<00:05:11.210> pixel

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
you can change the different pixel

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.209 
you can change the different pixel
aspect<00:05:11.689> ratios<00:05:12.319> currently<00:05:12.740> i<00:05:12.770> have<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.009> set<00:05:13.039> to

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:13.219 
aspect ratios currently i have it set to

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.510 
aspect ratios currently i have it set to
fit<00:05:13.490> all<00:05:13.870> we've<00:05:14.870> got<00:05:15.080> 1<00:05:15.439> 21<00:05:15.800> which<00:05:15.830> would<00:05:16.219> zoom

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
fit all we've got 1 21 which would zoom

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.649 
fit all we've got 1 21 which would zoom
in<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.229> current<00:05:19.039> pixel<00:05:19.400> output<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.419> the

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
in to the current pixel output that the

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.290 
in to the current pixel output that the
amount<00:05:21.020> or<00:05:21.319> whatever<00:05:21.620> your<00:05:21.770> your<00:05:22.189> source<00:05:23.060> is

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
amount or whatever your your source is

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.589 
amount or whatever your your source is
kicking<00:05:23.719> out<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.080> if<00:05:24.199> it's<00:05:24.349> vga<00:05:24.770> or<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:26.029> it's<00:05:26.180> HD

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
kicking out so if it's vga or if it's HD

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.110 
kicking out so if it's vga or if it's HD
if<00:05:26.810> save<00:05:27.050> it's<00:05:27.229> 1080p<00:05:27.469> you'll<00:05:28.400> go<00:05:28.610> one<00:05:28.819> to<00:05:28.969> one

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
if save it's 1080p you'll go one to one

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.490 
if save it's 1080p you'll go one to one
so<00:05:29.330> each<00:05:29.479> pixel<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:31.150> 1414<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.659> current<00:05:33.199> pixel

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
so each pixel is 1414 the current pixel

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.240 
so each pixel is 1414 the current pixel
of<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:34.069> monitor<00:05:34.699> and<00:05:35.139> then<00:05:36.139> if<00:05:36.409> we<00:05:36.529> go<00:05:36.680> down<00:05:36.710> we

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
of the monitor and then if we go down we

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.379 
of the monitor and then if we go down we
have<00:05:37.690> one<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.810> one<00:05:38.990> Phil<00:05:39.440> aspect<00:05:40.009> ratio<00:05:40.400> for

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
have one to one Phil aspect ratio for

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.209 
have one to one Phil aspect ratio for
three<00:05:41.719> or<00:05:41.990> 16<00:05:42.830> 10<00:05:43.240> 15<00:05:44.240> 9<00:05:44.479> or<00:05:44.779> 69<00:05:45.229> so<00:05:45.589> these<00:05:45.740> have

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
three or 16 10 15 9 or 69 so these have

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.159 
three or 16 10 15 9 or 69 so these have
plenty<00:05:46.669> of<00:05:46.699> options<00:05:46.819> for<00:05:47.449> depending<00:05:47.839> on<00:05:47.930> what

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
plenty of options for depending on what

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.869 
plenty of options for depending on what
type<00:05:48.349> of<00:05:48.379> input<00:05:48.740> that<00:05:49.099> you're<00:05:49.219> kicking<00:05:49.580> into

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
type of input that you're kicking into

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.529 
type of input that you're kicking into
the<00:05:50.330> monitor<00:05:50.690> we<00:05:51.529> also<00:05:51.680> have<00:05:51.800> anamorphic<00:05:52.539> in

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
the monitor we also have anamorphic in

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.760 
the monitor we also have anamorphic in
different<00:05:53.960> settings<00:05:54.110> to<00:05:54.620> 35<00:05:55.069> and<00:05:55.400> 185<00:05:56.029> and

different settings to 35 and 185 and

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.959 
different settings to 35 and 185 and
then<00:05:57.770> we're<00:05:57.979> going<00:05:58.099> to<00:05:58.159> go<00:05:58.279> back<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.490> fill<00:05:58.789> out

that I love about the HD five is that

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.330 
that I love about the HD five is that
Phil<00:06:48.810> all<00:06:49.110> feature<00:06:49.500> that<00:06:49.770> we<00:06:49.890> showed<00:06:50.100> you<00:06:50.250> in

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
Phil all feature that we showed you in

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.220 
the menu settings and I'll show you an
example<00:06:52.410> when<00:06:53.250> we<00:06:53.280> hit<00:06:53.490> record<00:06:54.230> the

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
example when we hit record the

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.920 
example when we hit record the
resolution<00:06:55.890> still<00:06:56.580> fills<00:06:57.120> the<00:06:57.420> screen<00:06:57.660> this

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930

is<00:06:57.990> really<00:06:58.500> really<00:06:58.650> handy<00:06:58.980> because<00:06:59.280> typically

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
is really really handy because typically

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.590 
is really really handy because typically
the<00:07:00.890> standard<00:07:01.890> def<00:07:02.010> output<00:07:02.550> would<00:07:02.760> be<00:07:03.150> very

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
the standard def output would be very

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.570 
the standard def output would be very
very<00:07:03.810> small<00:07:04.200> be<00:07:04.470> almost<00:07:04.620> smaller<00:07:05.070> than<00:07:05.310> it<00:07:05.460> is

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
very small be almost smaller than it is

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.600 
very small be almost smaller than it is
on<00:07:05.610> the<00:07:05.790> back<00:07:05.940> of<00:07:05.970> your<00:07:06.270> LCD<00:07:06.600> screen<00:07:06.990> of<00:07:07.200> your

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
and have that fill all option enabled it

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.300 
and have that fill all option enabled it
automatically<00:07:13.350> fills<00:07:13.380> the<00:07:13.800> screen<00:07:14.010> it's

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
automatically fills the screen it's

still<00:07:14.490> a<00:07:14.520> standard<00:07:14.910> def<00:07:15.060> output<00:07:15.540> but<00:07:16.050> this<00:07:16.140> is

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
still a standard def output but this is

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.320 
still a standard def output but this is
a<00:07:16.380> lot<00:07:16.650> easier<00:07:16.680> to<00:07:17.280> control<00:07:17.460> your<00:07:17.730> focus<00:07:17.940> with

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.310 
and its really really handy it's one
