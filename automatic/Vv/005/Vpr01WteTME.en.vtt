00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.280
 no 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.900
 bm 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.900
 the more we 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.159
 we must pass without excess 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.159
 so I often say with creatures to the feet 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.179
 but things go kyle xy have appendages especially forward that is 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.260
 subject to look like the Gaullists 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.800
 the purpose of the operation 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's just having a benefit that has turned it backwards instead of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 to go forward 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 after launching after filing their 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.520
 also at the level of 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.520
 opposition 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.110
 he must land 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 the army is worth 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.060
 so the restorer that I had 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.520
 he's going to put himself in a vertical position and he's brought back 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.760
 in this sense 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.280
 for ever who actually go down like that 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 so these different presentations 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.100
 so to do this morgan does 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.780
 their will to do much better than the man are left without 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780
 present like this to present it in the sense 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 in mounting taxes and classic sound 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.450
 we take the measure of their country does not dark 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 so the food afp I'll watch this to do 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.760
 that's like samantha defined 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.410
 so now buying that meets party 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 it is bordered the strong movements two other clues 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.430
 the player will land on the bottom in this way so it's a montage 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.910
 very loud she presented on a little bit different that sometimes can do the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.010
 difference
