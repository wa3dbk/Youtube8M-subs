00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:09.769
 Good day, it's Elena Terekhova today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:15.440
 April 27 and I seated cucumber seedlings 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 how do i make my seedlings i take de 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.910
 wooden box so filling it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 sawdust 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:31.309
 These are the abilities I spill them with boiling water 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:36.780
 brick boiling water then when cool 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:41.700
 cool this soil do the holes and sow 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 my cucumbers cucumbers i sow dry then 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 so here I close and covers and all 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.440
 cellophane film we so cucumbers 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 stand until germinate and as 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 germination then look 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 primer and add some water watered and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.010
 again the practice is covered with a film and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.840
 here is April 16 to today's 27 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.570
 day so grown up and seedling cucumbers 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:19.729
 I sow cucumbers and try many different varieties 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:23.280
 and therefore I do like this then take 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.740
 plastic cups do 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.340
 necessarily holes in them hole business 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.340
 not from below, but here, here, on the side , here 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.360
 such holes do not allow water to immediately 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.920
 ran down and then fill with soil a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.950
 take the soil 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:47.549
 your land from the garden and I still take peat 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.640
 For seedlings, I mix it in half 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.149
 probably fill the glass with this soil 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 take seedlings and see which ones 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.369
 ideal roots 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.189
 that's it in sawdust can be neatly 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.310
 so here's a pull out 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.479
 look at what root system 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.360
 chic 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.910
 neatly put in your cup 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:22.190
 here like this without taking and what 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.860
 and neatly add zemlyku 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.250
 dialogue zemelku 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 around of course with both hands of it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.540
 get better 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.810
 hand is not very fill cup 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.410
 the ground is nothing I do not like this trampling 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.620
 slightly shaken so as not to spoil 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.150
 roots 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.440
 they are very gentle and then field 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.290
 boiled cold water 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 neatly spilling this thing like this 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.769
 and of course they are a little sick but 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.660
 then look the next day they 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.920
 they stand like good soldiers 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.970
 strong seedlings 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.680
 and then she grows up with us and when 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.910
 weather permits 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:28.560
 and we have it in Latvia around May 21. I 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:31.260
 I plant cucumbers in the ground usually 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.380
 Sow greenhouse 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.989
 pantene varieties and we walk karmically and 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.630
 and get the first early cucumbers in others 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:46.620
 the video I shot is shown as what 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:51.060
 What kind of greenhouses and what crop are obtained? 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.959
 further subtlety in growing everything to 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.500
 dating 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.329
 bye bye everyone grow success 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.049
 early cucumbers are very healthy before 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.049
 dating
