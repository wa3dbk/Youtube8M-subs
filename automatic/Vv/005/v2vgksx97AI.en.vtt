00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Now all of you are welcome to me 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.740
 channel today I bring you one of my breakfasts 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.740
 healthy 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.760
 today I have prepared oatmeal you need a 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.880
 bucket of this size more or less I have 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.250
 put 300 milliliters of soy milk 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.160
 without added sugars but you can 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.410
 use the milk that you best look like 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.180
 and the amount then that which can also 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.600
 vary depending on a little of your 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.190
 caloric needs 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.710
 have put 50 grams 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.280
 everyone will also need 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 stevia sweeteners in this case 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.980
 cinnamon branch 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.980
 cinnamon powder 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.560
 I used this almond cream 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.020
 to add good fats so breakfast 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.010
 but if you do not have always you can put 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.210
 chopped nuts too 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.600
 and finally fruit hydrated 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.299
 no sugar added to decorate by 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 over and to give it more flavor and good 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.500
 result has been this 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.770
 plus the rumba that prepares already ready for 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.890
 eat it as soon as I finish recording and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.540
 above them Paul varied a little 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.610
 of cinnamon and I have put pieces of 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 fruit is dehydrated I have been 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.620
 pretty thick I'm not what you can see 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.110
 there but good consistency a little 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.210
 in a matter of taste and here this already 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.030
 it depends on you I think it has already been 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.900
 put the bucket with about 300 milliliters of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.890
 milk and the cinnamon stick in ramona 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.080
 stirring all the time so that it does not 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.450
 paste until it has started to boil and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.170
 then you are adding 250 grams of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.200
 oatmeal and the trickle of stevia and also 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.200
 I have put a teaspoon of coffee 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.190
 Almond cream and nothing we have removed 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.400
 all during a good time remove 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.179
 constantly so that it does not stick and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.679
 when it is not there is that the thickness of the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.840
 cream is 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.269
 is what we like because nothing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 you do it and just the derbies in a 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.560
 Bol and I got married I got cinnamon 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.819
 this is cinnamon bio ground a little bit 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.450
 over sprinkled and the requirements of 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.730
 fruit that they already tell you is from Christ 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 Well strawberry without added sugar and also 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.500
 another one is a little bit of raspberry 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 that is pretty sweet and makes me give it 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.620
 wings 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.890
 a touch of flavor and then the proteins 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.810
 of my breakfast because I have not obtained anything 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.270
 of the egg whites and I've put 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.460
 five clear good four and a half what 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.110
 you see that there are four and a half 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.600
 and it has left me a splash of 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.630
 stevia and ground cinnamon and then there has been 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.250
 everything before spending a lot and the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.050
 pan as always with a splash of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.990
 oil well spread so that we are not 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.020
 stick and nothing what I have left is 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.640
 this is how good the tortilla has 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.710
 stayed a little bit darker I do not know 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.840
 you can see out there because when you take the 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 cinnamon because it gives the appearance of more 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 little yellow baby as if he had a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.470
 bud but they are not only clear and the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.080
 chocolate that is over this the world 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.390
 the fans that nothing I have put a 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.740
 spoon sopera so that I stay 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.010
 cream style 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.990
 and the fruit of my breakfast today once 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.200
 more drink I have here a slushie of 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.630
 watermelon and banana that I have done with 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.640
 crushed ice and was doing all the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.250
 fruit with this crushed ice and nothing very 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.290
 simple I have not been sweetener 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.940
 because I had to give him ice to 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.650
 that I can not stand the fruit and 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.540
 then it has been quite sweet to me 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.670
 I did not need it, I like it that way 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.260
 but good that if you want that again 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.970

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.960
 organized of fruit because what I 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.850

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.820
 quite nutritious very complete that 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.390

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.750

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.579
 of high quality that will bring us 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.690

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.090
