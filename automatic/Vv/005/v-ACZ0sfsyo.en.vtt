yeah hi I'm Olaf tegel and this is one

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.680 
yeah hi I'm Olaf tegel and this is one
of<00:00:36.329> my<00:00:36.540> 3d<00:00:36.960> printed<00:00:37.410> guitars<00:00:38.180> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> project

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of my 3d printed guitars it's a project

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
of my 3d printed guitars it's a project
i<00:00:39.780> started<00:00:39.809> i'm<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.559> passionate<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:41.160> 3d

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
i started i'm very passionate about 3d

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
i started i'm very passionate about 3d
printing<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.149> what<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:42.989> industry

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
printing and what it can do for industry

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
printing and what it can do for industry
in<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.010> sorts<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.340> different<00:00:44.399> areas<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
in all sorts of different areas and as

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.840 
in all sorts of different areas and as
an<00:00:46.079> experimental<00:00:46.590> project<00:00:46.950> i<00:00:47.280> decided<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
an experimental project i decided you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
an experimental project i decided you
know<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.510> print<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.230> working<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
know can you actually print a working to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.619 
know can you actually print a working to
me<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.550> 3d<00:00:51.030> guitar<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
me to get up 3d guitar with the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.380 
me to get up 3d guitar with the
technology<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> turned<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.360> well

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
technology and it turned out so well

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
technology and it turned out so well
that<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.899> decided<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.559> something

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that we decided there was something

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.139 
that we decided there was something
we're<00:00:55.980> starting<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.520> business<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.120> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
we're starting a little business out of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
we're starting a little business out of
printing<00:00:57.899> essentially<00:00:58.800> custom<00:00:59.190> made<00:00:59.399> guitars

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
printing essentially custom made guitars

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.150 
printing essentially custom made guitars
will<00:01:00.059> make<00:01:00.329> each<00:01:00.539> guitar<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> customer

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
will make each guitar to the customer

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
will make each guitar to the customer
specification<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.120> whatever<00:01:03.359> they<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.840> in

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
specification with whatever they want in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.359 
specification with whatever they want in
there<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.729> 3d<00:01:06.150> printing<00:01:06.479> works<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
there so the way 3d printing works is

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.260 
there so the way 3d printing works is
conventional<00:01:08.369> manufacturing<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.000> start

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
conventional manufacturing you start

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.149 
conventional manufacturing you start
with<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> block<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.900> material<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.530> cut<00:01:10.890> away

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
with a block of material you cut away

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
with a block of material you cut away
everything<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.540> there's<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
everything you don't want so there's a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
everything you don't want so there's a
lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> wastage<00:01:13.380> 3d<00:01:14.220> printing<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.909> start

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
lot of wastage 3d printing you start

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
lot of wastage 3d printing you start
with<00:01:15.360> nothing<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.380> build<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> part

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
with nothing and you build up the part

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
with nothing and you build up the part
slice<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.270> sliced<00:01:18.600> by<00:01:18.840> sliced<00:01:19.170> by<00:01:19.380> slice<00:01:19.619> until

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
slice by sliced by sliced by slice until

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
slice by sliced by sliced by slice until
the<00:01:20.009> whole<00:01:20.159> party<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> started<00:01:21.930> off

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
the whole party and well I started off

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.600 
the whole party and well I started off
with<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> spider<00:01:22.650> guitar<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.369> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with a spider guitar and it was really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420 
with a spider guitar and it was really
designed<00:01:23.850> largely<00:01:24.630> because<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
designed largely because it was the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.980 
designed largely because it was the
biggest<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.540> machine<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
biggest we could do in the machine we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
biggest we could do in the machine we
have<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.500> New<00:01:28.590> Zealand<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:30.060> always

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
have here in New Zealand and I always

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760 
have here in New Zealand and I always
sort<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> decided<00:01:31.020> I'd<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> slightly

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
sort of decided I'd go for a slightly

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.460 
sort of decided I'd go for a slightly
heavy<00:01:32.100> metal<00:01:32.460> type<00:01:32.700> themed<00:01:33.180> guitar<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
heavy metal type themed guitar and I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.539 
heavy metal type themed guitar and I
thought<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> spiders<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.340> quite

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
thought the spiders was quite

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.190 
thought the spiders was quite
appropriate<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> spider<00:01:36.900> webbing

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
appropriate so we had a spider webbing

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.260 
appropriate so we had a spider webbing
with<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.159> spiders<00:01:38.430> inside<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
with a lot of little spiders inside and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.660 
with a lot of little spiders inside and
again<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:40.049> printed<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.920> piece<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.460> comes

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
again all printed in one piece it comes

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.740 
again all printed in one piece it comes
out<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> machine

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
out of the machine

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
out of the machine
go<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> final<00:01:44.850> prototypes<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
go so the final prototypes have got a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.720 
go so the final prototypes have got a
wooden<00:01:46.350> pore<00:01:46.710> through<00:01:46.980> the<00:01:47.100> middle<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.400> it<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
wooden pore through the middle of it and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.190 
wooden pore through the middle of it and
that<00:01:48.240> means<00:01:48.480> again<00:01:48.660> it's<00:01:48.810> part<00:01:49.050> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that means again it's part of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.500 
that means again it's part of the
customization<00:01:49.980> by<00:01:50.130> using<00:01:50.340> maple<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:51.120> mahogany

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
customization by using maple or mahogany

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.719 
customization by using maple or mahogany
or<00:01:51.780> whatever<00:01:52.620> would<00:01:52.830> we<00:01:52.979> want<00:01:53.190> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> inside

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
or whatever would we want on the inside

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.610 
or whatever would we want on the inside
we<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.150> customize<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:55.080> tone<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
we can now customize the tone of the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.400 
we can now customize the tone of the
guitar<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.190> well<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.120> looks<00:01:57.410> I'm

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
guitar as well as the way it looks I'm

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.080 
guitar as well as the way it looks I'm
at<00:01:58.620> Massey<00:01:58.979> University<00:01:59.550> in<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.790> school<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
at Massey University in the school of

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.460 
at Massey University in the school of
engineering<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:00.720> advanced<00:02:00.930> technology

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
engineering and advanced technology

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.070 
engineering and advanced technology
we're<00:02:01.650> doing<00:02:01.979> both<00:02:02.520> research<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
we're doing both research on the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.930 
we're doing both research on the
technologies<00:02:04.710> are<00:02:04.890> developing<00:02:05.280> new<00:02:05.490> 3d

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
technologies are developing new 3d

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.880 
technologies are developing new 3d
printing<00:02:06.240> technologies<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.260> things<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.619> for

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
printing technologies so things like for

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.499 
printing technologies so things like for
example<00:02:07.920> were<00:02:08.280> developing<00:02:08.759> machine<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.240> print

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
example were developing machine to print

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.420 
example were developing machine to print
in<00:02:09.690> rubber<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.649> print<00:02:10.770> rubber<00:02:11.070> parts

of<00:02:11.520> soft<00:02:11.760> rubber<00:02:12.209> parts<00:02:12.600> also<00:02:13.410> we're<00:02:13.530> doing<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of soft rubber parts also we're doing a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800 
of soft rubber parts also we're doing a
lot<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> research<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.520> applications<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.570> how

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
lot of research on applications so how

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.100 
lot of research on applications so how
can<00:02:16.709> we<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.310> technology<00:02:17.989> for<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
can we use this technology for the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.050 
can we use this technology for the
benefit<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.500> New<00:02:19.650> Zealand<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.160> Jesus<00:02:20.459> changes

business models you can imagine that a

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.530 
business models you can imagine that a
company<00:02:23.489> instead<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> having<00:02:24.060> hundreds<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
company instead of having hundreds of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.690 
company instead of having hundreds of
spare<00:02:24.870> parts<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> shelf<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.610> these

machines<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.300> print<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> parts<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.230> they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
machines and print the parts as they

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.170 
machines and print the parts as they
need<00:02:28.770> them<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.520> it's<00:02:29.640> really<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.880> game<00:02:30.150> changer

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
need them so it's really a game changer

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
need them so it's really a game changer
in<00:02:30.720> terms<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.680> how<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.190> business

you draw it up on the computer you can

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.970 
you draw it up on the computer you can
make<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.170> I've<00:02:46.290> got<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.590> example

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
make it so I've got a little example

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.590 
make it so I've got a little example
here<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.459> a<00:02:47.489> bit<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.760> strange<00:02:48.060> example

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
here it's a bit of a strange example

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.060 
here it's a bit of a strange example
this<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.780> little<00:02:49.080> radial<00:02:49.440> engine<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:49.980> a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this is little radial engine it's just a

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.770 
this is little radial engine it's just a
prototype<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.239> see<00:02:51.360> when<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.570> turn<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
prototype but you see when you turn the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.570 
prototype but you see when you turn the
handle<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.470> back<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> Pistons<00:02:53.370> move

handle on the back all the Pistons move

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.090 
handle on the back all the Pistons move
now<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.540> whole<00:02:54.810> thing<00:02:55.140> is<00:02:55.320> printed<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.890> one

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
now this whole thing is printed in one

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.220 
now this whole thing is printed in one
piece<00:02:56.340> comes<00:02:57.060> off<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.239> machine<00:02:57.630> assembled
