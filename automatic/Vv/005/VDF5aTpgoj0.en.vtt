Johnson<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.609> far<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:20.910> these<00:00:21.060> three<00:00:21.240> practices

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
Johnson so far on these three practices

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.120

it<00:00:21.930> looks<00:00:22.080> completely<00:00:22.560> different<00:00:22.830> than<00:00:23.070> he

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it looks completely different than he

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.730 
it looks completely different than he
did<00:00:23.160> all<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> last<00:00:24.390> year<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.050> mean<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> entire

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
did all of last year I mean the entire

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.390 
did all of last year I mean the entire
last<00:00:26.130> year<00:00:26.369> including<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.920> spring<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
last year including the spring in the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.310 
last year including the spring in the
summer<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.910> hopefully<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.050> keep<00:00:31.170> him

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
summer so hopefully we can keep him

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
summer so hopefully we can keep him
going<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:31.859> direction<00:00:32.120> because

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
going in the right direction because

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790 
going in the right direction because
that<00:00:33.360> would<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.540> huge<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:33.809> us<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.590> again

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that we don't lose guys I think we do a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.180 
that we don't lose guys I think we do a
pretty<00:03:54.630> good<00:03:54.840> job<00:03:54.990> on<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.890> terms<00:03:55.920> of

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
pretty good job on that in terms of

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.660 
pretty good job on that in terms of
practicing<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.710> a<00:03:58.740> good<00:03:58.980> pad<00:03:59.220> level<00:03:59.400> but

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
not on the guys on the ground so it was

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.700
