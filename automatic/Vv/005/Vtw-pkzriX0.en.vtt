00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
so I'm taking cold porcelain and I'm

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.769 
so I'm taking cold porcelain and I'm
going<00:00:17.740> to<00:00:17.800> make<00:00:17.920> an<00:00:18.010> oval<00:00:18.430> slice<00:00:18.790> that<00:00:19.119> make<00:00:19.750> a

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
going to make an oval slice that make a

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.200 
going to make an oval slice that make a
circle<00:00:20.260> and<00:00:20.410> switch<00:00:20.680> that<00:00:20.860> on<00:00:20.920> top<00:00:21.220> going<00:00:22.060> to

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
circle and switch that on top going to

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.760 
circle and switch that on top going to
merge<00:00:22.390> them<00:00:22.660> together<00:00:22.840> by<00:00:23.230> rubbing<00:00:23.590> them

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
merge them together by rubbing them

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.370 
merge them together by rubbing them
until<00:00:24.640> it<00:00:24.760> become<00:00:25.029> one<00:00:25.210> piece<00:00:25.480> then<00:00:26.290> I'm

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
until it become one piece then I'm

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.530 
until it become one piece then I'm
taking<00:00:26.410> another<00:00:26.980> piece<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:27.580> I'm<00:00:27.880> going<00:00:28.180> to

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
taking another piece and I'm going to

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.290 
taking another piece and I'm going to
make<00:00:29.170> it<00:00:29.320> long<00:00:29.560> and<00:00:29.890> round<00:00:30.340> the<00:00:30.460> edges<00:00:30.610> this<00:00:31.210> is

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
make it long and round the edges this is

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.450 
make it long and round the edges this is
going<00:00:31.449> to<00:00:31.510> be<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.750> two<00:00:31.930> arms<00:00:32.320> I'm<00:00:33.040> also<00:00:33.250> going

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
going to be the two arms I'm also going

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.189 
going to be the two arms I'm also going
to<00:00:33.550> merge<00:00:33.670> those<00:00:33.940> two<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.629> you<00:00:34.690> can<00:00:34.989> add<00:00:35.170> a

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
to merge those two so you can add a

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.840 
to merge those two so you can add a
little<00:00:35.530> bit<00:00:35.650> of<00:00:35.710> water<00:00:35.890> to<00:00:36.070> help<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.699> with

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
that then creating two more ovals I'm

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.700 
that then creating two more ovals I'm
going<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.970> apply<00:00:40.239> those<00:00:40.540> on<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.199> bottom<00:00:41.500> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
going to apply those on the bottom and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.830 
going to apply those on the bottom and
these<00:00:42.010> are<00:00:42.129> going<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.309> be<00:00:42.400> the<00:00:42.519> legs<00:00:42.760> I'm<00:00:43.600> just

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
these are going to be the legs I'm just

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.799 
these are going to be the legs I'm just
