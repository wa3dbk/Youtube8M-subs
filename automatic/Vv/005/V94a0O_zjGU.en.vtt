 to mine is that he expects them to be very good 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.900
 Well, this time I'm here to make another video or tutorial on nails 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.220
 I know I had not put any video in last week but 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.009
 I do not know if I told them I was going to be a godmother and everything is in three weeks 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.579
 the president down the truth can not be boiled from the tutorial 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.039
 rather the nail art tutorial I wanted to 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.429
 seems mentioned 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.119
 but you can call me later in the 20s and member in this between olés I'm going to 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.379
 show some pictures of the signs he was wearing 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.920
 but this is totally different and this is the design by which we go to day of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.130
 today 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.360
 for this we are using puellés 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.860
 the chinese design 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.840
 uu 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.460
 a good such I do not know the truth if it is Chinese no but 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 It is oriental to not miss and for that I will use my plate m 66 dec with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610
 nothing 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 and I'm going to use the ekin monita 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.390
 then I will use ana the lotus flower 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.910
 i will use the flowers of the blue chevy plan 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.360
 what is this tree known for that I am also going to use min 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.260
 white school special enamel 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.740
 ni enamel special school in rosita cakes 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.520
 the conar special 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680
 that is called sadik fifth 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.330
 what is common pink 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.700
 flourishing 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.370
 and with white we start 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 to put it in the middle 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.940
 very subtle alba hoist 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.950
 all the images of the same plate 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 i hope you like it 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.420
 can apply to the little girl can try to impose it in the middle 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.830
 includes stamping 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.309
 and then apparently if I stay in the middle 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.539
 now body 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.479
 to clean my plate 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.549
 to continue with the next image 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.370
 What is it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.750
 with the little pink I'm going to apply it on the lotus flower that is the image that 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.439
 is the center 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.439
 and I'm going to take the lotus flower the smallest 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.529
 I'm going to 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.619
 place it 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:52.309
 crossed does not matter what I know that is facing the design on top of the other of the 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.179
 Monita does not matter 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.659
 anyway they will reach to see the detail separately 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.539
 Anelka, I do it much later 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.439
 interesting in some way 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.109
 I'm going to clean a print 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.799
 again buoy stamp postra lotus flower 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.849
 you can put them in context with nothing 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.849
 accommodate light as you like here 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.229
 and for this I'm going to take the biggest 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.389
 in the others he had not taken it but 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.629
 apparently 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.629
 It came out in the picture 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.309
 now 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:48.079
 since I have the two holy images of lotus flower 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:49.630
 I'll put 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.089
 the little flowers of the chevy plaza 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.169
 and for that I'm going to use the fluorescent pink color 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.329
 and you can take the flowers you want from here on the plate if you notice it is like a 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.609
 tree 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.139
 the chevy emplazan 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.389
 It is very beautiful they are minimal 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.389
 aam very small flowers 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 I'm going to put those 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.349
 here next 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.150
 now I'm going internally to my plate 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.810
 and I'm going to choose other flower quotes you can choose the biggest ones and that's 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.659
 you have room 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.960
 togo amd 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960
 do not worry 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.170
 I will choose other 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.259
 two 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.310
 and I think it's the same size as those that have 3 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.150
 scraped return 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.819
 I will place them 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.819
 up here 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.479
 these are going to go horizontal 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.870
 And finally you can choose another 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.870
 customers a big 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.289
 a great advantage that you have in study 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.289
 like I have a little space there 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.339
 and there is a big little flower 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:29.339
 I will scrape 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.569
 imposed 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.830
 I'm going to place the big one 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830
 here in the pure lineage 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.150
 and there is the design of plans that you already have the design of all the nails 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.029
 I'm going to finish with my cool work and for that I'm going to use the conaf 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:01.699
 of old age 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:04.699
 finished 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.560
 I liked it, I loved this design, it's very, very nice 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.250
 adam if you do not want to put it on so much that's optional, you know how to decorate 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:22.069
 your nails 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.330
 but 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.069
 good friend Maria Costa 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.080
 put a lot of little details to me yes 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.939
 and because this design was made to me my father wanted to share it with you 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.840
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.210
 at the end I will answer the photographs 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.199
 I hope 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.330
