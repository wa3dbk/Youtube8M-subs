00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.019
 chords using the nomadic hordes function 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.080
 when we press one key we get 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.039

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.400

 a match should not this 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:41.270
 up sharp there is something elevated 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.299
 she already did not give but also niche and miracles 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.899
 and the most interesting and the same 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.259

 if we go backwards and flat 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.130
 besides 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.580
 will it be varna from or be more 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.380
 that is how my room will be 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.940
 it will be called keys 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.520
 depend on the key in which you 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.390
 but you are not strong yet 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.220
 load 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.010
 you just need to know where it is 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.460
 this other salt where is the fish riding 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.010
 now how to be with chords in nomadic 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.900
 hordes really nothing changes everything 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.780
 just as easy when we clicked 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.320
 one more we sounded major that is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.740
 same sharp or to sharp major 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.930
 remember if we needed exactly us 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.930
 pushed two keys at us it turned out 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.170
 I do the same thing and here we press 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.750
 2 keys get cd with that c sharp 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.050
 minor and again no matter which two 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.530
 press a key on such 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.840
 ki are the main thing that it was two 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:30.420
 keys and the bottom one was then drive 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 painfully Daria Set chord C sharp 7 to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.540
 Sharp minor septa chord cd cm7 all like this 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.590
 thats just if you have a flat eg 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.070
 flat here you have 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.580
 now you need to come down here on 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:55.590
 half tone below e past 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.010
 in E flat major in E flat minor going 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.470
 alto m 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.150
 barely pray 7 that is if you have 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.400
 there are such icons do not need them 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.379
 scared you just need to know what 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.409
 side you move if you have now 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.440
 you already for sharp major mean you 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.580
 move to the floor tone up that is to say 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.860
 neighboring black key 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.419
 everything is all very simple if you play you 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.020
 yourself 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:35.110
 fingers built them themselves without help 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.289
 function jamb hard 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:43.910
 it's still very simple for you to just 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.860
 you need to move each of the keys to 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.830
 half a tone higher or lower see for example 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.560
 You had an AM code. 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.560
 lamina remember how we built it for 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:02.900
 studied 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.800
 from 1 to 2 notes three keys from 2 to 3 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.790
 notes in chord 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.730
 4 keys 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.160
 you had a minor card for example 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:16.080
 need a court for flat minor 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.800
 which means you should now build q 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.220
 that's what you say well and all the same 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.220
 here you are 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:37.760
 4 it turns out this is the code we have my mother's 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:42.040
 note these keys we moved 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:45.440
 one key not every wear shifted 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.800
 air lower if you need sharp 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.860
 accordingly you go upwards that is 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:58.580
 for example, sharp major 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:06:01.700
 how we were built can be distributed for 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:06.670
 Men if you can not mean to 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.670
 arrange work from this key rostov 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.940
 C sharp 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.610
 all here and so just with these icons 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.640
 badger sores or raspberries don't need them 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.640
 to be afraid
