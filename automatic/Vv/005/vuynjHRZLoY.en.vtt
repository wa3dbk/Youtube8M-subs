00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 what do you think dairy products 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.849
 for us the most important calcium cate 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.590
 Calcium Calcium Calcium Calcium each 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.590
 calcium course 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.590
 science regarding dairy 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.060
 industry and bone health 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.369
 pretty consistent 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 as well as the national union fighting 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.840
 osteoporosis use it in their 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 recommendations 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 osteoporosis destructive bone disease 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.000
 which is mainly related to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 calcium deficiency 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.079
 if this is true state with high 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.420
 consumption of dairy products which 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.340
 are the main source of calcium in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.969
 Western food should have a low 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 osteoporosis incidence but 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.329
 according to a study done 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 outstanding hormone skim scientists 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 high consumption state 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.390
 calcium tend to be high 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.469
 hip fracture rate which is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.370
 key indicator of osteoporosis in 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.710
 really high consumption 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 dairy products leads to high 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.600
 the level of osteoporosis is just the opposite. 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 what does the dairy industry tell us 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.010
 one of the main mechanisms of this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.570
 animal protein prone to education 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.280
 acid in the state which is called 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.840
 metabolic acidosis to cope 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.909
 with this body condition 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.810
 retrieves the most accessible item for 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.360
 calcium acid buffering from bones 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.070
 as calcium is extracted for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.869
 neutralizing acid bones weaken 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.579
 protecting the beneficial properties of milk a lot 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 public health 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.799
 organizations now recommend 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.799
 consume low-fat dairy products 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.049
 it could be milk yogurt cheese all that 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.880
 made from milk but the main thing is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.790
 recommendation from the american dietary 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.820
 associations of the national union to combat 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.030
 osteoporosis cancer cardiovascular 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.100
 diseases it should contain as much as possible 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.009
 less fat fat remove protein becomes 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 more in proportion the products become 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.429
 richer protein all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.110
 poorer in fat and if we compare these 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.420
 high protein non-fatty foods 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.880
 for example with cancer incidence 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.980
 prostate bond is so strong 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.980
 between smoking and lung cancer
