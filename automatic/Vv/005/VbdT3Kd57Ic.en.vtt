or let me count there should be nine
count<00:02:05.289> them<00:02:05.530> nine<00:02:05.770> drop<00:02:06.190> pods<00:02:06.720> there's<00:02:07.720> three

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
count them nine drop pods there's three

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.180 
count them nine drop pods there's three
four<00:02:10.319> there's<00:02:11.319> five<00:02:13.709> instruction<00:02:14.709> forms

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
four there's five instruction forms

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.530 
four there's five instruction forms
let's<00:02:15.340> see<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:15.640> there's<00:02:16.260> nine<00:02:17.260> pods<00:02:17.709> or<00:02:18.250> not

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.530 

there's<00:02:23.299> I<00:02:24.299> love<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.170> okay<00:02:25.409> hold<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> let's<00:02:25.980> see

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
there's I love it okay hold on let's see

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
there's I love it okay hold on let's see
so<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.780> guess<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.170> only<00:02:28.290> way<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.500> figure<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.859> out

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
so I guess the only way to figure it out

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:39.039 
so I guess the only way to figure it out
is<00:02:29.189> if<00:02:29.430> there<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.819> nine<00:02:30.060> bases<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.599> 1<00:02:30.870> 2<00:02:31.590> 3<00:02:32.870> 4<00:02:36.500> 5<00:02:37.500> 6

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
is if there is nine bases as 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:52.970 
is if there is nine bases as 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:02:41.269> 9<00:02:44.030> 09<00:02:45.030> drop<00:02:45.840> pod<00:02:46.079> ah<00:02:46.439> ah<00:02:46.920> ah<00:02:50.120> wow<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:52.739> much
