been at it for a while isn't there a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.780 
been at it for a while isn't there a
better<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.860> figure<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.280> what's<00:01:38.430> inside

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
better way to figure out what's inside

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.240 
better way to figure out what's inside
it's<00:01:39.360> common<00:01:39.720> sense<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.080> do<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.799> or

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it's common sense to do it this way or

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.530 
it's common sense to do it this way or
else<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.610> been<00:01:41.820> lots<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> lots<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.420> money

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
else it's been lots and lots of money

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.420 
else it's been lots and lots of money
and<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.899> forget<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> want<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> call

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just for figures you can also use that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
just for figures you can also use that
method<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.890> find<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> cards<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.820> to

if<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.890> open<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> case<00:02:14.580> hiding<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
if they just open the case hiding the

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.240 
if they just open the case hiding the
patterns<00:02:15.720> easy<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.260> okay<00:02:16.709> that's<00:02:16.890> pretty

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
patterns easy and okay that's pretty

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.650 
patterns easy and okay that's pretty
awesome<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.819> there's<00:02:18.000> no<00:02:18.150> way<00:02:18.299> I'm<00:02:18.450> telling

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
her that if anyone can figure it out

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330 
her that if anyone can figure it out
don't<00:02:21.840> derail<00:02:22.110> things<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.650> snap<00:02:22.920> them<00:02:23.130> right

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
don't derail things can snap them right

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
someplace where there's an expert or two

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.539 
someplace where there's an expert or two
the<00:02:28.049> rare<00:02:28.230> cards<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.709> secret<00:02:29.040> figures<00:02:29.400> are

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
the rare cards and secret figures are

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.640 
the rare cards and secret figures are
usually<00:02:29.880> gone<00:02:30.060> before<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
usually gone before you know it when I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.360 
usually gone before you know it when I
go<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> store<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.519> see<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> bunch<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.120> cases

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.440 

down<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:38.730> think<00:02:38.940> there's<00:02:39.150> still<00:02:39.390> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
down there and think there's still a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.390 
down there and think there's still a
chance<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.350> few<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.799> sounds<00:02:41.370> like

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
chance there's a few like sounds like

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.759 
chance there's a few like sounds like
you<00:02:41.609> could<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.120> therapy<00:02:42.660> anyway<00:02:43.620> I

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
you could use some therapy anyway I

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.590 
you could use some therapy anyway I
heard<00:02:44.190> somewhere<00:02:44.579> that<00:02:44.640> collectors<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
heard somewhere that collectors can just

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.479 
heard somewhere that collectors can just
buy<00:02:45.750> everything<00:02:45.930> buy<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> case<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.220> true

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
buy everything buy the case is that true

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.090 
buy everything buy the case is that true
ah<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.540> true<00:02:48.810> collector<00:02:49.410> if<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:49.950> buy

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
ah that's a true collector if you buy

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
ah that's a true collector if you buy
stuff<00:02:50.340> buy<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.579> case<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.180> complete<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
stuff buy the case you can complete the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.150 
stuff buy the case you can complete the
set<00:02:51.870> quicker<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.620> figure<00:02:52.799> out<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
set quicker and you can figure out the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.610 
set quicker and you can figure out the
patterns<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.670> distribution<00:02:53.959> really<00:02:54.959> yes<00:02:55.320> it's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
patterns of distribution really yes it's

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.080 
patterns of distribution really yes it's
