00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.830 
let's go ahead and check out our combat
record<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.920> see<00:03:05.920> how<00:03:06.160> we're<00:03:06.430> doing<00:03:06.840> KD

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
record and that see how we're doing KD

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.559 
record and that see how we're doing KD
ratio<00:03:08.140> I<00:03:08.410> think<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.890> went<00:03:08.980> down<00:03:09.250> 2.0<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.150> haven't

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
ratio I think it went down 2.0 I haven't

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.850 
ratio I think it went down 2.0 I haven't
really<00:03:10.660> been<00:03:10.840> doing<00:03:10.900> too<00:03:11.230> good<00:03:11.349> in<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.590> game

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
really been doing too good in this game

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.949 
really been doing too good in this game
unfortunately<00:03:12.640> win-loss<00:03:13.030> ratio<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.720> pretty

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
unfortunately win-loss ratio it's pretty

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.050 
unfortunately win-loss ratio it's pretty
bad<00:03:14.140> itself<00:03:14.620> too<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.430> at<00:03:15.519> least<00:03:15.610> it's<00:03:15.819> above

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
bad itself too but at least it's above

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.660 
bad itself too but at least it's above
one<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.630> am<00:03:16.930> i<00:03:17.049> score<00:03:17.290> per<00:03:17.410> minute<00:03:17.620> that's<00:03:17.799> 377

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
one so am i score per minute that's 377

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.780 
one so am i score per minute that's 377
could<00:03:19.450> be<00:03:19.600> better<00:03:19.959> but<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.340> said<00:03:21.400> I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
could be better but like I said I

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.520 
could be better but like I said I
haven't<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.389> been<00:03:22.569> performing<00:03:23.049> too<00:03:23.319> well

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530
