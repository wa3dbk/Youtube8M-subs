00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
overclocking you just want something

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.600 
overclocking you just want something
cool<00:04:12.560> and<00:04:12.680> quiet<00:04:12.920> that's<00:04:13.220> what<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.490> is

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
cool and quiet that's what this is

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.280 
cool and quiet that's what this is
really<00:04:13.790> engineered<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:14.510> if<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.110> want

KaBlam through two fans one mounts here
one<00:04:44.690> mounts<00:04:44.990> here<00:04:45.340> you<00:04:46.340> can<00:04:46.490> either<00:04:46.550> mount

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
one mounts here you can either mount

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.170 
one mounts here you can either mount
this<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.360> top<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.500> back<00:04:48.650> of<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:48.919> case

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
this to the top to the back of your case

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.790 
this to the top to the back of your case
actually<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.360> even<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.840> bottom<00:04:51.200> of<00:04:51.470> your<00:04:51.560> case

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
actually to even the bottom of your case

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.880 
actually to even the bottom of your case
because<00:04:52.550> it's<00:04:52.820> so<00:04:52.970> small<00:04:53.030> very<00:04:53.930> very<00:04:54.530> flexible

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
because it's so small very very flexible

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.490 
because it's so small very very flexible
so<00:04:55.430> anyways<00:04:55.730> hey<00:04:55.940> guys<00:04:56.120> it's<00:04:56.540> me<00:04:56.810> Elric<00:04:57.320> I'm
