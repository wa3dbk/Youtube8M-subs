hello everybody - born Napster and this
dragged<00:00:32.550> tune<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.270> doing<00:00:33.600> today<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
dragged tune that we are doing today is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.470 
dragged tune that we are doing today is
the<00:00:35.190> SRT<00:00:35.820> Viper<00:00:35.850> DTS<00:00:36.630> launch<00:00:36.989> edition<00:00:37.620> 2013<00:00:38.480> I

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the SRT Viper DTS launch edition 2013 I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.340 
the SRT Viper DTS launch edition 2013 I
find<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.010> one<00:00:41.370> does<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> best<00:00:42.450> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
find that this one does me the best this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
find that this one does me the best this
tomb<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.190> work<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> other<00:00:45.350> Vipers

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
tomb will work on all the other Vipers

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.970 
tomb will work on all the other Vipers
so<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.039> works<00:00:47.550> better<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.329> faster<00:00:48.980> that

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so if one works better or is faster that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.369 
so if one works better or is faster that
I<00:00:50.010> do<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.460> yet<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:51.480> tune<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:52.020> work<00:00:52.199> on

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I do not yet know this tune will work on

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
I do not yet know this tune will work on
it<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.190> sure<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.399> all<00:00:53.489> have

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it because I'm pretty sure they all have

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.080 
it because I'm pretty sure they all have
the<00:00:53.760> same<00:00:53.789> horsepower<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.690> weight<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the same horsepower and weight so and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.700 
the same horsepower and weight so and
yes<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.750> weights<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.440> different

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
yes the weights a little bit different

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.020 
yes the weights a little bit different
force<00:00:58.920> powers<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> little<00:00:59.820> bit

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
force powers a little a little bit

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
force powers a little a little bit
different<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.870> should<00:01:01.199> be<00:01:01.350> fine<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> mean<00:01:01.890> don't

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like off by like point zero zero one or

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.940 
like off by like point zero zero one or
point<00:01:05.519> zero<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> transmission<00:01:07.680> don't

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
point zero two in the transmission don't

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.429 
point zero two in the transmission don't
worry<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.549> you're<00:01:08.640> fine<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.780> copy<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
worry about it you're fine just copy the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
worry about it you're fine just copy the
tune<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.610> close<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.850> possible

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
