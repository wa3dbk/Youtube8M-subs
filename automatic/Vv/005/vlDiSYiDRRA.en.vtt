 Pep guardiola he sets today on one 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.860
 sophisticated and varied 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.330
 intense but that has no other 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 expected yes I think that is with 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.600
 normal weeks actually times so that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.180
 then still a bit more intense 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 trains with 1 when we play three games 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.269
 the week I think that will become 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 so prevail with big man freer 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.309

 and think about tony yeah it's ours 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.420
 goal and in the end optimally 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 to prepare well before the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.270
