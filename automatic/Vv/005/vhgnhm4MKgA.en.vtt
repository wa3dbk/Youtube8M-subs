00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.099
 in your everyday life it's a little 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 to serve salem know that I risk 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.730
 to do some damage anyway so I 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.859
 can I can have played it honestly 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.149

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.100
 not know where we are not knowing what we 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.860
 did it's something that could 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.330
 happen what is it that I have 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 plant life of a high level athlete 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.720
 and that is and I was very strict in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 everything I did but I have them 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.260
 precious I needed to be serious 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.970
 no seriously I note that you speak to 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.589

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.369
 finished would then there so it stinks late and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.080
 in that hour you play in victor 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 young perez movie poster 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 that's not too violent the big gap 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.680
 with me from you fuggers arriving cows 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.600
 after playing a role also it was 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 not so in the sense ie I 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 adapt to the costumes days it became 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.560
 red the pro you see you're gone go from 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.290
 loans that just have there is another 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.360
 boxer kind of like that gone towards 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.649
 a career as a comedian art cinema all 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.119
 that's mike tyson is here now he 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.070
 it's just a little new 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 that you consider rhythm in stand up I 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.710
 do not think I'm able to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 after in the plane we do not know but in 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 anyway it's not think to be good 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.979
 in this area right after I come from 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.729
 to go to the movies sincerely 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 awesome doing episodes like that 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.000
 me that's what I like in reality so 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.959
 it may even make you want to go to 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.729
 the theater at the limit finally the 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.240
 boards because ultimately it's not 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.459
 so far 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.289
 yeah you ask play before their 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.940
 purposes before that I have to work 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.979
 what I need to learn a little 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.810
 profession is in any case losses 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.500
 why not shut down 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 perspective 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.759
 we'll see yes that you're still having fun 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.459
 frankly me it was a joke 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 what years then especially there for for 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.410
 the show is great to take on 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.790
 play and mess it up feels good too 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.260
 it was a little bit apprehensive 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.599
 still buses that it's people 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
 who choose the scenario you followed 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.620
 a little bit last night the tweets that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240
 was falling to see what talent sauce 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.140
 and to eat or have I looked at a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.520
 small but that's what is the saint 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.099
 boss that's exciting because you 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.750
 really do not know what to expect 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.910
 so I made some movies at 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.540
 final it was not very far from what 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.980
 I imagined 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.409
 but holding 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.550
 you did not see it actually I saw on the 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.500
 twitts at some point there are some who 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.900
 ask me to come to barbie dhabi 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.239
 been good go there the little skirt she 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.129
 would have been better last episode had 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.120
 hoisted Moudenc was there and then it 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.099
 precisely he has a little idea of 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.599
 scenario I quickly showed brahim 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.040
 I gave advice to 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.650
 writers is that you get broken 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.840
 the mouth by an elderly woman has arrived 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.819
 like that she hits you and she 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 fucked up after there is a child 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.030
 who comes and who finishes you I think that's me 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.519
 seems pretty seen 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.459
 since you're more or less a swatter 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.629
 it's not beating it makes you want to 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.950
 find in an episode with him 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.620
 maybe to check other authors 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 yeah I hope because the next episode 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.560
 when the moon girls will be grane 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.150
 propose to come had to break the mouth 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.680
 okay it can be nice to me 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.599
 followed with me the small places it's 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.370

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.379
