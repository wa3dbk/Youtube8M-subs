it's<00:01:41.299> very<00:01:41.509> very<00:01:41.689> important<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.829> do<00:01:43.100> so

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's very very important that we do so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.590 
it's very very important that we do so
in<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.430> very<00:01:43.549> professional<00:01:43.939> way<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.299> am

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
in a very professional way I am

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.399 
in a very professional way I am
concerned<00:01:45.109> when<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.649> see<00:01:46.179> people<00:01:47.179> who<00:01:47.299> are

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
concerned when I see people who are

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.139 
concerned when I see people who are
opportunistically<00:01:48.670> exacerbating<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.939> very

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
opportunistically exacerbating the very

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.450 
opportunistically exacerbating the very
worst<00:01:50.420> elements<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.229> church<00:01:51.469> itself<00:01:51.859> you

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
worst elements of the church itself you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.940 
worst elements of the church itself you
know<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:52.609> remember<00:01:53.179> when<00:01:53.450> Tyler<00:01:53.899> Perry<00:01:54.229> had<00:01:54.920> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
know I remember when Tyler Perry had a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.760 
know I remember when Tyler Perry had a
development<00:01:55.460> deal<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:55.789> ABC<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.049> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
development deal with ABC and the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.649 
development deal with ABC and the
standards<00:01:58.249> folks<00:01:58.460> there<00:01:58.700> see<00:01:58.939> it<00:01:58.999> you<00:01:59.509> know<00:01:59.630> I

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659

our real issue I think many many people
who<00:02:31.070> fall<00:02:31.370> prey<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:32.350> negative<00:02:33.350> messages<00:02:33.890> that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
who fall prey to negative messages that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.580 
who fall prey to negative messages that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.320 
are perpetuated through the media do so
because<00:02:36.980> they<00:02:37.190> don't<00:02:37.220> have<00:02:37.550> control<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.030> their
