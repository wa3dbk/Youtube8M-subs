00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.750
 Gabriel who called me to the rescue 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.039
 for a coaching session 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.079

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.160
 thank you keane is delighted so say 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.660
 me all the girls basically we have a 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.460
 little poem is that our parents are 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.540
 not only there and we do not know who 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.860
 gave then what is this 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.210
 that you like of course no pizza is 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.030
 easy huh what do you like a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.370
 a little less perhaps, especially since we know 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 not really how the three heads this 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 make small vegetable pizzas by 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.550
 example downright hate you dad 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.899
 we're going to brew of acquisition look 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.609
 in the fridge what you have and ben 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.050
 great tomato you package it will 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.019
 we serve ready made pizza dough 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.160
 battle but also simon battle vegetables 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:59.570
 necessarily because it's a little bit 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.329
 challenge of the day you sure it's true 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.929
 than hockey tomatoes too I like 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.970
 well in monza 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.050
 yeah yeah we're going to prepare them okay 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.940
 to be nice so we have tomatoes 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.250
 fresh eggplant zucchini carrots 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.179
 for the side a little big when the dough to 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.710
 ready made pizza 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:14.119
 we will save time on the merits 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.289
 will have a little mozart full of guys from 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.490
 provence and where you go to see you go 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.560
 give taste and flavors 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.899
 so we will start by preparing in 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.920
 vegetables we will carve some to put it 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.179
 in the teeth the vegetables so that's 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.130
 nice to the museum that you like them 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.660
 paws but not the salad vegetables and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.520
 already here it is pretty funny even 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.110
 at home can do this for 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.420
 little salads and all that can be 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.289
 very nice and tags of carrot 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.500
 you do a little bit back to the 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.940
 stove 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.649
 it's a lot of vegetables we will do them 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.409
 come back first like that they will render 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.740
 all their juice 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.890
 like that gildas galette we want this guy 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.179
 of this thickness of 15 mm gold for 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.189
 the moment I'm going to preheat 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.719
 the oven at 220 degrees rather because we 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.890
 going to do we're going to actually evict them to 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.420
 remove all the seeds inside 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.530
 we're not going to do tackles was to 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.340
 tomatoes we're just going to cut them in small 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.539
 dice at how we will tackle 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.429
 the eggplant we will cut in four 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.959
 so what we want to do is we go 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.939
 to make them return to the pan the vegetable 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.530
 with a small background of olive oil and 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.259
 then the herbs of Provence we go 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.360
 even season the wells are there 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.560
 cooking on the fire I mean we're going 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.690
 sweat them for three minutes 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.739
 and then we will add water we will 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.569
 cook them for 5 minutes 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.829
 What I like is what taste 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.360
 that a little bit fit anyway a 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.739
 little bit pro corner so you see them 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.590
 eight so that's gone I live but it 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.060
 start loved we'll add a little 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.060
 little water to make an effect of fear 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.950
 so the room remained me these clauses 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.370
 gradually add so you 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.510
 put the equivalent of 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.489
 2 tablespoons each time 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.379
 I was waiting for the lapthorne vegetables and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.299
 then we start by going from 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.069
 eggplant where are not what 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.140
 will make the state Sunday transparency in 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.299
 do we know it's good it's not good 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.860
 I will have managed to disgust you 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.269
 victims on the ground and we can start to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.879
 to install the door wow it's huge 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.930
 it's done then the flour is just 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.519
 to glue it too is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.010
 why do you work if you use 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.750
 a round paw from your home 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.909
 try with your rolling pin 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.340
 to give him the most because form is 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.799
 possible that we can do is go a 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.720
 little worry we will use a little bit 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.190
 tomato coulis we will not put 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.450
 a lot you have to be super careful 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.970
 with pizzas allow us to 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.079
 last tubes otherwise it will cook in 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.720
 place for me to be told I never 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.909
 notice so here is the base really 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.190
 light a little bit of that match like that 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.440
 it's not bad 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.209
 sabathia perfect automatisms and puts 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.640
 directly downwards whereas thou 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.170
 take with your hand you would say part 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.150
 won is to evenly distribute so j 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.829
 invites to keep on oneself on the quarter 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.160
 of time we will make small cubes of 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.010
 fast mode one is the same 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 from that if you want idle then y'a 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.010
 one side actually where we will put a little 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.540
 less things for example to you 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.050
 keep a band of three 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.390
 centimeters 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.860
 we'll roll your tan like that that right 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.250
 wants to do well but then the little 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.780
 label it's gone we're not going that way 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.190
 nothing good air we know very well 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.360
 in the all in the same sense as 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:06.880
 that's not bad with the effects that 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.930
 choice I'm not sure what good ok is 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.210
 what we're going to do is we're going to roll 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.770
 so we start from there you start from an edge 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.240
 which one you have the most loaded 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.800
 hyper important that's true your 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.840
 roll because then during the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.700
 cooking if you do not squeeze the roll 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.600
 Well, it's not going well, it's going to spread 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.670
 not stay together well 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.160
 ok and we roll like this here we are 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.650
 has the basic role that we are going to count 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.230
 well and you transvaal and you let 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.690
 well 3 cm you give them its round shape 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.790
 dakar had believed finger like that who are you 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.020
 the robot you feel free to do the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.700
 next time you do it all 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.190
 alone like moors to the letter of a 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.630
 strict in as 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.740
 so eh not bad no I love bacon 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.660
 mushrooms cut into strips 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.180
 you are doing a forest version 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.730
 mushroom to run if it's pretty 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.100
 visually martinic when betting on eating 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.200
 good and it will be perfect when so the 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 cooking is fast enough but it is cooked to 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.460
 hot oven we go for about 15 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.140
 minutes but at 220 ° it does not remain 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.700
 than to discover our severe earthy asses 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.180
 so goes 15 min cooking is fine 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.280
 suffice 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.500
 they are well gilded it's going well aware 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.940
 this is where they send each other 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.980
 vegetables of the sun that's what I 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.810
