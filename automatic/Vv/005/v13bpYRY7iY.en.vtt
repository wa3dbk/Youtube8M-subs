obviously up and down again being the
three<00:00:41.360> axis<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.660> pretty<00:00:43.200> cool<00:00:43.379> i<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.860> even

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
three axis is pretty cool i can even

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.490 
three axis is pretty cool i can even
turn<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.420> does<00:00:45.600> stay<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.410> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
turn this and it does stay now if you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
turn this and it does stay now if you
turn<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> slowly<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> follow<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
turn it slowly it's going to follow to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.069 
turn it slowly it's going to follow to
where<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:50.160> it'll<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> nice<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:50.940> slow<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
where but it'll do it nice and slow so

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.650 
where but it'll do it nice and slow so
even<00:00:52.440> though<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:52.829> still<00:00:52.949> doing<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
even though you're still doing this it's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.389 
even though you're still doing this it's
still<00:00:54.750> moving<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> things<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.190> paid

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

here<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> doesn't<00:01:09.869> fit<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.439> until

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
here or it doesn't fit in there until

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.660 
here or it doesn't fit in there until
you<00:01:10.830> pull<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:14.010> goes<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.549> why

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you pull it out that goes in that's why

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
you pull it out that goes in that's why
it<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.240> spring-loaded<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:16.950> take<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
it it's spring-loaded so you take that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.420 
it it's spring-loaded so you take that
and<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> are<00:01:17.850> able<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.659> slide<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.619> up

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and you are able to slide this right up

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.719 
and you are able to slide this right up
the<00:01:20.580> handle<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.049> tighten<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.729> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the handle and then just tighten it be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.260 
the handle and then just tighten it be
more<00:01:23.909> careful<00:01:24.150> than<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
more careful than I was and now you have

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.600 
more careful than I was and now you have
the<00:01:27.720> ability<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> GoPros

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
the ability to look at using the GoPros

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.289 
the ability to look at using the GoPros
Wi-Fi<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.710> app<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.610> able<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> watch

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
Wi-Fi you know app I'm able to watch

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.130 
Wi-Fi you know app I'm able to watch
what<00:01:36.750> I'm<00:01:36.900> shooting<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.960> pretty

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what I'm shooting so now I have a pretty

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.749 
what I'm shooting so now I have a pretty
good<00:01:40.290> view<00:01:40.590> at<00:01:40.770> least<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.280> sure<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> I'm

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
good view at least to make sure that I'm

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.899 
good view at least to make sure that I'm
in<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> right<00:01:42.600> range<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.530> where<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.490> going

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
in the right range of where I'm going

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.100 
in the right range of where I'm going
but<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:46.490> that<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:48.090> does<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
but you can see that it does have and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
but you can see that it does have and
then<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> move<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> make<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> little

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
then I can move this and make a little

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
then I can move this and make a little
bit<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.820> comfortable<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.360> well<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:52.500> are

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
bit more comfortable as well there are

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.660 
bit more comfortable as well there are
different<00:01:52.680> modes<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.189> haven't<00:01:53.430> figured<00:01:53.520> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
different modes I haven't figured out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.740 
different modes I haven't figured out
what<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> different<00:01:54.180> modes<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> but

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
what the different modes to you but

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.630 
what the different modes to you but

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:14.789 
plants and if I wanted to get that shot
where<00:03:07.299> I'm<00:03:07.510> able<00:03:07.719> to<00:03:07.930> go<00:03:08.609> really<00:03:09.609> high<00:03:09.790> up<00:03:13.799> come

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
where I'm able to go really high up come

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.090 
where I'm able to go really high up come
all<00:03:14.949> the<00:03:15.099> way<00:03:15.129> down

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.190 

it's<00:03:19.610> adjusting<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.300> little<00:03:20.720> bit<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.140> that

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
it's adjusting a little bit on that

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.410 
it's adjusting a little bit on that
third<00:03:22.190> axis<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:23.680> don't<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.770> if<00:03:24.890> that's<00:03:25.070> just

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
third axis I don't know if that's just

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.730 
third axis I don't know if that's just
where<00:03:26.420> my<00:03:26.720> hand<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.200> tilting<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:29.680> after<00:03:30.680> it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
where my hand is tilting it after it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.520 
where my hand is tilting it after it
gets<00:03:30.830> up<00:03:31.040> higher<00:03:31.280> does<00:03:31.670> seem<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.120> it's<00:03:32.530> it's

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
gets up higher does seem like it's it's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.690 
gets up higher does seem like it's it's
changing<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:36.170> a<00:03:36.200> different<00:03:36.700> different

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
changing to a different different

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.890 
changing to a different different
position<00:03:38.980> but<00:03:39.980> otherwise<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:41.600> looks<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.870> be

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
position but otherwise it looks to be

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.380 
position but otherwise it looks to be
pretty<00:03:41.990> smooth<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.680> GoPros<00:03:43.670> about<00:03:43.880> dead<00:03:44.090> so

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
pretty smooth I GoPros about dead so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.610 
pretty smooth I GoPros about dead so
this<00:03:44.750> will<00:03:44.900> probably<00:03:45.080> be<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.290> end<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
this will probably be the end of the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.710 
this will probably be the end of the
video
