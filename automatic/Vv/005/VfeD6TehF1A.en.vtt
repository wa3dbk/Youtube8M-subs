 great movement promotes self-esteem 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.660
 to prevent anorexia and bulimia 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.910
 lie wants to be a campaign that 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.219
 since 2007 teaches us to 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.530
 girls to love us for who we are and 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.420
 not for we met and this year it brings us 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.910
 the opportunity to create our insight 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.590
 karts that are super cute messages that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.970
 ourselves we can do to 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.770
 share with our friends with 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.170
 our friends and thus also promote 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.430
 self - esteem that I bring this look 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.739
 today it is very simple 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.090
 natural because the idea is to highlight those 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.030
 nice things that we have 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.739
 naturally and that are simply the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 reflection of how beautiful we are 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.309
 inside I'm going to start this look 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.460
 applying these powder powders the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.290
 Undercover powders that are powders 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 translucent what does it mean that he 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.469

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.899

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.520
 brush and I will apply it in all my 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.980
 face with this shape what I'm going to do 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.649
 is to remove the shine of the face 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.970
 all that fat we do not like 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.130
