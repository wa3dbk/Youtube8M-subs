00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.730 
hey but it's got crushed my friends but
bot<00:01:47.300> kills<00:01:47.570> aren't<00:01:47.960> really<00:01:48.170> impressive<00:01:48.650> I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
bot kills aren't really impressive I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.490 
bot kills aren't really impressive I
think<00:01:49.040> there's<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.990> human<00:01:50.990> around<00:01:51.080> here

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
think there's a human around here

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.320 
think there's a human around here
somewhere<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.340> no<00:01:52.700> idea<00:01:53.060> where<00:01:53.240> he's

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
somewhere that's it no idea where he's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.690 
somewhere that's it no idea where he's
gone<00:01:53.540> or<00:01:53.780> who's<00:01:53.930> been<00:01:54.140> killed<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.740> don't<00:01:55.430> even

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
gone or who's been killed I don't even

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
gone or who's been killed I don't even
know<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:55.970> I'm<00:01:56.090> gonna<00:01:56.180> look<00:01:56.270> out<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:56.510> their

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
know you I'm gonna look out for their

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.540 
know you I'm gonna look out for their
enemies<00:01:56.830> since<00:01:57.830> we're<00:01:57.950> playing<00:01:58.010> attrition

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
enemies since we're playing attrition

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.219 
enemies since we're playing attrition
it's<00:01:58.940> worth<00:01:59.210> going<00:01:59.450> for<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.750> box<00:01:59.930> because

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
it's worth going for the box because

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.870 
it's worth going for the box because
they<00:02:00.350> do<00:02:00.410> count<00:02:00.800> towards<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> scored<00:02:01.729> your

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
they do count towards the scored your

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
they do count towards the scored your
team<00:02:03.400> but<00:02:04.400> at<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> point<00:02:05.300> in<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.510> box<00:02:05.720> is

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
team but at the point in the box is

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.130 
team but at the point in the box is
essentially<00:02:06.320> just<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.619> add<00:02:06.770> action<00:02:07.780> they<00:02:08.780> they

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
essentially just to add action they they

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.780 
essentially just to add action they they
basically<00:02:09.320> adds<00:02:09.740> what's<00:02:10.070> going<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
basically adds what's going on on the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.600 
basically adds what's going on on the
map<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.930> try<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.410> focus<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
map but I try and focus on the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.210 
map but I try and focus on the
