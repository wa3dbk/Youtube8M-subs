00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.700
 in one of the videos I posted the drawings on 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.790
 adjusting the point of the knives as well 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.590
 already showed it in finished form 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:19.949
 and showed it by action adaptation 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 This is a device made for 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.010
 very good person for the same we in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.230
 principle drawings but with small 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.200
 change this change first 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.360
 queue completely 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.239
 fixtures made of stainless steel 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.940
 that is, the action of stainless steel except 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 worried for the bars they are made of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.469
 aluminum as if what was left there by 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 materials on the design of all dimensional 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.960
 dimensions 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 preserved as in the previous drawings in 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.059
 that's what changed it changed only 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.309
 the thickness of the bed stand structure 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.560
 there is it already made of bar 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.070
 that is simplified here and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.329
 magnet attachment principle and principle 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.430
 attaching this stand that is in 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.640
 Glorious option, that is, everyone opens up 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.960
 no screw connections magnet 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.299
 glued in the past past in that 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.329
 the drawings indicate that there is a screw 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.740
 connection then cops and now that's all 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:40.130
 this magnet would be simpler glued on 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.049
 epoxy glue which it costs 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:50.209
 around two dollars a national bank 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:55.580
 and what else has changed is this appearance 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:57.770
 that is, the very appearance of this bed is 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.399
 adaptation that is from all sides 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:10.160
 century even in general even a clamping plate 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:23.450
 and so it is done in the same 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:26.299
 design like a little image 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.609
 made it easy to make it 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:35.390
 adaptation well, you can still it 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:41.660
 simplify I'll show you will do one thing 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:46.910
 device for a friend without a magnet 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:51.700
 and much easier in general here 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.639
 I also want to note that by magnet I still 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.560
 suffered again with these hard drives and 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:03.849
 chop magnet hard drive rather here 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.080
 Now you can have all the easier to find 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:11.170
 online store has already found different forms 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.830
 magnets different efforts there are square and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.959
 rectangular and round diametrically from 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.560
 holes that is and reinforcements can and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.410
 glue reinforcements in general big 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.410
 assortment of neodymium magnets do not need 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.600
 mock at hard drives that is 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.090
 I recommend I advise you to use 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.580
 magnet and which if internet sales 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 Stores price they have inexpensive there 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:47.680
 something in the area is also about two three 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:55.840
 dollars for a magnet is available such 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:01.690
 adaptation glamorous and all 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.030
 thank you subscribe 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.450
 I'll post the next video with a new one soon. 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.450
 gadget luck
