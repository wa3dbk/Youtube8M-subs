00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
for long periods of time I don't think

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.380 
for long periods of time I don't think
it'll<00:00:30.019> change<00:00:30.429> the<00:00:31.429> other<00:00:31.490> they<00:00:31.730> wanted<00:00:32.119> once

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
sort of new drainage system in between

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.820 
sort of new drainage system in between
the<00:01:05.220> campsite<00:01:05.700> entrance<00:01:06.120> and<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> main

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the campsite entrance and the the main

the campsite entrance and the the main
bridge<00:01:08.330> which<00:01:09.330> always<00:01:10.140> oh<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.370> some

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
bridge which always oh that is for some

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.750 
bridge which always oh that is for some
reason<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.270> gets<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:12.810> wet<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.760> we've

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
reason that just gets very wet and we've

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
reason that just gets very wet and we've
already<00:01:14.940> started<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.540> work<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
already started that work you know to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.360 
already started that work you know to
put<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:18.500> sort<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> underground<00:01:19.979> drainage

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
put a sort of underground drainage

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.600 
put a sort of underground drainage
system<00:01:20.910> in<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.450> hope<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:23.490> know

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
system in which we hope will you know

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.960 
system in which we hope will you know
provider<00:01:23.910> run<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.300> into<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.660> lake<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
provider run off into the lake that in a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
provider run off into the lake that in a
circle<00:01:27.300> way<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.620> mean<00:01:29.370> that<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
circle way and that will mean that it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.640 
circle way and that will mean that it
won't<00:01:29.910> get<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> wet

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.830 

no<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.670> car<00:01:37.850> parks<00:01:38.120> and<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.300> exits<00:01:38.660> look<00:01:38.780> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
no the car parks and the exits look a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.280 
no the car parks and the exits look a
lot<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.050> difficult<00:01:39.650> actually<00:01:41.290> yeah

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
lot more difficult actually yeah

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.260 
lot more difficult actually yeah
probably<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.710> bit<00:01:42.860> more<00:01:43.010> gravel<00:01:43.400> needed<00:01:43.730> around

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
probably a bit more gravel needed around

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.910 
probably a bit more gravel needed around
some<00:01:44.630> of<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> car<00:01:44.930> park<00:01:45.170> prerequisites<00:01:45.650> but

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
some of the car park prerequisites but

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.180 
some of the car park prerequisites but
they<00:01:46.100> certainly<00:01:46.550> more<00:01:46.790> difficult<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.860> eat<00:01:48.860> you

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
they certainly more difficult to eat you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.220 
they certainly more difficult to eat you
know<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.520> set<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.150> plan<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.630> predict<00:01:50.990> because

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
know to set a plan and predict because

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.720 
know to set a plan and predict because
ultimately<00:01:52.070> experiment<00:01:54.070> they're<00:01:55.070> not<00:01:55.190> cuter

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
ultimately experiment they're not cuter

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:07.639 
ultimately experiment they're not cuter
making<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.660> series<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.050> rogues

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.980 

no<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.610> improvements<00:02:10.119> did<00:02:10.270> not<00:02:10.509> come<00:02:10.869> at

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
no and the improvements did not come at

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.930 
no and the improvements did not come at
a<00:02:11.020> cost<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.440> was<00:02:11.590> taken<00:02:11.890> out<00:02:12.010> of<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
a cost that was taken out of the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.940 
a cost that was taken out of the
budget<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:15.250> certainly<00:02:15.490> kept<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.850> cost<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.770> did

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
budget they certainly kept a cost it did

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.970 
budget they certainly kept a cost it did
cost<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.310> lot<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.580> money<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.620> eat<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.770> know<00:02:20.800> to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
cost a lot of money to eat you know to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.680 
cost a lot of money to eat you know to
make<00:02:21.130> those<00:02:21.340> changes<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.060> said<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:22.420> wasn't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
make those changes but it said it wasn't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.610 
make those changes but it said it wasn't
at<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.840> expense<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:25.750> budget

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.440 

yes<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> i<00:02:32.310> didn't<00:02:32.520> think<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.730> Sam<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
yes there is i didn't think that Sam I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.370 
yes there is i didn't think that Sam I
didn't<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:33.930> an<00:02:34.050> issue<00:02:34.170> with

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
didn't think there was an issue with

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.500 
didn't think there was an issue with
female<00:02:34.890> toilets<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.460> it<00:02:35.610> female<00:02:35.910> toilets<00:02:36.180> or

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
female toilets was it female toilets or

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.340 
female toilets was it female toilets or
female<00:02:36.810> urinal<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:38.840> don't<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:39.930> there<00:02:40.170> was<00:02:40.230> an

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
female urinal I don't think there was an

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.200 
female urinal I don't think there was an
issue<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:40.740> Mallik<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.160> Mindless<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.790> didn't

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
issue at Mallik to Mindless I didn't
