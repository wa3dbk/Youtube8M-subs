00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hi to all the boys here and giuseppe 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 rooms welcome to this new logo 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.629
 Today we return to talk about assassin's 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.340
 creed ii united but not just indeed 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 we'll also talk a little about assassin's 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.730
 creed comment everything that happened 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.889
 precisely in the last two weeks 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 It concerns the world of the assassin's creed 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.800
 first I wanted to remind you that in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.390
 description find the links of mine 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.039
 facebook page on which the invitation to 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 let us also humble ourselves to pass 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 also with the mouse on the same I like and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.350
 click on receive notification in this 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.269
 so you will be sure not to lose them 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 no place concerning my own 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.109
 channel also I remind you that I will be 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 present at the comicon of naples 1 2 3 and 4 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.500
 May therefore all four days 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 from the fair of which the first two days 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 or 1 and 2 May I will be present at 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 personal gamer stand 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.250
 I don't know yet how to improve the precise 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 so for this reason it is important 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 that you seem to me on facebook because there 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.370
 In fact, I will tell you all the times 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 where I may find myself a certain one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.489
 moment then boy do you recommend them 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.469
 follow me there also the first news 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.059
 important about writing them together 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.039
 seems to be the introduction of a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 new feature in the game indeed we are 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.100
 speaking of the horizontal race on 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.260
 walls a feature we have already seen 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.750
 in titles such as I think Persia 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 developed just from ubisoft but that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 apparently from tower to in this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 chapter 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.150
 obviously there are no confirmations to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.430
 regard but we still have some 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 information because jazz is the fair 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.299
 or an athlete who also makes gods 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.040
 video about parkour seems to be 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.049
 portrait in a photo with the equipment 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 from motion capture and in the description 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 of the photo itself written that stands 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 then working for a video game 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 boy could that be the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.850
 our assistance I believe unity in 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.680
 last weeks it was running on the net a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 very particular concept art 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.250
 about the protagonist indeed of a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.259
 hypothetical protagonist of assassin's 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.390
 creed comet as you can see is this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.540
 here obviously boy was it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 a fake since the artist himself has 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.810
 statement that has quotation marks is 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.320
 copied some features of the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.350
 dressed in a concept art of rais sono 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 grom just a title released for xbox 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.110
 one boy then it was a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.000
 fake we hope to have soon 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.560
 official information about the game 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.299
 nevertheless we still have some 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 really particular information indeed 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.719
 I wanted to bring back some news that I have 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 found on the net regarding ha 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.060
 written unity and comet impacts could 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.069
 there have been some advances in the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.289
 years past even with a trailer 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.210
 by assassin's creed iii regarding the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.710
 multiplayer 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.170
 in fact in this trailer they come 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.450
 shown two busts of two characters 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.220
 historians in fact the first was Napoleon 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
 which we will certainly see in assassin's 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.810
 creed unit i and ii and giulio cesare who 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.370
 maybe we could see in 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 assassin's creed comet that between 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.370
 quotes goes to confirm that a bit 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.720
 which I said weeks ago about the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.910
 historical period of assassin's creed 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.620
 comet that was said to be precisely all 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.300
 ancient roma obviously these guys 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.160
 they are not confirmations but of 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.630
 interesting clues finally we arrive 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.640
 to the most important news about it 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.890
 assist registered members or have the fact 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.690
 that the game will have two campaigns and one 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.040
 as for the single player e 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.350
 the second regarding the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.910
 multiplayer that will be playable in the body 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.770
 therefore up to four players will be 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 really fine guys play with i 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.980
 own friends in four players 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.110
 four assassins to carry out missions 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.610
 of this new campaign I make you 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.500
 note that the single player is 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.300
 that of multiplayer will be two campaigns 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.070
 so distinct i 'm really curious about 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.960
 see how that will evolve 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.700
 of the multiplayer boy with the videos yes 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.320
