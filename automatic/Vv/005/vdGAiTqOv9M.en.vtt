hello and welcome to Sasuke tutorials in
this<00:00:07.069> tutorial<00:00:07.220> we<00:00:08.029> are<00:00:08.090> going<00:00:08.180> to<00:00:08.389> make<00:00:08.570> this

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
this tutorial we are going to make this

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.760 
this tutorial we are going to make this
wheel<00:00:09.350> into<00:00:09.920> two<00:00:10.280> II<00:00:10.309> AutoCAD<00:00:11.350> so<00:00:12.350> let's<00:00:12.559> begin

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
wheel into two II AutoCAD so let's begin

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.000 
wheel into two II AutoCAD so let's begin
this<00:00:13.039> with<00:00:13.789> circle<00:00:14.469> I'll<00:00:15.469> start<00:00:15.830> with<00:00:15.949> a

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
this with circle I'll start with a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.360 
this with circle I'll start with a
central<00:00:16.309> circle<00:00:16.609> of<00:00:17.539> radius<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.920> that<00:00:19.130> meter

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
central circle of radius of that meter

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.890 
central circle of radius of that meter
1.12<00:00:20.920> okay<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.880> let's<00:00:23.120> make<00:00:23.300> a<00:00:23.330> circle<00:00:23.720> of<00:00:23.810> the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
1.12 okay so let's make a circle of the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.230 
1.12 okay so let's make a circle of the
Iowa<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.740> now<00:00:24.950> go<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.130> circle<00:00:25.460> again<00:00:25.700> with<00:00:26.150> the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
Iowa to now go to circle again with the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.060 
Iowa to now go to circle again with the
same<00:00:26.480> Center<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:28.610> using<00:00:29.420> diameter<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:33.140> three

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
same Center and using diameter of three

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.040 
same Center and using diameter of three
make<00:00:34.489> another<00:00:34.789> circle<00:00:35.679> the<00:00:36.679> same<00:00:36.890> Center<00:00:37.339> and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
make another circle the same Center and

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.700 
make another circle the same Center and
again<00:00:39.050> a<00:00:39.499> circle<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.809> diameter<00:00:42.079> of<00:00:42.530> four

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
again a circle with a diameter of four

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.360 
again a circle with a diameter of four
point<00:00:42.949> eight<00:00:43.069> seven<00:00:43.309> units<00:00:44.829> so<00:00:45.829> we<00:00:45.949> have<00:00:46.129> all

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
point eight seven units so we have all

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.059 
point eight seven units so we have all
the<00:00:46.519> circles<00:00:46.879> concentric<00:00:47.620> at<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.889> same

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
the circles concentric at the same

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.250 
the circles concentric at the same
Center<00:00:50.559> okay<00:00:51.559> that's<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:52.609> good<00:00:52.789> a<00:00:52.819> circle<00:00:53.149> again

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
Center okay that's a good a circle again

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.539 
Center okay that's a good a circle again
and<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.440> time<00:00:54.499> I'll<00:00:54.799> make<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.069> circle<00:00:55.519> with

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
and this time I'll make a circle with

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:59.410 
and this time I'll make a circle with
radius<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:56.179> six<00:00:56.749> point<00:00:57.079> five<00:00:57.409> units<00:00:58.120> now<00:00:59.120> go<00:00:59.359> to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
radius of six point five units now go to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.379 
radius of six point five units now go to
circle<00:00:59.929> again<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.499> make<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.129> with<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.089> radius

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:02.389 
circle again and make it with the radius

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.670 
circle again and make it with the radius
of<00:01:02.510> seven

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
of seven

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.660 
of seven
let's<00:01:05.250> move<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.670> construction<00:01:06.090> lines<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
let's move on to construction lines and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.740 
let's move on to construction lines and
help<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.910> construction<00:01:09.360> line<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.660> an

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
help make the construction line at an

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.160 
help make the construction line at an
angle<00:01:09.870> of<00:01:11.750> 55<00:01:12.750> degrees

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
angle of 55 degrees

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.700 
angle of 55 degrees
so<00:01:13.940> press<00:01:14.940> angle<00:01:15.510> sign<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.640> at<00:01:17.640> 55<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> at

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
so press angle sign here at 55 and at

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.710 
so press angle sign here at 55 and at
doing<00:01:20.010> so<00:01:20.730> here<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> construction

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
doing so here we have a construction

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.040 
doing so here we have a construction
line<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.110> angle<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> 55<00:01:22.800> degrees<00:01:23.190> and<00:01:24.050> exit

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
line at an angle of 55 degrees and exit

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.210 
line at an angle of 55 degrees and exit
it<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:26.340> mayor<00:01:26.730> this<00:01:26.970> construction<00:01:27.480> line

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
it now mayor this construction line

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.200 
it now mayor this construction line
using<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.540> vertical<00:01:30.540> y-axis<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.060> this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
using the vertical y-axis so here this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
using the vertical y-axis so here this
so<00:01:33.870> here<00:01:34.080> we<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.380> construction<00:01:34.980> lines<00:01:36.890> now

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
so here we have construction lines now

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.330 
so here we have construction lines now
trim<00:01:38.750> chip<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> extra<00:01:40.440> portion<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> we

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
trim chip all the extra portion that we

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
trim chip all the extra portion that we
don't<00:01:41.580> require<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:42.900> would<00:01:43.410> be<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.740> two

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
don't require it would be these two

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.900 
don't require it would be these two
parts<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> case<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.560> these<00:01:47.490> two<00:01:47.640> parts

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
parts in this case and these two parts

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.930 
parts in this case and these two parts
also<00:01:48.920> appear<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.100> let's<00:01:50.310> delete<00:01:50.670> these<00:01:50.880> two

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
also appear now let's delete these two

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.840 
also appear now let's delete these two
lines<00:01:51.300> we<00:01:51.510> don't<00:01:51.720> need<00:01:51.840> them<00:01:52.080> anymore

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.350 

okay<00:01:59.420> now<00:01:59.540> go<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.840> select<00:02:00.880> select<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:01.970> radius

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
okay now go to select select the radius

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820 
okay now go to select select the radius
and<00:02:03.850> select<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:04.970> radius

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.390 

of<00:02:08.010> one<00:02:08.640> unique<00:02:08.940> path<00:02:10.010> me<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.070> favorite

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of one unique path me the favorite

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.280 
of one unique path me the favorite
limits

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.850 

let's<00:02:16.290> join<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.100> using<00:02:17.400> J<00:02:17.970> enter<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:19.800> we

let's join this using J enter and now we

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.660 
let's join this using J enter and now we
have<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> joint<00:02:20.990> this<00:02:21.990> segment<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.890> let's<00:02:23.100> move

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
have a joint this segment and let's move

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.390 
have a joint this segment and let's move
it<00:02:23.850> using<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.210> center<00:02:24.510> point<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.080> point

these selections here go to trim again
and<00:02:35.370> trim<00:02:35.610> all<00:02:35.820> these<00:02:36.060> lines<00:02:36.270> which<00:02:36.450> are<00:02:36.570> not

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
and trim all these lines which are not

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720 
and trim all these lines which are not
required<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.410> trim<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.070> trim<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> the

required so trim it and trim of the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.620 
required so trim it and trim of the
cells<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.790> don't<00:02:42.150> need<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.480> either

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
cells and now we don't need this either

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.360 
cells and now we don't need this either
trim<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> awesome

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370

now let's go to explore and explore

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.050 
now let's go to explore and explore
these<00:02:48.739> lines<00:02:49.120> using<00:02:50.120> X<00:02:50.450> enter<00:02:51.580> okay<00:02:52.580> now<00:02:53.000> we

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
these lines using X enter okay now we

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.150 
these lines using X enter okay now we
have<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.510> exploded<00:02:54.020> lines<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.800> let's<00:02:55.010> go<00:02:55.099> to

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
have the exploded lines now let's go to

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.059 
have the exploded lines now let's go to
fill<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.819> make<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.780> fill<00:02:57.080> up<00:02:57.260> with<00:02:57.560> radius

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
fill it and make a fill up with radius

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.780 
fill it and make a fill up with radius
of<00:02:58.220> 0.3<00:02:58.760> units<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.830> here<00:03:00.830> apply<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.280> fields

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
of 0.3 units and here apply these fields

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.759 
of 0.3 units and here apply these fields
here<00:03:01.940> select<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.810> again<00:03:03.110> with<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.620> same

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
here select it again with the same

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.509 
here select it again with the same
radius<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.459> apply<00:03:04.760> Flitz<00:03:05.000> here<00:03:05.300> too<00:03:05.620> okay<00:03:06.620> now

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
radius and apply Flitz here too okay now

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.490 
radius and apply Flitz here too okay now
I'll<00:03:07.849> go<00:03:08.060> ahead<00:03:08.120> select<00:03:08.660> all<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:09.050> them<00:03:09.290> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
I'll go ahead select all of them and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.390 
I'll go ahead select all of them and
join<00:03:10.069> J<00:03:11.030> enter<00:03:11.630> joining<00:03:12.260> them<00:03:12.410> now<00:03:13.069> let's<00:03:13.190> make

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
join J enter joining them now let's make

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.280 
join J enter joining them now let's make
an<00:03:13.550> array<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.000> these<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.480> as<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:14.959> can<00:03:15.110> see

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
an array of these and as you can see

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.960 
an array of these and as you can see
that<00:03:15.470> we<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.709> six<00:03:16.040> objects<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.880> I'll

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
that we have six objects here so I'll

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.690 
that we have six objects here so I'll
use<00:03:17.300> polar<00:03:17.660> array<00:03:17.980> select<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.100> object<00:03:19.280> and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
use polar array select this object and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.780 
use polar array select this object and
select<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.600> center<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:22.370> we<00:03:22.519> have<00:03:22.670> the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
select the center and here we have the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.559 
select the center and here we have the
default<00:03:22.910> array<00:03:23.390> using<00:03:23.600> six<00:03:24.110> objects<00:03:24.530> here

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
default array using six objects here

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.449 
default array using six objects here
close<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.750> sorry<00:03:28.090> okay<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.299> think<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:31.430> have

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
close the sorry okay I think we have

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.449 
close the sorry okay I think we have
obtained<00:03:32.239> our<00:03:32.330> drawing<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.470> then<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.250> just

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
obtained our drawing and then we just

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.180 
obtained our drawing and then we just
need<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:35.000> make<00:03:35.150> these<00:03:35.360> bolts<00:03:35.780> here<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.709> let's

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
need to make these bolts here so let's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.460 
need to make these bolts here so let's
make<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:37.720> before<00:03:38.720> making<00:03:38.959> them<00:03:39.110> we<00:03:39.260> need<00:03:39.380> to

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
make them before making them we need to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.020 
make them before making them we need to
make<00:03:39.650> some<00:03:39.890> construction<00:03:40.370> lines<00:03:40.549> here<00:03:40.790> so

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
make some construction lines here so

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.970 
make some construction lines here so
let's<00:03:41.930> go<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.170> construction<00:03:42.470> line<00:03:42.680> again

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
let's go to construction line again

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.100 
let's go to construction line again
select<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.910> center<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.569> make<00:03:45.080> a
