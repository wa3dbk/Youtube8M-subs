00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.110
 talk about a brand that has been very successful 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.849
 when I posted on my instagram 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.019
 you are already in sevilla clothes like that 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.550
 raquel that is the lola and it seems that it is well 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.840
 difficult to find to buy or have 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.260
 more in Rio de Janeiro if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.599
 I received from their advisors 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.240
 four products here from the creole line 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.740
 I tested a lot in different ways then 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.609
 I came to talk here for you guys. 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.490
 start with this one is the cream of 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.170
 comb perfect curls super wires 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.630
 hydrated links management but lack 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.680
 final touch is the final touch would be the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.960
 crime 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.560
 I think you have it big right now 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.270
 150 ml for those who have curly hair 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.010
 In fact, for those with curly hair, 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.680
 difficult for those with frizzy hair 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 a tube of if we know right 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.150
 Is it that I found the cream, let's go first. 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.380
 show texture here for you he has 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.230
 a firm texture 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.110
 is a firm texture but at the same time 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.330
 it's light-fleshed it's not a texture 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.640
 Firm ointment knows you see it goes 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.540
 I weigh in the hair but it even gives a 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.310
 neighbor is good and let me see a climate 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.200
 They offer excellent results in 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.330
 definition of the perfect curls for the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.840
 call of all kinds does not have the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.540
 curls defined by 24 hours 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.180
 is required for all caching to use 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.500
 after the shampoo and conditioner to apply 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.240
 a small amount in the hair 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.960
 wet never forward root to tips 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.430

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.700
 small amount small quantity 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.530
 with this product here did not happen goin to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.290
 I tested it with less not rolled 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.540
 the bunch lasts 24 hours the bunch lasts 24 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.310
 hours but so I can not get a day 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.770

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.590

 so I can not even get through it 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.110
 this is my criticism of this product is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.760
 I put a few more things 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.610
 Bring me another kind of cream. 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.130

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.290

 domestic box imperatives all 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
 boxes are imperative, it's not perfect 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.520
 for touch - ups in the middle of the morning and you will 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.490
 The night guarantees success at that party. 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.900
 of box two and when any 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.670
 hour during the day 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.560
 the polisario from the root to the tips 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.990
 definition that begins to hover over your 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.920
 hair 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.560
 he is very good he does not leave his hair 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.700
 I always have dry hair 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 following day 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.450
 only very few of 150 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.130
 ml for who has a lot of hair my 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.410
 Luck is that my hair looks much more 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.170
 nothing is to be done 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.610
 This one worked great, I liked it. 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.880
 he does not leave any hair hard 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.920
 Look, I got this so I recommend it. 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 only used dry hair because the people 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.660
 in wet hair humidifier in hair 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.370
 never has an effect for those who have 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:28.690
 dog is good recommended this other 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.630
 this one is the famous pichador is an oil 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.400
 coconut to stimulate the scalp 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.260
 olive oil to moisturize honey to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.540
 soften and soothe and coconut water to 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.890
 shine 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.600
 so use sparingly in the hair 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.220
 wet or dry apply a few drops 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.070
 in wet hair before modeling 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.080
 with brush or flat iron after modeling 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.140
 two or three drops of 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.080
 control I did not use a little chap 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.850
 or brush because she does flat iron brush 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.620
 It's necessary to learn how to make iron. 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.670
 a great chap and I can not use 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.870
 I do not know 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.550
 and it's really good, I just do not know how to pre 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.130
 in this case, I used it as I do 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.740
 would use a normal oil only the texture 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.370
 People are like a gel. 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.580
 You can see a very light day. 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.160
 Okay, I'll choose that and apply it on my hair. 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.590
 only that in the wet wires before 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.459
 pass the cream using it together with 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.069
 cream 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.770
 gives better insured 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:30.009
 curls but even so it is not 100% 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.780
 the product is good it gives brightness only that it 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.300
 also does not take effect and it does not 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.370
 is made to be used alone in the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.849
 brush case and if someone uses 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.789
 Where do you tell me this process I used only 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:46.180
 I like curly hair and this one 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.250
 which was a great surprise that it is a 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.539
 Charming foam perfect curls is 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.060
 an anguish right? 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.220
 I used to wear mousse for hair for years. 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.020
 curled up and had even an apologetic reader 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.979
 that he will not remember his name that 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.139
 asked me these days on youtube 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.729
 that she makes herself wore keeps her curls 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.250
 independent of heat and 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.960
 moisture in the street in the rain on the farm is is 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.970
 a snack for curly hair that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.490
 need to eliminate frizz after the use of 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.110
 shampoo and conditioner is to put a 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.630
 small amount in the palm of the hands 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.919
 active and fictionalizing and applying 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.900
 wet hair 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.729
 What I did I already used with this one 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.099
 worked well and safe enough 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.169
 but it works best with another 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:32.979
 crime or more more like this 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.440
 common everyday things that I do step 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.009
 The best way for us to get the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.469
 others 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.330
 I spent a cream on the hair untangles c 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:45.969
 and already left the way I wanted to type 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:48.070
 I will come to the goat capital our super 8 is 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:50.199
 to pass a hair cream the way it 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.270
 I wanted to go there, I'll show you 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:56.969
 Were you waiting for him? 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.969
 that way it's that easy 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:06.159
 I convert myself by applying a 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.590
 position you want is applied in the 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.349
 dry hair type day the next day 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.909
 to see what is not rolled does not roll 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.650
 beautiful only so can not really touch 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.990
 because it obviously gets hard, I tried 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.599
 Even to see how it would look 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.800
 also tested to pass the cream passing 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:25.599
 He's and I really liked it but for me there only 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.330
 he alone for me the best 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.580
 cream was rubbing the 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.000
 hair and finishing with three or 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.580
 three bombs making him money 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.950
 yes and applying was the best way is 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.210
 very good when this time united when 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.500
 it's raining because he gives that 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.030
 Good insurance, then happy is mine. 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.470
 opinion on the line I liked it a lot 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.180
 of the line 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.130
 I only think that it has a small amount in 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.350
 certain products like this one this one here 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.970
 If I'm not mistaken, there's a bigger one then. 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.520
 I can be talking nonsense correct me 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.810
 If you're wrong, please, and where 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.910
 Are you sad that you could not? 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.070
 fail to recognize cream're still here 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.870
 even if you spend too much 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.550
 getting wonderful on the day he stops 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.270
 What I spend looks beautiful on the day. 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.090
 that I pass 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.550
 the other day already he picks which is the 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.340
 volume or anything of the type not it 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.860

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:19.470
 from the bunch it stays the way it is 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.970
 volume only it comes out of the box just this 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.190
 that I was a little upset and 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.990
