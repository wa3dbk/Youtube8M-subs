and<00:00:44.750> what<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> decided<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.770> come<00:00:46.980> out

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
and what we decided to do was come out

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.770 
and what we decided to do was come out
with<00:00:47.250> another<00:00:47.489> line<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.030> influence<00:00:48.600> line

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
with another line the influence line

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
with another line the influence line
which<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> shorter<00:00:49.800> scale<00:00:50.039> carve<00:00:50.940> tops<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
which was a shorter scale carve tops and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.500 
which was a shorter scale carve tops and
so<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> ended<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.379> designing<00:00:53.300> three<00:00:54.300> more

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510

and<00:02:56.600> on<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.930> on

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
and on and on

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.330 
and on and on
because<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:57.590> when<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:57.920> know<00:02:58.100> you're

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
because that's when you know you're

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
because that's when you know you're
getting<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.910> different<00:02:59.480> harmonic<00:03:00.050> levels

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
getting the different harmonic levels

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.979 
getting the different harmonic levels
because<00:03:00.830> those<00:03:01.010> harmonic<00:03:01.580> levels<00:03:01.989> interact

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
because those harmonic levels interact

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.520 
because those harmonic levels interact
with<00:03:03.260> each<00:03:03.410> other<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.920> create<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:05.530> ongoing

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
with each other and create a ongoing

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.740 
with each other and create a ongoing
sound<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.090> all<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.360> can<00:03:08.540> car

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
sound and you can do it all you can car

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.070 
sound and you can do it all you can car
if<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.989> can<00:03:09.140> spray<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:10.100> can<00:03:10.130> build<00:03:10.520> it<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.080> mean

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
if you can spray you can build it I mean

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.190 
if you can spray you can build it I mean
whatever<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.280> needed<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.019> guitar

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.960 
months and then artists guitars which
led<00:03:32.540> him<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.620> getting<00:03:34.190> more<00:03:34.370> involved<00:03:34.640> in

we were going to come up in the future

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.930 
we were going to come up in the future
and<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.380> think<00:03:51.530> yes<00:03:51.950> he's<00:03:52.220> very<00:03:52.310> well<00:03:52.670> known

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
and so I think yes he's very well known

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.449 
and so I think yes he's very well known
really<00:03:53.780> where<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.470> came<00:03:54.560> up<00:03:54.769> with<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.190> idea

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
really where I came up with this idea

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.210 
really where I came up with this idea
the<00:03:55.910> color<00:03:56.120> was<00:03:56.420> driving<00:03:56.930> into<00:03:57.049> work<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.590> looked

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the color was driving into work I looked

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.920 
the color was driving into work I looked
out<00:03:58.370> in<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.579> field<00:03:58.850> and

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
out in the field and

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.580 
out in the field and
burgundy<00:04:00.760> flowers<00:04:01.760> out<00:04:01.970> there<00:04:02.000> with<00:04:02.660> wheat

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
burgundy flowers out there with wheat

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.130 
burgundy flowers out there with wheat
color<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.670> know<00:04:04.820> field<00:04:05.150> behind<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.930> with

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
color you know field behind it with

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.900 
color you know field behind it with
white<00:04:06.440> and<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:07.250> like<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.520> know<00:04:07.640> it'd<00:04:07.760> be<00:04:07.790> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
white and just like you know it'd be a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.020 
white and just like you know it'd be a
cool<00:04:08.120> color<00:04:08.330> combination<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.980> that's<00:04:10.640> kind<00:04:10.910> of

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
cool color combination so that's kind of

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.540 
cool color combination so that's kind of
how<00:04:11.180> I'm<00:04:11.420> looking<00:04:12.230> at<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.530> colors<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.100> stuff

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
how I'm looking at the colors and stuff

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.820 
how I'm looking at the colors and stuff
like<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.030> try<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.390> look<00:04:15.080> at<00:04:15.230> with<00:04:15.350> nature's

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
like that I try to look at with nature's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.340 
like that I try to look at with nature's
side<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.720> know<00:04:17.750> when<00:04:18.080> you<00:04:18.200> look

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
side of it is you know when you look

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.860 
side of it is you know when you look
into<00:04:18.560> what<00:04:18.709> nature<00:04:19.250> does<00:04:19.430> there's<00:04:19.730> some<00:04:19.970> crazy

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
into what nature does there's some crazy

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.960 
into what nature does there's some crazy
color<00:04:21.440> combinations<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.610> would<00:04:22.760> never

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
color combinations that you would never

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.240 
color combinations that you would never
think<00:04:23.150> would<00:04:23.660> work<00:04:24.110> but<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:24.710> look<00:04:24.890> at<00:04:25.010> him<00:04:25.100> go

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
think would work but you look at him go

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.360 
think would work but you look at him go
white<00:04:25.460> has<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.730> studio<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.890> also<00:04:28.040> very

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
white has a studio it's also very

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.820 
white has a studio it's also very
difficult<00:04:28.990> something<00:04:29.990> about<00:04:30.380> this

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.439 

my<00:04:34.520> idea<00:04:34.910> was<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.949> have<00:04:36.949> a<00:04:37.009> lineup<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.970> models

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
my idea was to have a lineup of models

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.939 
my idea was to have a lineup of models
that<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:40.400> know<00:04:40.520> two<00:04:40.580> different<00:04:41.500> lines<00:04:42.500> the

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
that you know two different lines the

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.529 
that you know two different lines the
Chesapeake<00:04:43.430> line<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:43.849> the<00:04:43.909> influence<00:04:44.300> line

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
Chesapeake line and the influence line

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.990 
Chesapeake line and the influence line
that<00:04:45.379> would<00:04:45.620> kind<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.009> have<00:04:46.280> appointments

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
that would kind of have appointments

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.740 
that would kind of have appointments
that<00:04:47.860> these<00:04:48.860> classic<00:04:49.340> instruments<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:50.060> but

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
that these classic instruments have but

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.020 
that these classic instruments have but
also<00:04:52.000> with<00:04:53.000> our<00:04:53.030> own<00:04:53.300> twist<00:04:53.629> and<00:04:53.990> also<00:04:54.740> with

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
also with our own twist and also with

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.980 
also with our own twist and also with
improvements<00:04:56.030> wherever<00:04:56.300> we<00:04:56.509> were<00:04:56.659> able<00:04:56.960> to

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
improvements wherever we were able to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.990 
improvements wherever we were able to
make<00:04:57.229> them<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.759> case<00:04:58.970> of

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
make them and in the case of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.320 
make them and in the case of
Stradivarius<00:04:59.930> he<00:05:00.770> wanted<00:05:01.159> to<00:05:01.430> make

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
Stradivarius he wanted to make

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.300 
Stradivarius he wanted to make
instruments<00:05:03.580> by<00:05:04.580> himself<00:05:05.979> he<00:05:06.979> wanted<00:05:07.220> to

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
instruments by himself he wanted to

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.180
