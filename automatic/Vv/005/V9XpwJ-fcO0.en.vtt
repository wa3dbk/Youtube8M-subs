00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
killing art and this is I think this is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.320 
killing art and this is I think this is
Rika<00:01:18.570> who<00:01:19.259> today<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.150> go

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
such an amazing story if you haven't

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.730 
such an amazing story if you haven't
seen<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.820> anime<00:02:26.210> yet<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.690> would<00:02:27.260> recommend

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
seen the anime yet I would recommend

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.180 
seen the anime yet I would recommend
seeing<00:02:28.070> it<00:02:28.310> because<00:02:28.700> when<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.590> depends<00:02:31.130> on

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
seeing it because when you it depends on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.280 
seeing it because when you it depends on
the<00:02:31.340> way<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:32.120> want<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.720> if<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.960> want<00:02:33.200> to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the way you want to do it if you want to

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.220 
the way you want to do it if you want to
read<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:35.180> manga<00:02:35.450> first<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.720> would<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:39.020> so

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
read the manga first then I would do so

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.360 
read the manga first then I would do so
but<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.860> think<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:41.470> watched<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.680> anime<00:02:42.860> first

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
but I think I watched the anime first

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.280 
but I think I watched the anime first
because<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.760> gives<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.540> lot<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:44.750> details

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
because that gives a lot more details

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.400 
because that gives a lot more details

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
recommend getting it out of all the

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.249 
recommend getting it out of all the
series<00:06:16.800> I<00:06:16.830> have<00:06:17.509> this<00:06:18.509> is<00:06:18.719> probably<00:06:19.020> one<00:06:19.229> of

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
series I have this is probably one of

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.110 
series I have this is probably one of
the<00:06:19.349> ones<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:20.039> would<00:06:20.129> most<00:06:20.490> recommend

the ones that I would most recommend

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.409

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.619 
there's so many artists associated with
announcement<00:06:26.580> one<00:06:26.729> two<00:06:27.090> or<00:06:27.300> three<00:06:27.330> that's

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:27.629
