controller<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.080> worked<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.350> out

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
controller I worked this one out

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.420 
controller I worked this one out
was<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.180> bit<00:00:18.510> complicated<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.410> then<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> found

yourself so how do we set out from here
very<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.199> simple<00:00:52.730> what<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.760> need<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
very very simple what we need to do is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
very very simple what we need to do is
we<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> go<00:00:54.600> into<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.199> options<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
we need to go into the the options and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.880 
we need to go into the the options and
we<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.280> simply<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:57.059> clicking<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:58.050> the

we can do that simply by clicking on the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
we can do that simply by clicking on the
COG<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.870> I<00:01:00.870> bring<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.230> bar<00:01:02.690> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
COG and I bring up this bar this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.469 
COG and I bring up this bar this
preference<00:01:04.229> window<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:05.400> go<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
preference window we go down to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.039 
preference window we go down to
controller<00:01:07.290> manager<00:01:08.060> where<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> says<00:01:09.360> devices

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
controller manager where it says devices

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.039 
controller manager where it says devices
we<00:01:10.380> bring<00:01:10.950> drop<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.400> menu<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.049> select

we bring drop down menu and select
generic<00:01:13.740> MIDI<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.890> MIDI

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
generic MIDI and that will any MIDI

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.210 
generic MIDI and that will any MIDI
controller<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.360> example<00:01:19.220> any

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
controller we have for example any

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.969 
controller we have for example any
controller<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.930> plugged<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
controller like this I plugged in it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.300 
controller like this I plugged in it
will<00:01:23.130> read<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.580> MIDI<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> what

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
will read the MIDI from there so what

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.109 
will read the MIDI from there so what
we're<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:26.970> going<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.010 
we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:01:27.360> play<00:01:27.869> pools<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:30.509> deck

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
start play pools but for this this deck

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
start play pools but for this this deck
a<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> simply<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> by<00:01:33.060> hitting

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a and we can simply do that by hitting

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.240 
a and we can simply do that by hitting
add<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.140> then<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.259> scrolled<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
add in and then we scrolled down to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
add in and then we scrolled down to
transport<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.780> that'll<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.049> our<00:01:40.170> first<00:01:40.200> on

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
transport and that'll be our first on

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.999 
transport and that'll be our first on
the<00:01:40.860> list<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.490> called<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> play<00:01:42.270> pause

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the list which is called a play pause

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.780 
the list which is called a play pause
like<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.600> then<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.990> hit<00:01:46.290> learn<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.610> now

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
like so and then we hit learn and now

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
like so and then we hit learn and now
from<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> select<00:01:49.020> any<00:01:49.170> button<00:01:49.470> we

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
from here we just select any button we

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.359 
from here we just select any button we
wants<00:01:49.950> I'll<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.119> hit<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:52.009> yeah<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.220> one

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
wants I'll just hit this yeah this one

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
wants I'll just hit this yeah this one
will<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.180> it's<00:01:57.180> come<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.110> showed

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
will do and now it's come up and showed

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:10.140 
will do and now it's come up and showed
us<00:01:58.860> our<00:01:59.040> MIDI<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.659> now<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.810> unload

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.180 

now<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.260> another<00:02:12.500> problem<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:12.980> might

have<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.560> holding<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> button<00:02:16.310> down

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
have it's just holding the button down

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
have it's just holding the button down
once<00:02:16.790> you've<00:02:16.940> done<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:18.260> plays<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> track

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
once you've done that it plays the track

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.370 
once you've done that it plays the track
once<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.400> release<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:19.850> you're<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.570> bow<00:02:20.720> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.590 
once your release if you're the bow it
will<00:02:21.530> pause<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.240> overcome<00:02:23.450> that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
will pause it we can overcome that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.590 
will pause it we can overcome that

down the drop-down menu and hit toggle
so<00:02:37.130> I'll<00:02:37.400> toggle<00:02:37.730> on<00:02:37.880> or<00:02:37.910> toggle<00:02:38.240> off<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.830> play

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
so I'll toggle on or toggle off and play

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.430 
so I'll toggle on or toggle off and play
and<00:02:40.190> pause<00:02:40.340> very<00:02:41.000> simple<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:41.960> go<00:02:42.110> like

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
and pause very simple so if we go like

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:59.950 
and pause very simple so if we go like
this

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.850 

okay<00:03:00.960> so<00:03:01.070> how<00:03:02.070> do<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.370> MIDI<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.960> MIDI<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
okay so how do we get MIDI the MIDI to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.700 
okay so how do we get MIDI the MIDI to
show<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> LEDs<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.850> here<00:03:06.470> that's<00:03:07.470> another

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
show the LEDs on here that's another

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.830 
show the LEDs on here that's another
very<00:03:08.010> simple<00:03:08.460> simple<00:03:09.500> thing<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.710> do<00:03:10.830> let's<00:03:11.070> say

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
very simple simple thing to do let's say

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.980 
very simple simple thing to do let's say
we<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:13.170> an<00:03:13.860> ad<00:03:13.980> out<00:03:14.220> burn<00:03:14.550> we<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.660> click<00:03:15.840> that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
we have an ad out burn we can click that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.130 
we have an ad out burn we can click that
and<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.340> where<00:03:17.490> we<00:03:17.610> select<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.870> same

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
and this is where we select the same

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.370 
and this is where we select the same
preference<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.880> we<00:03:21.240> selected<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.900> player<00:03:22.140> pools

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
preference so we selected a player pools

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.510 
preference so we selected a player pools
burn<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:23.490> do<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.760> again<00:03:24.060> by<00:03:24.840> hitting

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
burn we do that again by hitting

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.380 
burn we do that again by hitting
transport<00:03:26.520> play<00:03:26.910> pause<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:29.120> we<00:03:30.120> need<00:03:30.300> to

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
transport play pause and we need to

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.770 
transport play pause and we need to
select<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.750> button<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.260> well<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.600> this<00:03:33.720> is

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
select the button as well so this is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.400 
select the button as well so this is
this<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.380> where<00:03:34.530> we<00:03:34.650> go<00:03:34.800> into<00:03:34.980> our<00:03:35.360> pictures

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
this is where we go into our pictures

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.550 
this is where we go into our pictures
that<00:03:37.410> we've<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.850> brought<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:40.380> will

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
that we've just brought and this will

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.450 
that we've just brought and this will
tell<00:03:40.710> us<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.860> Le<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.580> MIDI<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.360> LEDs<00:03:43.460> we

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
tell us the Le the MIDI for the LEDs we

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.660 
tell us the Le the MIDI for the LEDs we
had<00:03:44.670> 17<00:03:45.270> here<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.410> could<00:03:46.590> scroll<00:03:47.040> down<00:03:47.310> to

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
had 17 here so we could scroll down to

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.600 
had 17 here so we could scroll down to
17<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:48.840> our<00:03:49.350> LED<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.480> c4<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.160> go<00:03:53.280> back<00:03:53.430> into

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
17 and our LED is c4 and we go back into

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.870 
17 and our LED is c4 and we go back into
tractor<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.890> where<00:03:55.890> we've<00:03:56.010> got<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.340> device

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
tractor and where we've got the device

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
tractor and where we've got the device
mapping<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.320> big<00:03:58.500> drop-down<00:03:58.800> menu<00:03:59.160> we

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
mapping in this big drop-down menu we

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.660 
mapping in this big drop-down menu we
select<00:03:59.670> here<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.660> can<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.960> channel<00:04:01.350> 1<00:04:01.560> we<00:04:02.550> go

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
select here we can go to channel 1 we go

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.190 
select here we can go to channel 1 we go
to<00:04:02.730> notes<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.650> our<00:04:04.650> mapping<00:04:05.250> caused<00:04:05.550> c4<00:04:06.510> so<00:04:07.080> we

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
to notes and our mapping caused c4 so we

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.840 
to notes and our mapping caused c4 so we
scroll<00:04:07.560> down<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:08.160> c4<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.440> select<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.560> that
