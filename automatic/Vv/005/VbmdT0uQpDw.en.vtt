and with the shifter itself and both

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.999 
and with the shifter itself and both
worked<00:05:00.110> very<00:05:00.169> well

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.219 

kind<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.580> like<00:05:03.789> I've<00:05:03.969> driven<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.419> mint<00:05:04.629> Maserati

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.279 
kind of like I've driven a mint Maserati
and<00:05:05.499> it<00:05:05.620> reacts<00:05:06.249> a<00:05:06.370> lot<00:05:06.610> like<00:05:06.849> that<00:05:07.120> I'll<00:05:08.110> look

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
and it reacts a lot like that I'll look

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.519 
and it reacts a lot like that I'll look
up<00:05:08.439> the<00:05:08.469> specs<00:05:08.949> on<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.729> transmission<00:05:10.529> and

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
up the specs on the transmission and

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:19.890 
up the specs on the transmission and
stuffed<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:13.029> verify<00:05:13.509> it<00:05:13.569> for<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:18.900> signal

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
stuffed to verify it for you signal

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.709 
stuffed to verify it for you signal
light<00:05:20.520> did<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.699> shift<00:05:21.939> down<00:05:22.150> on<00:05:22.360> its<00:05:22.509> own

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
light did that shift down on its own

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.989 
light did that shift down on its own
look<00:05:23.590> at<00:05:23.770> an<00:05:23.860> automatic<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:25.360> we'll<00:05:25.569> shift<00:05:25.840> down

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:26.999 
look at an automatic so we'll shift down

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.800 
look at an automatic so we'll shift down
but<00:05:27.999> it<00:05:28.330> doesn't<00:05:28.840> want<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.169> shift<00:05:29.439> up<00:05:30.810> unless

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
but it doesn't want to shift up unless

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.529 
but it doesn't want to shift up unless
you<00:05:32.050> shift<00:05:32.349> it<00:05:32.560> now<00:05:33.550> another<00:05:34.060> point<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.509> just

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
you shift it now another point I just

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.309 
you shift it now another point I just
took<00:05:35.080> a<00:05:35.139> right-hand<00:05:35.710> turn<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:37.449> left<00:05:37.779> side

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
took a right-hand turn and the left side

pressure<00:05:41.919> on<00:05:42.129> my<00:05:42.370> body<00:05:42.610> so<00:05:43.539> that<00:05:43.569> I<00:05:43.750> wouldn't

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
pressure on my body so that I wouldn't

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.670 
pressure on my body so that I wouldn't
feel<00:05:44.319> so<00:05:44.560> much<00:05:44.710> body<00:05:45.129> roll
