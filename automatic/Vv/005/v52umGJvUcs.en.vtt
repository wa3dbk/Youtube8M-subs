00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 is such a kind of settlers online for 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.149
 android the hans mahr very gently 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.049
 definitely write clash of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.839
 plants it's just about as good as 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.209
 possible to have exposed village and 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.549
 the best in the ranking 

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:58.649
 which we can see down here best 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.739
 clear we can enter a clear 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.059
 if we built a small castle 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 or best player just stop here 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.170
 landeseiten has 4061 trophies 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640
 player with the most trophies 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.040
 get trophies if the other one 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.130
 attack players 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.660
 we'll see them up there 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.730
 and so we come in too 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.920
 There are different ones that we see here 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.250
 bronze silver gold crystal and so on 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.560
 next and so on and a 1 league 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 There is always a season, as always 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.710
 two weeks and at the end of the season 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.700
 You have to stick to it when you're around 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.500
 the first three of this league is us 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.370
 see ours up here now 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.750
 Elixir Collector is the name of the thing here 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.940
 Because that is what we are called here in our 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.020
 Clicks of your situation that means we build 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.910
 best under here 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.910
 Resource information no change 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.009
 Africans are building okay because it always depends 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.240
 everything from athos stage from the council 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.250
 is all the more stuff could dive 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.750
 warp by ziegler then we upgrade 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.509
 just the elixier situation of lasted 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.659
 30 minutes we could theoretically 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.570
 with here at the side of these jewels 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.030
 Of course we want to accelerate here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.560
 we get the real money back 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.209
 but they also get by us here 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.690
 For example, remove such a mushroom 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.310
 It would take ten seconds 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.190
 it is a coincidence if you remove something 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.170
 stones bushes everything then it can be 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.010
 that jewels do not have to come out at 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.480
 get necessarily keep up 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.250
 we have two buildings that means we 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.549
 can share 24 orders at the same time 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.470
 another hut costs 400 jewels 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.750
 I find that a bit silly because it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 then it takes a long time to get there 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.810
 Something has done in any case 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.299
 there are many buildings in a barracks 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.160
 now here at the beginning 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.600
 we can create warriors a maximum of 20 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.370
 places for you to print those we 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.049
 But first we get barracks 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.000
 could upgrade with court too 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.239
 that's what our water is all about 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.070
 Mine is a warrior or yeah ok 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.320
 We can also cancel if we have one 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.239
 have laboratory I find that when we 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.340
 allmedia a lab that did not work until 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.900
 entering the town hall is and 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.190
 so on and on like armin shield 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.019
 we can not be attacked though 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.370
 we get the buy this shield 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.840
 we automatically activated when we 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.310
 be attacked and we will 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.500
 we definitely get defeated 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.180
 opted for 24 hours can 24 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 did not succeed in being attacked 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.079
 ok i have to say i know the app 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.390
 so far not luca said the airbus 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.800
 good the military service 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.569
 so sit and accept nickelsdorf 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.520
 with my head around and make and go 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.410
 again something like that here and dazzle 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.900
 funny wars just in any case 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.440
 yes how is it with the with the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.550
 So play online until the asta in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.380
 Other game like can be here below 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.090
 attack so there was only a few 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.239
 Incidentally, I am currently training dead ones 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.340
 not fruit then we do that 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.030
 abort, stop 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.650
 or stop right now 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.930
 we have him warrior on our gates 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.519
 Place in stock now has a specific 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.470
 capacity we can also expand 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.670
 if a new angela brown upgrade that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.750
 we can attack here we can 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.610
 fight offline against goblins here 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.340
 three stars maximum for every move 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.640
 if we destroyed the whole camp 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.019
 but there are no prophets or 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.040
 We went to find the fight 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.209
 would have to lose now because 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.790
 already in 2008 and fight here against 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.700
 another player we have 25 here 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.139
 to put concerts or another 50 gold 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.729
 to pay us another opponent 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.260
 if the officer is too strong 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.200
 Seems like that probably anyway 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.090
 Do everything internally with two opponents 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.600
 we can remember may build 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.890
 so we are frequently attacked 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.700
 well lost 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.060
 In any case if we win 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.000
 we get raw materials and we have 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.040
 Now this funny bird has like that 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.040
 a new one that means we get 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.390
 yes let the beasts unlocked 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.390
 archer in the barn free that 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.290
 We did it because we work in principle 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.180
 hope we have ten 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.650
 Experience points and five years old 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.480
 That's how we can get Julien 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.480
 here on the page we can in 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.460
 completely write the official team or 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.720
 in planitz opinions this clear 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.340
 but can only make moves here 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.400
 this sound castle had built again 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.840
 So a very complex game and you 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.980
 It may not be that good now 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.450
 we explain as we can pull 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.340
 give only rough overview 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.540
 but you can just get down yourself 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.940
 and look what I want the game myself 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.530
 I actually quite cool indeed a 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.030
 typical strategy game with neat 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.830
 content behind it where a bit something 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.570
 to try out a little something too 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.130
 build as planned and so on and on 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.500
 So far as you know, in principle, you see 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.030
 recognize what you should actually know 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.470
 and what strategy plays then know 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.520
 her actually was informed on 1 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.200
 because I wanted to me to find 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.400
 him just so dangerous guy me 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.770
 just wanted to smooth out one more time 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.070
 but still wanted to give the information 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.320
 that we tested version 5.5 2.11 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.180
 have the goal over the normal tariffs 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.090
 2013 comes somehow 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.690
 networks values bugs or fdp I have 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.670
 me okay now enlightened with 640 mb 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.370
 download it and I play a lot 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:15.000
 class free templates the 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.000
 Developer super send brings 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.800
 yes the game with the fire for ios and 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.560
 came to the end I actually have 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.850
 always waiting for it 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.350
 I can not have it better here 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.610
 we said look at you even says 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.930
 all right then i would mind 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.370
 Trust and that too 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.500
 look at how easy cosmetics camera 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.050
 Just try it while you 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.160
 you can still have a few troops out loud 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:42.020
 maybe this cycle again 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.020
 and see you soon see
