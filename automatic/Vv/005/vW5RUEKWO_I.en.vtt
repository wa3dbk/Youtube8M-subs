00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just because of copyright reasons but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.749 
just because of copyright reasons but

it's really cool see you there is it's
mostly<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> feel<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.920> big<00:01:56.280> reason

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
mostly this I feel like a big reason

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.880 
mostly this I feel like a big reason
they<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.750> Netflix<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.590> very

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
they did this was for Netflix it's very

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
they did this was for Netflix it's very
easy<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:01.140> bit

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
easy and it just it's a little bit

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.690 
easy and it just it's a little bit
better<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.680> remote<00:02:01.950> experience<00:02:02.549> rather

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
better of a remote experience rather

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.459 
better of a remote experience rather
than<00:02:02.850> using<00:02:03.119> your<00:02:03.390> standard<00:02:03.840> controller<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
than using your standard controller that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.109 
than using your standard controller that
most<00:02:04.710> people<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> use<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.909> they

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
most people have to use because they

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.380 
most people have to use because they
don't<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> media<00:02:06.750> remote<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:09.270> also

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
don't have a media remote so I can also

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.029

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
last example there I'm going to launch

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320 
last example there I'm going to launch
at<00:02:56.650> mono<00:02:56.890> warfare<00:02:57.310> 3<00:02:57.490> which<00:02:57.670> happens<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.120> in

at mono warfare 3 which happens to be in
my<00:02:58.480> xbox<00:02:58.810> right<00:02:58.990> now<00:02:59.200> it<00:02:59.590> goes<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.950> plate

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
my xbox right now it goes to the plate

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.949 
my xbox right now it goes to the plate
map<00:03:00.340> screen<00:03:00.610> I'll<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.060> have<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.270> do<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.510> tap<00:03:01.750> a

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
map screen I'll I have to do is tap a

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.800 
map screen I'll I have to do is tap a
and<00:03:02.550> there<00:03:03.550> it<00:03:03.790> will<00:03:03.940> launch<00:03:04.150> out<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.600> game

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
and there it will launch out the game

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.670 
and there it will launch out the game
for<00:03:05.110> me<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:06.209> really<00:03:07.209> launch<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.660> any<00:03:07.900> sort<00:03:08.620> of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
for me so I really launch up any sort of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.949 
for me so I really launch up any sort of
application<00:03:08.830> right<00:03:09.550> from<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.060> iPhone<00:03:10.600> and

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
application right from your iPhone and

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.110 
application right from your iPhone and
you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.290> control<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.890> menus<00:03:12.250> use<00:03:12.850> as<00:03:13.090> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you can control the menus use as a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.490 
you can control the menus use as a
controller<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.900> course<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.140> can't<00:03:14.350> play

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
controller of course you can't play

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.199 
controller of course you can't play
games<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.100> but<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.520> would<00:03:15.820> be<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:15.940> little

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
games with it but that would be a little

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.610 
games with it but that would be a little
ridiculous<00:03:16.420> anyway<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.880> that's<00:03:19.269> pretty<00:03:20.140> much

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
ridiculous anyway so that's pretty much

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.699 
ridiculous anyway so that's pretty much
