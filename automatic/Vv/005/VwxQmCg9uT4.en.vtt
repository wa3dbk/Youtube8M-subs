00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 sure the table firmly lukas notes 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 while lukas was stuck here people 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.269
 is again gray star makes a suitcase 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 under vista and lukas 26 we are right 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 continue with our shipbuilding 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 competition ratings today the nms 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.529
 crown king 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
 I have to say that nice 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.320
 My fuselage has not used yet 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 while the very sorry 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.380
 max i know what was last what 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.480
 So we meant before we did 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 taken with rescue boat over there in front 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.649
 a kind of caribbean because of rescue boat 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.149
 probably in the water because that one 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.450
 be authentic between this 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 world hit land and this ship can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590
 you do not actually feel anything directly 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.120
 white oriented at the old now 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.770
 already wonder why a perfect 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.469
 then the ship is intact here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.960
 lifeboats to water but leaves well 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.260
 to know what we want from falls are 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.480
 yes in any case is a mixture of 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.980
 Elements of 2 taken over 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.019
 you find some fans already very much 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.510
 good is a plus point he has one 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.250
 is in derogation of the feeling even eat 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.350
 quite normally it has the chance 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.630
 externally to get 20 points but 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.610
 I would say yes it is nothing 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:26.040
 bad have modern and classic 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 Aspects of cinema screen 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.439
 Of course I 'm happy if that's the case 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.020
 Heavy sea is the then 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:41.700
 and so I'm sure I'll do it right away 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.329
 times the shaved place the boxes are 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.410
 drive 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:49.270
 Anna is almost me advertising revenue front 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.590
 why do not we have to do that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.370
 Maybe it 'll take two years to look 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.180
 somehow succumbed 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.920
 Well, anyway , what would you do? 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.670
 say lucas tri from outward what 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 rate equal time 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.270
 some things i like a few 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.890
 things I find less bread 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.390
 yes, especially the book I really want 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 really good with the helicopter 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 landing place forward which I also right 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 schnuckelig find here is this 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.280
 Bollards to gamble that the normalized 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.760
 are extra island we have that right 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.070
 hot 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 He was hÃ¼ck details that respected 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.660
 I really do not care 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.370
 Of course, this cream is clear 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.140
 I'm not sure what's up here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.640
 Give here because here is so now 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.910
 We have two cranes for the loupe like 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.290
 Ladeluke whether you are in the helicopter with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.989
 to move the crow is mine now 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.239
 not really much less 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.940
 now like this is huge here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.220
 glass front so here all this glass 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.830
 purely that I find less beautiful now 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.150
 I think that makes the picture too 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.549
 a bit broken so I think you would have 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.660
 up there or down close his glass of wine 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.560
 can do and hold up or down 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.950
 can make outdoor cabins or what also 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 always 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.900
 So that's glassy for the comedians 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.549
 was said but good what would you do 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.549
 say how many points are there from 20 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.610
 I would say give it a chance 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.380
 So we also give it now 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.299
 maybe given to 18 by the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.430
 Overall impression her so all this holds 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.430
 really nice 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.510
 thanks and what I really cool 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.269
 you will find yourself later at the 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.519
 illuminate functionality even closer 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.220
 I add wills same time is the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.900
 Idea that you are still here in the back 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.160
 it looks orange but are 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.709
 rescue boats in there and you can 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.709
 through this freight hatch above quasi 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.660
 rausholen and extra only unfortunately 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.340
 is it so that neither davids nor here 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.739
 again lifeboat know somehow 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.980
 davids present her after me than me 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.090
 I always think I'm standing outside 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.790
 that means the shit is likely 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.079
 because against you here in the water can 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.459
 In any case, if there is still a bit 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.230
 the technology would have been respected 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.420
 if it has been a perfect system 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.250
 so there's obviously just a little 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.730
 deduction but that's alright it works 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.550
 even so it stays at 17 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.440
 I do not want to sit down now 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.049
 forgive so written on it stays here 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.540
 that I would have given 18 almost 18 now 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.100
 but we sit and are good for it 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.859
 maybe generous with another 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.510
 point outfit so we want now 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.070
 move our first wine directly or 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.960
 because I'll do it my ass first 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.160
 Just move in exactly and I have 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.360
 I'll look at it now 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.740
 do not go in everywhere because so much 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.940
 We do not have time, I also want to 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.040
 not that the video here is endlessly long 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.110
 but i want to be so closed 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.190
 were 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.350
 I really just want to 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.199
 show the main rooms and also 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.550
 I bridge that I already like that 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:47.430
 what gives me absolutely there is in the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.740
 functions through so long to reality 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.410
 there is no light on the back why is on 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.820
 the bridge is not lying lukas yes that is 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.039
 so if he is not like the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.800
 drive a car at some point you see stop 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.120
 nothing more that's somehow there 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.130
 you 're driving yourself you know that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.940
 then there is no light on 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.919
 you hardly see any progress when I am 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.599
 I've never seen a ship before 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.220
 what the balance in the harbor is a miracle 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:16.760
 print court since the nada 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.760
 cheaper and something 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.760
 So of course he has here and there himself 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.930
 a small suitcase made now not 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.490
 on the bridge or the many 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.289
 davis for that he was at others 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.800
 again make good things like 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.430
 life jackets boxes eg staircase adu 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.479
 the stairwell is also very private what 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:44.310
 I somehow weird think it funny 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:47.760
 there is however where zb davis that is 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.590
 is that I have just found 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.940
 I think the staircase is not 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.289
 so bad for that too 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.229
 A classic ship is almost 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.300
 wooden ceiling and that's no different 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.069
 Yes 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.960
 so it is best to go again 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.960
 at random somewhere there is 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.900
 besides , time costs precious time around this 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.669
 is great to build ships with 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.159
 beautiful plants that I find a good 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.129
 idea because the leaves of ships too 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:21.830
 times a legal make the media 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.120
 place on ahead as bewegungs course 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.699
 also with your ships and if the 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.379
 good ideas from 80 pages this funny 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.879
 effect there you have almost investigator and 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.979
 that has to get what even robin 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.389
 kastens gets well the victory it was 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.099
 Not a bad boss in any case here 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.190
 Most of the cinema in it is not synonymous 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.139
 bad really beautiful cinema halls times 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.210
 So it was grounded that he was down 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.580
 really put in evidence here 's 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.539
 With one extra they staircase we idec 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.889
 Just go through it now 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:46.699
 I can not ship through 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.729
 to see everything 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.020
 here are the bands of electro gas 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:55.009
 not as fast moving easy it is 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:13.639
 also purposefully moving plants on 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:14.690
 the ground that's the cracks still 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:16.310
 some and theater I think I was 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.279
 At the very bottom I'll go up the stairwell 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.949
 far below and now I'm up 

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:25.180
 There was no need for the theater here 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.180
 get some rest already 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.960
 Ringat yet he still has an extra 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:34.629
 theater I believe in the bottom of it 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.629
 hull which is the same course then
