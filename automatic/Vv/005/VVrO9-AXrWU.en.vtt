 Hi, I'm Mariana and today we're going to prepare 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.170
 a very fresh salad with a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.880
 citrus vinaigrette we start by 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.160
 put our lettuces we have our 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.250
 lettuce in cold water because that's how it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.789
 they keep more crispy and we're going to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.609
 chop to a size where it's bite 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 with our hands if they have a 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.089
 little bit of water , nothing of the same happens 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 way we chop our spinach 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:43.170
 then we integrate our beetle that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.230
 it is previously cooked 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.019
 let's cut a few sheets of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.449
 peppermint so we're going to 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.679
 put we are going to cut in halves the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 Tomato kerry diagonally looks like 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.089
 nothing else for per presentation we take 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.089
 a few sheets of the roller and cut them into 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.089
 Julian 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.659
 and we integrated our salad this 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.509
 it gives us a different flavor but also 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.509
 a lot of color we add our feta cheese 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.580
 and finally the sunflower seeds 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.590
 and now let's prepare our 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 vinaigrette where we already have matches here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.290
 our lemons and a vinaigrette from 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.840
 citrus then we are putting lemon 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.140
 yellow pardon lincoln green and lemon 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140
 yellow 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.050
 a splash of white wine vinegar 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.810
 as well 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.540
 give us another touch 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.540
 it has been but not so citrus 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.050
 with a beater we will integrate 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.490
 our olive oil in the form of thread 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.490
 so that he goes emotional 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.080
 We try our vinaigrette and see if it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.170
 It takes a bit of 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 salt we can integrate it already in our 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.560
 salad is recommended that the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.420
 vinaigrette is integrated just before the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.990
 time to serve the salad and not so much 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.210
 time before because it will lower us 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.580
 all the lettuce is going to be very 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.610
 heavy 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.610
 and will lose a bit of freshness 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.860
 Minister, we are ready to have a 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.900
 super cool salad supplement 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.140
 for any talk I hope that you 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.140
 like
