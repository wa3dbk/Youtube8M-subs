00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 next you will see secrets and thorough 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:14.519
 washing and washing machine seemingly 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.670
 washing machine only mixes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.279
 clothes with water and powder but this is not yet 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 everything does not end her work 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 when clothes absorb water she 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.650
 it becomes three times harder and after 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 washing machine face a new challenge 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:40.920
 spinning after directly washing it 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 the most important function of a washing machine for 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 time jim from mode and drums 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.180
 subjected to enormous loads 500 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.440
 times the force of gravity 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.460
 This result is achieved thanks to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.530
 centrifugal force 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.140
 all this in order to squeeze well 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:03.160
 clothes let's find out more in front 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.809
 you have a washing machine bank 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.570
 inside the drum tank with a big 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.770
 number of holes 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 and on the back of the car an electric motor 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.200
 during washing water is collected in the tank 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.130
 drum spinning thereby 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.719
 thing 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.280
 when i wash the water runs out 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.960
 discharged from the tank 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 now the clothes feel but she weighs 3 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 times more due to soaked in water 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.460
 now the most difficult begins 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 work we drink water from a cloth by 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.740
 centrifugal force to find out how 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.740
 let 's just sort out the machine 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.850
 not yet 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.260
 clean but to wear lies at the bottom of the drum 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.340
 to survive the water the drum must 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.340
 spinning at high speed 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.100
 the drum rotates at a speed of 13,000 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.020
 rpm 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.390
 this rotation creates breakdown force 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.060
 which you need to squeeze water from 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.920
 fibers to this movement is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.850
 real test for water droplets 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.850
 remaining in Komi 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.360
 if we suddenly removed the drum wall 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.160
 clothes would fly by inertia with 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.160
 speed of 140 kilometers an hour 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.110
 night or inertia and oppose the wall 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.590
 drum returning fabric back center 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.590
 drum 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.909
 clothes cannot fly off 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.269
 the drum she stumbles upon a solid 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.269
 wall 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.750
 Well, Nastya as a drum is full of a hole 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.950
 rather than being able to keep cann 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.950
 able to hold water drops 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.300
 inertia drops of water and squeeze them out 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.900
 tissue and they are passing from the hole 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.880
 out of the car the drum wall is not 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.680
 stops them unlike most 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.940
 fabrics 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.950
 as the drum continues to spin 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.720
 clothes still rests on the wall 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.720
 allowing water to flow into the hole 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.130
 nrc clothes constantly stick her to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.450
 the walls so the process is not 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.450
 stops for a second 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.580
 for you to sew clothes of a washing machine 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.770
 use centrifugal force which 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.960
 consists of two phenomena of inertia in 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.860
 one direction and restoring force 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.860
 of good 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.670
 but such processes occur in 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.730
 washing machine while washing 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.950
 machine essentially after she 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.580
 cleans the thing of dirt it cleans them still 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.580
 times from the water 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.610
 using these simple physical 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.340
 phenomena in the washing machine are capable 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.340
 survive 75 percent water from clothes 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.180
 she leaves only a quarter of water for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.289
 self drying 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.020
 washing machine calls for help 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:06.479
 laws of physics to squeeze water out of your 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.479
 clothes interesting
