in<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> meta<00:04:50.490> right<00:04:50.730> now<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:52.230> reason<00:04:52.500> that

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
in the meta right now the reason that

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.050 
in the meta right now the reason that
they<00:04:54.420> did<00:04:54.660> not<00:04:54.690> top<00:04:55.140> ycs<00:04:55.830> anaheim<00:04:56.370> like<00:04:56.790> in<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
they did not top ycs anaheim like in the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.540 
they did not top ycs anaheim like in the
top<00:04:57.240> 16<00:04:57.570> or<00:04:57.870> whatever<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.350> because<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.400> can

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
top 16 or whatever is because you can

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.730 
top 16 or whatever is because you can
sign<00:04:59.820> in<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:00.210> many<00:05:00.390> cards<00:05:00.750> against<00:05:01.170> it<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.530> that

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
sign in so many cards against it so that

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.280 
sign in so many cards against it so that
is<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.160> one<00:05:02.400> drawback<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.600> deck<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:04.050> that

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
is the one drawback of the deck is that

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.760 
is the one drawback of the deck is that

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
it can be cited in against so easily but

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.440
