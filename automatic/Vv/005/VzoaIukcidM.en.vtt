and<00:02:18.180> over<00:02:18.420> here<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> decals<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.340> are

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
and over here with the decals these are

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.199 
and over here with the decals these are
pretty<00:02:20.760> much<00:02:21.560> exactly<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.800> same<00:02:23.209> no

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
pretty much exactly the same no

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.260 
pretty much exactly the same no
differences<00:02:24.810> anywhere<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:26.130> hurdal<00:02:26.880> version

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
differences anywhere the hurdal version

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.360 
differences anywhere the hurdal version
has<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:28.140> extra<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.740> part<00:02:29.010> numbers

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
has a little bit extra with part numbers

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.020 
has a little bit extra with part numbers
and<00:02:29.580> stuff<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:31.590> original<00:02:32.040> MPC<00:02:32.550> was<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> bit

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and stuff the original MPC was a bit

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.910 
and stuff the original MPC was a bit
more<00:02:33.240> conservative<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.500> let<00:02:34.650> me<00:02:34.740> get<00:02:34.890> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
more conservative so let me get a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.690 
more conservative so let me get a
close-up<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.459> these<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:38.310> we've<00:02:38.459> got<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
close-up of these so here we've got the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.290 
close-up of these so here we've got the
1980<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.920> black<00:02:41.459> lettering<00:02:41.880> there<00:02:42.150> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
1980 all the black lettering there is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.590 
1980 all the black lettering there is
pretty<00:02:42.510> much<00:02:42.630> illegible<00:02:43.940> same<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.360> side

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
pretty much illegible same for this side

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.050 
pretty much illegible same for this side
as<00:02:45.840> well<00:02:49.130> otherwise<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.370> too<00:02:50.610> much<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.030> say

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
as well otherwise not too much to say

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.900 
as well otherwise not too much to say
here<00:02:57.290> one<00:02:58.290> big<00:02:58.530> fold-out<00:02:58.980> instruction<00:02:59.670> sheet

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
here one big fold-out instruction sheet

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.870 
here one big fold-out instruction sheet
for<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.300> one<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.040> same<00:03:02.250> for<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.610> one

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
for that one and the same for this one

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.520 
for that one and the same for this one
just<00:03:03.060> fold<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.600> little<00:03:03.780> differently<00:03:04.260> with

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
just fold it a little differently with

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.740 
just fold it a little differently with
the<00:03:04.620> different<00:03:05.010> cover<00:03:05.269> which<00:03:06.269> means<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the different cover which means the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.180 
the different cover which means the
backside<00:03:07.260> should<00:03:07.590> change<00:03:09.620> now<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:10.950> just

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
backside should change now they just

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.930 
backside should change now they just
shifted<00:03:11.580> everything<00:03:11.970> over<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.480> eliminated

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
shifted everything over and eliminated

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.290 
shifted everything over and eliminated
did<00:03:14.940> they

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
did they

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.290 
did they
I<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.380> shrunk<00:03:16.680> these<00:03:16.950> two<00:03:17.300> from

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
I see they just shrunk these two from

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.229 
I see they just shrunk these two from
these<00:03:18.510> two<00:03:19.430> yeah<00:03:20.430> basically<00:03:21.000> they<00:03:21.209> just

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
these two yeah basically they just

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.390 
these two yeah basically they just
shrunk<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.140> instructions<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.070> this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
shrunk all the instructions so this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.390 
shrunk all the instructions so this
whole<00:03:23.640> three<00:03:23.970> page<00:03:24.239> here<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:25.010> squashed<00:03:26.010> into

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
whole three page here is squashed into

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.920 
whole three page here is squashed into
just<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:27.470> page<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.709> half<00:03:28.739> there<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> let's

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
just a page and a half there so let's

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.720 
just a page and a half there so let's
take<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> look<00:03:31.350> at<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> actual<00:03:31.680> plastic<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
take a look at the actual plastic so I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.449 
take a look at the actual plastic so I
look<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.180> each<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.720> four<00:03:37.440> screw<00:03:37.830> over<00:03:38.010> plus

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
look to each of the four screw over plus

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.120 
look to each of the four screw over plus
the<00:03:38.670> main<00:03:38.850> body<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.660> parts<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.769> layout

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the main body and the parts the layout

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.180 
the main body and the parts the layout
looks<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:41.970> exactly<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.810> same<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:44.010> same

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
looks to be exactly the same the same

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.910 
looks to be exactly the same the same
blemishes<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.180> same<00:03:45.390> fine<00:03:45.750> details<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.709> same

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
blemishes the same fine details the same

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.250 
blemishes the same fine details the same
everything

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.750 

they<00:03:51.260> definitely<00:03:51.530> put<00:03:51.980> some<00:03:52.160> effort<00:03:52.489> into

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
they definitely put some effort into

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:01.119 
they definitely put some effort into
doing<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:59.110> that<00:04:00.110> control<00:04:00.530> panel<00:04:00.560> looks

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
doing this that control panel looks

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.080 
doing this that control panel looks
really<00:04:01.519> great<00:04:01.730> specifically<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:04.610> over<00:04:04.849> here

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
really great specifically and over here

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.880 
really great specifically and over here
on<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.330> body<00:04:05.540> itself<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.410> lot<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.580> veins

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
on the body itself a lot of the veins

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.580 
on the body itself a lot of the veins
all<00:04:09.890> of<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.280> scribing<00:04:11.019> really<00:04:12.019> well<00:04:12.170> done

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.780 

can't<00:04:15.590> say<00:04:15.769> a<00:04:15.799> word<00:04:15.830> that<00:04:16.130> there's<00:04:16.340> really<00:04:16.519> too

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
can't say a word that there's really too

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.920 
can't say a word that there's really too
much<00:04:16.940> flash<00:04:17.269> or<00:04:17.600> anything<00:04:17.840> else<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.900> is

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
much flash or anything else there is

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.510 
much flash or anything else there is
some<00:04:21.380> molding<00:04:22.250> blemishes<00:04:22.910> going<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.510> but<00:04:24.520> it's

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
some molding blemishes going on but it's

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.940 
some molding blemishes going on but it's
not<00:04:25.580> too<00:04:25.910> big<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> deal<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:27.290> only<00:04:27.560> actual

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
not too big a deal the only actual

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.620 
not too big a deal the only actual
difference<00:04:28.490> between<00:04:28.940> these<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:31.360> here<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.479> got

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
difference between these is here we got

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.219 
difference between these is here we got
the<00:04:32.810> 89<00:04:33.290> Erdal<00:04:33.680> logo<00:04:34.040> stamp<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
the 89 Erdal logo stamp and on the

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.530 
the 89 Erdal logo stamp and on the
opposite<00:04:36.710> wing<00:04:36.889> we've<00:04:37.310> got<00:04:37.580> fun<00:04:37.910> dimensions

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
opposite wing we've got fun dimensions

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.760 
opposite wing we've got fun dimensions
from<00:04:39.440> 1980<00:04:40.419> if<00:04:41.419> that's<00:04:41.720> showing<00:04:42.169> up<00:04:42.320> there<00:04:42.590> we

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
from 1980 if that's showing up there we

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.310 
from 1980 if that's showing up there we
go<00:04:45.610> other<00:04:46.610> than<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.940> pretty<00:04:47.630> much<00:04:47.900> looks<00:04:48.169> to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
go other than that pretty much looks to

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.779 
go other than that pretty much looks to
be<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.440> same<00:04:48.560> if<00:04:48.949> you're<00:04:49.100> looking<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.460> get<00:04:49.580> one

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
be the same if you're looking to get one

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.700 
be the same if you're looking to get one
of<00:04:49.910> these<00:04:50.060> go<00:04:50.720> for<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.020> cheaper<00:04:51.380> one<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.560> know

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
of these go for the cheaper one I know

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.850 
of these go for the cheaper one I know
there's<00:04:52.070> a<00:04:52.340> modern<00:04:52.910> release<00:04:53.350> that<00:04:54.350> was<00:04:54.680> either

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
there's a modern release that was either

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.920 
there's a modern release that was either
in<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.160> 90s<00:04:55.610> or<00:04:55.789> even<00:04:56.060> more<00:04:56.210> recently<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:56.900> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
in the 90s or even more recently in the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.250 
in the 90s or even more recently in the
2000s<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.600> think<00:04:59.600> two<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.840> these<00:04:59.960> should<00:05:00.229> be

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
2000s I think two of these should be

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.620 
2000s I think two of these should be
good<00:05:00.500> I'll<00:05:00.680> do<00:05:00.860> up<00:05:01.010> one<00:05:01.310> really<00:05:02.030> nice<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.539> then

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
good I'll do up one really nice and then

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.200 
good I'll do up one really nice and then
the<00:05:02.810> other<00:05:02.930> one<00:05:03.169> I'll<00:05:03.350> make<00:05:04.340> for<00:05:04.669> pyro

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
the other one I'll make for pyro

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.170 
the other one I'll make for pyro
purposes<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:05.960> think<00:05:06.430> that's<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> latest<00:05:07.729> kick

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
purposes I think that's the latest kick

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.150 
purposes I think that's the latest kick
I'm<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.539> right<00:05:08.780> now<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.229> I<00:05:09.260> want<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.710> blow<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.889> lot

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
I'm on right now is I want to blow a lot

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.610 
I'm on right now is I want to blow a lot
of<00:05:10.310> models<00:05:10.610> up<00:05:10.820> perhaps<00:05:11.210> this<00:05:11.510> summer<00:05:11.780> so

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
of models up perhaps this summer so

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.409 
of models up perhaps this summer so
having<00:05:12.979> some<00:05:13.310> spares<00:05:13.639> will<00:05:13.880> definitely<00:05:14.300> be

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
having some spares will definitely be

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.440 
having some spares will definitely be
handy<00:05:14.780> for<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:15.910> so<00:05:16.910> I'm<00:05:17.030> thinking<00:05:17.300> that's

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
handy for that so I'm thinking that's

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.930 
handy for that so I'm thinking that's
pretty<00:05:17.630> much<00:05:17.840> it<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.229> think<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.710> slightly<00:05:19.460> bigger

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
pretty much it I think a slightly bigger

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.930 
pretty much it I think a slightly bigger
size<00:05:20.240> for<00:05:20.539> this<00:05:20.630> model<00:05:20.900> would<00:05:21.169> be<00:05:21.200> really<00:05:21.620> good

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
size for this model would be really good

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.060 
size for this model would be really good
cannot<00:05:22.940> obviously<00:05:23.510> see<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.870> just<00:05:24.560> about<00:05:24.770> fits

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
cannot obviously see it just about fits

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.890 
cannot obviously see it just about fits
in<00:05:25.220> my<00:05:25.340> hand<00:05:25.580> but<00:05:25.760> once<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.150> fully<00:05:26.389> built<00:05:26.690> of

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
in my hand but once it's fully built of

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.659 
in my hand but once it's fully built of
course<00:05:27.110> it'll<00:05:27.349> be<00:05:27.470> just<00:05:27.889> a<00:05:28.010> little<00:05:28.160> bit<00:05:28.400> bigger

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
course it'll be just a little bit bigger

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.080 
course it'll be just a little bit bigger
than<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.349> there<00:05:30.979> is<00:05:31.130> no<00:05:31.340> scale<00:05:31.669> given

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
than that so I there is no scale given

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.140 
than that so I there is no scale given
on<00:05:32.240> these<00:05:33.039> looking<00:05:34.039> at<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.280> pilot<00:05:34.729> I<00:05:34.820> guess

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
on these looking at the pilot I guess

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.629 
on these looking at the pilot I guess
he's<00:05:35.389> somewhere<00:05:35.720> around<00:05:35.780> 130<00:05:36.590> 135<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.740> 124

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
he's somewhere around 130 135 so 124

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.250 
he's somewhere around 130 135 so 124
would<00:05:40.849> certainly<00:05:41.150> be<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.389> nice<00:05:41.630> one<00:05:41.930> for<00:05:42.139> this

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
would certainly be a nice one for this

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.960 
would certainly be a nice one for this
one<00:05:43.210> other<00:05:44.210> than<00:05:44.389> that<00:05:44.510> thanks<00:05:45.200> for<00:05:45.349> watching

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
one other than that thanks for watching

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.120 
one other than that thanks for watching
see<00:05:46.970> ya
