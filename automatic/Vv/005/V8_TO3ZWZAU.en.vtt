00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.680

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.050
 heart who heal good in the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.560

 what do you say to me 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810
 As a player 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.010
 the truth I think 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 that question maybe 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.969
 still playing is very difficult 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.530
 answer but why do you think you can 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.520
 look bad I tell you what your 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.510
 clear companions maybe 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.220
 out there asking another person or another 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.860
 person so you can talk about me 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.860
 was to say what I know how to say it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.730
 I try to do my best in the really 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.650
 and in the matches to be able to reach 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.200
 make one the best 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 well we did a tour that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.630
 included many colleagues many countries 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.810
 they put you among the best footballers 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.729
 of the world all your classmates good the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.500
 true that the selection if so 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.450
 obviously obviously good with but I think 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.570
 that most of us all get along very 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.570
 all right 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 all matches 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.310
 and thanks to messi that I vote for you 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.310
 golden ball always always 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.280
 if I always tell him he tells me look at 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.170
 who votes daddy when it's good if I say 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.929
 that did not make us see obviously for me 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.970
 I always read is the best and I think that 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.600
 always every year will be 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.930
 nominated 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.820
 from here I do not know is something that happens 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.410
 something that I do not know, do not feel like 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.720
 play and I'm not nominated but I know what 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.040
 for long it will be nominated for quite 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.659
 quite the remaining years I say and say 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.659
 It is obviously difficult but 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.049
 you said that talking 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.960
 and we chat in another moment 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.550
 I hope it does not end as above 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.710
 happened the worst independent was the one of 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.840
 s 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.640
 it becomes prays veil split the breakdowns 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.030
 to follow is that he will not talk about now 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.030
 dresses 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.540
 very late sometimes nine o'clock at night 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.819
 and when I see life 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.890
 good 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.640
 midmorning and I say to see how it came out 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.640
 as 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.920
 the afternoon and good 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 but if one 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.799
 is pending what happens there 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.660
 no matter 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:42.090
 second third and doing almost the same 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.950
 you can I think so think so 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.269
 obviously many people say no but 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.269
 well you saw I say what 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.880
 does not have bad independent team maybe 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.770
 obviously sometimes not 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.300
 the results you always play against 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.770
 but I think that 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.770
 I know him from Felippe 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 I think he's a good technician and he's the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.770
 technical that has 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.380
 you need I think that brings it forward to 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.380
 although not ascend 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.720
 what is going to be everything possible for who 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.720
 is making these models
