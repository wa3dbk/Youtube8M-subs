00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 O one more tip I will talk a little bit 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.100
 drawback which is a very 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 important 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
 she has some details that I 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.240
 I would like to comment 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.740
 is the first of them to serve 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.139
 actually do not know we can do 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.340
 a lot of who does is the opponent 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.990
 as well I explain 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 who does the strength he's going alone 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.029
 take advantage of the ball speed of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.699
 drawer which means that the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 movement personnel from the return of 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.420
 sake 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 We 're just gonna block Grandma then you. 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 is waiting for the sack of the opponent 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.329
 You're not going to open your arm here to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 behind you do not get out at ball speed 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.170
 second place if you try to do this 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 now it's over because it comes a lot 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.250
 do not know then what are they going to do. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 Come on, prepared to think you 're going. 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 always try to intercept the ball to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.670
 forward entering the ball 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 You're just going to open your arm up here. 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 position of the legs is not very 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 important you will not even have time to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 do this here you can do this 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.869
 way takes the racket so far it 's parallel 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.880
 to review down or up and you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.770
 blocks the ball here in front is just one 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
 lock anything else you are 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 taking advantage of his ball speed and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.049
 he that will make the force then the ball 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.750
 Come on, you touch her. There's a 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.000
 point of contact in front of the body and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.850
 She's going to go back to the court of the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.480
 opponent with a speed 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.520
 taking advantage of the speed of punches 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.870
 an important tip for return of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 serve and this goes for both sides 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.490
 both on the right and on the left 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.270
 short movements in front of the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.920
 body 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.750
 taking advantage of the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.730
 opponent was going to roll a practical course 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.100
 to make mistakes we encourage business in 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.380
 practical course will give a bag and now 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.190
 We are going to try to make this return. 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.660
 that I just explained, let's go then 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.600

 the short stroke and so much ball 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.990

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:21.910
