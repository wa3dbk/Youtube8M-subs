00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:41.969 
at all so yeah and where the hell is the

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:44.479 
at all so yeah and where the hell is the
mission<00:07:42.360> pass<00:07:42.599> Jim<00:07:42.989> now<00:07:43.289> why<00:07:44.069> wasn't<00:07:44.459> that

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:44.489 
mission pass Jim now why wasn't that

00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:49.790 
mission pass Jim now why wasn't that
playing<00:07:45.319> maybe<00:07:46.319> because<00:07:46.739> I<00:07:48.529> turned<00:07:49.529> off<00:07:49.769> the

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 
playing maybe because I turned off the

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.149 
playing maybe because I turned off the
music<00:07:50.129> hopefully<00:07:51.259> that<00:07:52.259> kind<00:07:52.529> of<00:07:52.679> sucks<00:07:52.979> if

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 
music hopefully that kind of sucks if

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:54.889 
music hopefully that kind of sucks if
they<00:07:53.369> don't<00:07:53.579> play<00:07:53.789> the<00:07:53.819> mission<00:07:54.179> pass<00:07:54.569> Jim

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:54.899 
they don't play the mission pass Jim

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.779 
they don't play the mission pass Jim
because<00:07:55.169> I<00:07:55.259> like<00:07:55.469> the<00:07:55.649> mission<00:07:55.949> pass<00:07:56.099> too<00:07:56.429> but

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:56.789 
because I like the mission pass too but

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:58.869 
because I like the mission pass too but
yeah<00:07:57.059> maybe<00:07:57.300> it<00:07:57.479> was<00:07:57.659> just<00:07:57.929> for<00:07:58.199> one<00:07:58.619> time

00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 
yeah maybe it was just for one time

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:03.110 
yeah maybe it was just for one time
