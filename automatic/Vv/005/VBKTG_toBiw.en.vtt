hi<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.790> dr.<00:00:03.150> David<00:00:03.270> Hill<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.659> today<00:00:03.870> we're

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.570 
hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're
going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.319> talk<00:00:04.500> about<00:00:04.620> how<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.950> measure<00:00:05.279> blood

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
going to talk about how to measure blood

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.999 
going to talk about how to measure blood
pressure<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.240> children<00:00:06.780> when<00:00:07.650> we<00:00:07.770> got<00:00:07.920> to

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:08.009 
pressure and children when we got to

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.759 
pressure and children when we got to
measure<00:00:08.130> anybody's<00:00:08.880> blood<00:00:09.090> pressure<00:00:09.390> really

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
measure anybody's blood pressure really

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.049 
measure anybody's blood pressure really
there<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.860> two<00:00:10.980> commonly<00:00:11.370> used<00:00:11.460> techniques

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there are two commonly used techniques

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.110 
there are two commonly used techniques
one<00:00:12.930> that's<00:00:13.500> growing<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.099> more<00:00:14.220> popular

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
one that's growing more and more popular

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.349 
one that's growing more and more popular
is<00:00:15.389> an<00:00:15.840> electronic<00:00:16.619> device<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.820> has<00:00:18.089> an

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
is an electronic device that has an

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
is an electronic device that has an
automatic<00:00:18.779> blood<00:00:19.169> pressure<00:00:19.499> cup<00:00:19.919> the<00:00:20.159> device

automatic blood pressure cup the device

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.329 
automatic blood pressure cup the device
pumps<00:00:20.880> air<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.089> the<00:00:21.630> cuff<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:23.339 
pumps air into the cuff and then a

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.329 
pumps air into the cuff and then a
sensor<00:00:23.909> within<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:24.480> device<00:00:25.050> listens<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.159> the

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
sensor within the device listens for the

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.460 
sensor within the device listens for the
sound<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.999> heartbeats<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.079> vessel

sound of heartbeats in the vessel

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.150 
sound of heartbeats in the vessel

use a stethoscope again you're listening
for<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> sound<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.939> blood<00:01:21.210> flow<00:01:21.509> returning<00:01:22.289> to

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:22.889 
for the sound of blood flow returning to

squeezed off by the air this is an

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:29.539 
squeezed off by the air this is an

pressure<00:01:29.819> is<00:01:29.999> in<00:01:30.119> doubt<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.770> there's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
little bit irregular so if I'm worried

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.949

about a blood pressure and a child for

about a blood pressure and a child for
some<00:01:43.109> reason<00:01:43.409> I'll<00:01:43.499> often<00:01:43.709> recheck<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> myself

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
some reason I'll often recheck it myself

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
some reason I'll often recheck it myself
rather<00:01:45.299> than<00:01:45.569> just<00:01:45.779> trusting<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> Machine

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
rather than just trusting the Machine

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
rather than just trusting the Machine
now<00:01:47.279> there<00:01:47.429> are<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> few<00:01:47.759> important<00:01:48.240> rules

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
now there are a few important rules

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.599 
now there are a few important rules
about<00:01:48.719> taking<00:01:49.109> blood<00:01:49.319> pressure<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:50.039> the

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:50.609 
about taking blood pressure right the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.760 
about taking blood pressure right the
most<00:01:50.969> important<00:01:51.539> is<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> cuff<00:01:52.289> that's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
most important is to get a cuff that's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
most important is to get a cuff that's
the<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.219> size<00:01:53.609> you'll<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.569> on<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.959> blood

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the right size you'll see on all blood

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.779 
the right size you'll see on all blood
pressure<00:01:55.499> cuffs<00:01:55.859> that<00:01:55.979> they're<00:01:56.219> marked<00:01:56.639> with

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
pressure cuffs that they're marked with

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.120 
pressure cuffs that they're marked with
a<00:01:56.819> little<00:01:57.060> white<00:01:57.240> line<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:57.929> when<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.529> fasten

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
a little white line and when you fasten

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
a little white line and when you fasten
them<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.999> side<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.539> cuff<00:02:00.779> ought<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.380> fold

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
them one side of the cuff ought to fold

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.190 
them one side of the cuff ought to fold
within<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.340> zone<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.450> marked<00:02:03.929> by<00:02:04.139> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
within the zone that's marked by the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.559 
within the zone that's marked by the
white<00:02:04.469> line<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.099> cuff<00:02:05.609> that's<00:02:05.789> too<00:02:06.029> large<00:02:06.389> for

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
white line a cuff that's too large for

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.240 
white line a cuff that's too large for
an<00:02:06.869> arm<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.529> give<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.709> reading<00:02:08.009> that's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
an arm will give a reading that's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.940 
an arm will give a reading that's
artificially<00:02:09.060> low<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.750> cuff<00:02:10.290> that's<00:02:10.500> too<00:02:10.680> small

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
artificially low a cuff that's too small

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.740 
artificially low a cuff that's too small
for<00:02:11.370> an<00:02:11.490> arm<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.910> guessed<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.570> will<00:02:12.990> read<00:02:13.200> too

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
for an arm you guessed it will read too

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.660 
for an arm you guessed it will read too
I<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.680> sure<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.980> cuff<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.490> right

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
I see I'm sure the cuff is the right

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.090 
I see I'm sure the cuff is the right
size<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.660> other<00:02:16.690> thing<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.290> want<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.890> make
