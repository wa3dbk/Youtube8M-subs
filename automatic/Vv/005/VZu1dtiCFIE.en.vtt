00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
quite early lead and then my opponent

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.119 
quite early lead and then my opponent
decides<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.389> rage<00:03:30.690> quit<00:03:31.049> which<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.889> really

stupid<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.669> think<00:03:33.299> because<00:03:33.479> yet<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:34.530> 18

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
stupid I think because yet like 18

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.439 
stupid I think because yet like 18
minutes<00:03:35.400> left<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.729> get<00:03:35.849> back<00:03:36.000> into<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.299> game

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
and then the side to rage quit isn't

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
and then the side to rage quit isn't
really<00:03:39.000> smart<00:03:39.299> at<00:03:39.449> all<00:03:39.569> but<00:03:39.780> yeah<00:03:39.900> we<00:03:40.049> moved<00:03:40.290> on

but unfortunately it does a chip and he
makes<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.889> 10<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:02.430> we<00:04:02.579> are<00:04:02.729> away<00:04:03.060> with

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
makes it 10 and then we are away with

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.149

jopson<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> ball<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.290> then<00:04:04.470> he<00:04:04.739> decided

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
jopson on the ball and then he decided

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
to slice economy with young fertile and

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.500 
to slice economy with young fertile and
any<00:04:07.500> picks<00:04:07.769> up<00:04:07.919> a<00:04:08.010> red<00:04:08.159> card<00:04:08.430> then<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.209> pick<00:04:09.359> up

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
any picks up a red card then we pick up

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.300 
any picks up a red card then we pick up
a<00:04:09.599> free<00:04:09.810> kick<00:04:09.989> at<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.169> edge<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.859> box<00:04:11.009> and<00:04:11.189> I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
a free kick at the edge of the box and I

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
a free kick at the edge of the box and I
first<00:04:11.609> thought<00:04:11.819> maybe<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.359> could<00:04:12.479> have<00:04:12.599> been<00:04:12.720> a

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
first thought maybe it could have been a

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020 
first thought maybe it could have been a
penalty<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:13.409> me<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:14.099> in<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.669> end<00:04:14.759> he<00:04:14.849> was

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
penalty for me but in the end he was

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.849 
penalty for me but in the end he was
just<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.359> free<00:04:15.569> kick<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.380> wasn't<00:04:16.650> really<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
just a free kick and it wasn't really a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.740 
just a free kick and it wasn't really a
good<00:04:17.039> one<00:04:17.250> then<00:04:17.699> we<00:04:17.820> have<00:04:17.880> ronaldinho<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.599> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
good one then we have ronaldinho on the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.479 
good one then we have ronaldinho on the
ball<00:04:18.900> does<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.139> nice<00:04:19.409> elastico<00:04:20.039> pass<00:04:20.280> the

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
ball does a nice elastico pass the

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
ball does a nice elastico pass the
player<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.909> does<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.509> slide<00:04:21.810> tackle<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.380> will
