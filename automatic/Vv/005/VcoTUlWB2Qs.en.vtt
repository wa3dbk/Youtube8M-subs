that doesn't need to blink a lot because

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
that doesn't need to blink a lot because
my<00:00:41.010> eyes<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.820> lubricated<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
my eyes are really lubricated and I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.450 
my eyes are really lubricated and I
didn't<00:00:42.960> learn<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.320> until<00:00:43.770> i<00:00:44.010> started<00:00:44.309> doing

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
didn't learn this until i started doing

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.610 
didn't learn this until i started doing
something<00:00:45.000> where<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> talking<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> camera

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
something where I talking to a camera

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
something where I talking to a camera
and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> internet<00:00:48.780> for

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and then put it on the internet for

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.410 
and then put it on the internet for
millions<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> people<00:00:49.590> look<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.360> don't<00:00:51.360> know

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
millions of people look at I don't know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.850 
millions of people look at I don't know
if<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> flaw<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> good

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
if that's a flaw I think it's a good

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
if that's a flaw I think it's a good
thing<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.910> we're<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> desert

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
thing because if we're in the desert

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
thing because if we're in the desert
some<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.500> guys<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.890> fucking<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.399> blind

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
some of you guys would fucking go blind

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
some of you guys would fucking go blind
because<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> blink<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.840> you'll

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
because you need to blink so much you'll

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
because you need to blink so much you'll
use<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:59.239> fucking<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
use up all your fucking water in your

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.329 
use up all your fucking water in your
body<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:01.890> you'll<00:01:02.100> die<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> dehydration

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
body and then you'll die of dehydration

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.500 
body and then you'll die of dehydration
