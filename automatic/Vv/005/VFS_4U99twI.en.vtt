 well we are located in the villa 31 where 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 women also put passion to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.970
 football 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.240
 [Music] 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.470
 [Music] 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.570
 in our society football is 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.270
 installed as the sport of everything and in 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.070
 the retirement neighborhood the villa 31 is not the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.140
 exception 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.880
 when the sun falls on one of the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.160
 oldest settlements in the capital 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.430
 federal the canchita of the neighborhood gÃ¼emes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 change your geography because it 's time 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.989
 of the males move away from the folder 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.390
 green so that a group of women 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.510
 can enjoy the sport that most 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.170
 far 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.980
 [Music] 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.719
 There is a great passion for a sport 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.969
 that I think is central to the life of 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.000
 the Argentines that constitutes a lot of 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.830
 national identity and that we do not 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.380
 we are outside of that we are not 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.850
 simply viewers we want to play 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.580
 a game that we are passionate about that we want 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.619
 be protagonists of the game and in that is 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.509
 that we have a fight of a time 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.549
 long and that here in the neighborhood has 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.220
 taken to conquer a space and a 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.830
 schedule for women not exclusively 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.619
 for women with everything that implies 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.990
 and make visible visible that desire 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.530
 and that love for the game that we 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 we also feel 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910
 Y 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.409
 the program goals and goals are not only 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.049
 summarizes the ball but helps more than 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.119
 40 women who make it up to generate a 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.469
 participation space of obtaining 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.630
 of tools for development 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.270
 staff we make their groups the games 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 some talks and there yes that we 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.869
 we have a problem we talk to each other 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.429
 give solutions between us 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.180
 pure women and among us 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.510
 we support 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.450
 the case that is and we re all supported 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.630
 together we are always united first of all 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.150
 and so we come to play football together without 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.680
 lawsuits without fights and nothing if there is no 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.580
 Sometimes I come to play podium I love myself 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.920
 have fun when I have a fight I go to another 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.820
 I scream but football helps me 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.040
 come give me laughter 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.590
 [Music] 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.569
 for many things and then it 's a while 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.489
 game is not play we like everyone and 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.980
 it seems that women this we have it 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.079
 a little denied that leisure or pleasure 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.910
 for the game is not given to us, not what 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.819
 we have 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.609
 [Music] 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.069
 they also see in soccer the 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.079
 possibility to get ahead and to 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.540
 time to look for an identification 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.519
 the comparison is almost a year long 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.990
 has to see its origins and the desire 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.800
 to transform your reality 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:00.620
 I do not have any but I see it 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.620
 as well as you left the villa what do I know 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.220
 because it costs and seeing it like that and seeing the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.660
 tele that went down there came out of the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.660
 villa that with the help of parents 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.560
 wow 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.430
 termination 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.560
 triminium and discriminated in some cases 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
 discrimination and indifference are 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.630
 make sense by entering a world that 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:35.650
 it is only supposed to be reserved for 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:37.120
 men and that there are mandates and issues 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.560
 that work in the culture that are not 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.849
 written in no place that does not 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.700
 they need to be written because they simply 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.840
 are not put and for centuries in 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.890
 think that women there are no sports or 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.069
 situations that we can not meet or 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.260
 go through because it is considered that 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.480
 physically they are very inferior because they do not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.190
 we know how to play as well as boys and 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.380
 The truth is that historically we 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.569
 has denied that possibility and when it was 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.250
 little girl like that because I did the macho na 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.470
 lots of things but now nothing 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.630
 because I start thinking and they ask me 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.959
 jua know what to do because by doing some 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.700
 sport if soccer swimming and when I say 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.500
 soccer guanjuato the ball how many 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.819
 little games you do and good of how to play 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.820
 with my classmates all 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.500
 but before I quote Cecilio but not here 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.970
 In Argentina there is a lot of machismo 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.940
 that women go to wash 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.380
 dishes to cook but if you see it right or 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.699
 whether the side is the good side 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.759
 positive there are males who play at 6 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.500
 to the voley there are males who cook 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.480
 they clean 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.340
 and even things that there are girls that do not 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.680
 do not even the males and for six 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.810
 years the girls of the villa 31 play at 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.480
 soccer here in the canchita in the middle 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.730
 from the neighborhood they have their dreams and 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.970
 everyone revolves around the ball play 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.090
 professionally soccer 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:58.780
 professionally and reach achieve not 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.460
 I know how to explain it come to light my 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.370
 game 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.190
 that everyone knows my game and that 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.070
 is where you would like to play 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.370
 well it would be here or in another country wherever 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.040
 give me the opportunity 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.540
 and take advantage of it with the future I would like 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.090
 be a footballer and reach more if we 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:23.930
 another other dream singer finish the 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.910
 school and finish school and good 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.410
 work in white have a good salary 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:44.230
 and the hours stop me from getting ahead 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:44.230
