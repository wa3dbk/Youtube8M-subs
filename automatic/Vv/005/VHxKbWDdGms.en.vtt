00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
number 12 so instead of reloading I just

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.160 
number 12 so instead of reloading I just
turned<00:02:44.820> around<00:02:44.970> looked<00:02:45.510> at<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.780> composition

then wound off and put another roll of
film<00:02:50.850> in<00:02:51.090> never<00:02:51.630> thought<00:02:51.840> much<00:02:52.020> more<00:02:52.260> about<00:02:52.500> it

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
film in never thought much more about it

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.490 
film in never thought much more about it
until<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:54.270> saw<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.540> process<00:02:55.020> when<00:02:55.200> they<00:02:55.320> came

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500

happened to me about seven or eight
years<00:03:25.110> ago<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.090> it<00:03:27.090> was<00:03:27.210> it<00:03:27.510> was<00:03:27.630> huge<00:03:27.960> because

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
years ago and it was it was huge because

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.610 
years ago and it was it was huge because
being<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.950> very<00:03:29.520> non-technical<00:03:29.940> person<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
being a very non-technical person and I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.550 
being a very non-technical person and I
found<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.190> very<00:03:32.340> difficult<00:03:32.540> but<00:03:33.540> when<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
found it very difficult but when the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.650 
found it very difficult but when the
nikon<00:03:35.040> d3<00:03:35.430> came<00:03:35.670> along<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.060> i<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.240> introduced

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
nikon d3 came along and i was introduced

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.870 
nikon d3 came along and i was introduced
to that<00:03:36.810> particular<00:03:37.110> camera<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.490> an

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
to that particular camera it's an

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.850 
to that particular camera it's an
enabled<00:03:39.420> me<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.570> be<00:03:39.900> able<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.110> shoot<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:40.530> and

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
enabled me to be able to shoot it's and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.190 
enabled me to be able to shoot it's and
beautiful<00:03:41.310> low<00:03:41.460> light<00:03:41.700> levels<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.300> dump<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
beautiful low light levels and dump that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.250 
beautiful low light levels and dump that
helped<00:03:43.560> me<00:03:43.710> overcome<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.430> challenge<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.260> but

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
helped me overcome the challenge and but

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.300 
helped me overcome the challenge and but
let's<00:03:46.410> say<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.680> was<00:03:46.800> definitely<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
let's say that was definitely the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.540 
let's say that was definitely the
biggest<00:03:47.460> one<00:03:51.890> would<00:03:52.890> have<00:03:52.980> been<00:03:53.130> from<00:03:53.459> an

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
biggest one would have been from an

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.010 
biggest one would have been from an
american<00:03:53.940> photographer<00:03:54.120> by<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.690> name<00:03:54.840> of

world doesn't compensate for the ability
to<00:04:04.110> see<00:04:04.410> what<00:04:05.340> he<00:04:05.430> meant<00:04:05.610> by<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:06.350> instead

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
to see what he meant by that was instead

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.110 
to see what he meant by that was instead
of<00:04:07.530> getting<00:04:08.190> technical<00:04:08.400> with<00:04:08.730> your<00:04:08.850> camera

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
of getting technical with your camera

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.940 
of getting technical with your camera
and<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.510> lenses<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.290> forth<00:04:10.650> and

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
and the lenses and so forth and

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.250 
and the lenses and so forth and
everything<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.700> goes<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:13.080> look

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
everything that goes with it is to look

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.960 
everything that goes with it is to look
for<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.560> pictures<00:04:13.980> look<00:04:14.520> for<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> moment

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
for the pictures look for the moment

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.390 
for the pictures look for the moment
that's<00:04:15.300> more<00:04:15.630> important<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.890> can<00:04:17.100> have<00:04:17.370> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
that's more important and you can have a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.909 
that's more important and you can have a
lens<00:04:17.730> on<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.959> might<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.320> something<00:04:19.590> you

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
lens on and you might see something you

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.199 
lens on and you might see something you
think<00:04:20.130> well<00:04:20.310> maybe<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.609> should<00:04:20.790> change<00:04:20.940> lenses

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
think well maybe I should change lenses

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.120 
think well maybe I should change lenses
and<00:04:21.570> about<00:04:22.049> time<00:04:22.230> you<00:04:22.380> change<00:04:22.620> lenses<00:04:22.830> you've

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
and about time you change lenses you've

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.550 
and about time you change lenses you've
missed<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> moment<00:04:23.790> so<00:04:24.450> it's<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.110> capturing

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
missed the moment so it's just capturing

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.130 
missed the moment so it's just capturing
that<00:04:25.770> moment<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.660> looking<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> image

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
that moment and looking for the image

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.200 
that moment and looking for the image
instead<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.650> getting<00:04:28.890> involved<00:04:29.370> with<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
instead of getting involved with the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.530 
instead of getting involved with the
technicalities

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.519 

there

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:40.529 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.159 

well<00:04:41.459> I'm<00:04:41.579> holding<00:04:41.909> up<00:04:41.999> the<00:04:42.119> D<00:04:42.239> for<00:04:42.479> now<00:04:42.659> but<00:04:42.929> I

look<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.280> guess<00:05:35.490> as<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:35.790> landscape<00:05:36.240> photography

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
look I guess as a landscape photography

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.900 
look I guess as a landscape photography
you<00:05:36.840> do<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.470> have<00:05:37.500> patience<00:05:38.130> when<00:05:38.790> you

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
you do have to have patience when you

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.730 
you do have to have patience when you
when<00:05:39.210> you<00:05:39.240> see<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.540> great<00:05:39.810> landscaping<00:05:40.350> you

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
when you see a great landscaping you

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.580 
when you see a great landscaping you
think<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.760> just<00:05:41.970> needs<00:05:42.210> something<00:05:42.480> more<00:05:42.630> than

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
think it just needs something more than

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.560 
think it just needs something more than
what's<00:05:43.860> there<00:05:43.980> then<00:05:44.880> it's<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.120> case<00:05:45.300> for

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
what's there then it's a case for

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.540 
what's there then it's a case for
waiting<00:05:45.870> for<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.080> right<00:05:46.230> weather<00:05:46.550> conditions

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
waiting for the right weather conditions

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.460 
waiting for the right weather conditions

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
the light coming through array of them

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.070 
the light coming through array of them
coming<00:05:50.310> through<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.580> section<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.480> cloud<00:05:51.750> and

coming through a section of cloud and

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.750 
coming through a section of cloud and

which adds to those elements shooting at

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.190 
which adds to those elements shooting at
the<00:05:56.820> right<00:05:56.940> time<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.330> day<00:05:57.510> early<00:05:58.050> in<00:05:58.110> the

perspective<00:06:10.800> i<00:06:11.430> think<00:06:11.460> is<00:06:11.730> really<00:06:12.030> important

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
perspective i think is really important

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.110 
perspective i think is really important
and<00:06:12.950> otherwise<00:06:13.950> you've<00:06:14.340> got<00:06:14.490> no<00:06:14.700> way<00:06:15.090> of

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
and otherwise you've got no way of

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.600 
and otherwise you've got no way of
knowing<00:06:15.270> how<00:06:15.870> big<00:06:16.380> this<00:06:16.590> landscape<00:06:17.100> really<00:06:17.520> is

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
knowing how big this landscape really is

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.470 
knowing how big this landscape really is
so<00:06:18.420> that<00:06:18.630> would<00:06:18.960> be<00:06:18.990> my<00:06:19.200> tip<00:06:19.800> is<00:06:19.920> to<00:06:19.980> look<00:06:20.220> for

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
so that would be my tip is to look for

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.570 
so that would be my tip is to look for
elements<00:06:21.480> within<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:22.160> subject<00:06:23.160> matter<00:06:23.340> and

elements within the subject matter and

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.840 
elements within the subject matter and
then<00:06:24.480> wait<00:06:24.660> for<00:06:24.690> the<00:06:24.870> great<00:06:25.050> line<00:06:25.640> I'd<00:06:26.640> like<00:06:26.820> to
