00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:15.370
 This course is how to draw course of the bike by here sigma of 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.660
 Voice actor Kuze Yuki is in charge 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:24.289
 step 1 bike parts 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:31.030
 First, let's see what kind of parts are in the cabinet in the bike 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:37.240
 There are also parts that are left and right depending on the function that has only this part even if you look only at the surface 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:42.180
 Other drive chains that require rotation of the side stand and wheels required for stopping 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:46.410
 Such bikes were made by many parts 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:51.820
 You can not write unless you understand all of them 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.610
 Let's write consciously the part that looks like a bike when you are out 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 step 2 types of bike 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.470
 Although the following is Ikuno kind here is to choose the one close to the image you want to write their own 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.530
 Let's go 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 I can not refer to the image of each bike here, so I know what kind of bike it is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.780
 And 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.590
 Please use it when searching for images 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.940
 For example , if you want to make a move and make an action 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:26.820
 It will be good per super sports off-road truck 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:34.190
 If you want to express the cuteness is lovely in the body street is small 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.190
 There are tourers and big scooters when you want to write a large car body 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 step Good parts to be aware of at 3 nights 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.280
 Explain that there are more parts and types of motorcycles than illustrated for Step 1 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.409
 It has decided 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 Some people would Mei' in the abundance of the 9 dishes when I thought to try to write a bike 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.670
 maybe 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:06.140
 So in this course I tried to think about good parts to be aware of when writing a bike 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.470
 I think most of what you see is a part that anyone saw 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.790
 When it changed consciously suppress these parts 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:19.099
 I can write to go 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.099
 The part called fork is for the purpose of relieving the shock coming from the wheel 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.910
 Number of bikes 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.000
 Let's think about what kind of composition you would like to have an image of the bike you want to write 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.730
 Let's go 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.340
 The easiest is a side view 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.910
 In this case , it would be good to take care of the character's behavior and situations etc. 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 Most of the big moving parts of the bike are the direction to the left and right of Zenrin 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 If you can use this part well, you will have a three-dimensional effect at once 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:02.830
 Let's make only this front part different angle from others if + depth and movement in the car body 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.160
 The very easy way to write the front part in front 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.240
 After that there is a thing to put out the depth 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.720
 While appealing to the front that is an impressive part of the bike 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:19.300
 You can create a three-dimensional effect with the character 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:23.250
 I will twist my body a bit when I carry the character, so I can get a rough bike 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.290
 Let's be careful when making it 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.790
 Put your character on the bike 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:37.609
 Let's put on the character next when the bike is finished 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.690
 There is a case that here does not fit is very difficult hard to the body and the bike of the angle of character 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.440
 I will 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.860
 Where you want to be aware of when putting a character on the pedal 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.190
 Or from the part where you put your foot 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:56.760
 It is the place where it is connected with the seat puri lip pattern 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:04:00.020
 In most cases, the approach is forward- looking and the more compact and speedy you are 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.020
 Can be 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.000
 Beppu 6 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.150
 Postwar production from illustration production rough 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.870
 Then actually the body pose 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.049
 Let's write up to put the character 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:22.780
 At first we will close the rough angle of the character and the bike 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.820
 I will write the tires and then I will write the characters 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:33.310
 The image may be limited after all the bikes have been written 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:38.560
 Let's continue to shape how expected or as an integral character and bike 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.150
 Character costumes and accessories to make your bike fit your character while picking up a bike 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.720
 Let's think about 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:54.050
 It is the first costume This Ishoru is also that it's dangerous when it is traveling in the bike leg Ya 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:56.340
 Some people have a good atmosphere when writing even with their arms exposed, so think deeply 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 It doesn't have to be 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:05.390
 I also true with respect to the structure of the bike at the earlier of the next section but essence a realistic depiction 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:11.350
 Will be at your own discretion 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:16.270
 I think that there are times when the impression of the character and the body may not match in childcare 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:20.169
 At that time, I would like to be close to my image without making major changes 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.729
 It is good to change from the front part 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:31.539
 Adjust the height of the seat and the length of the car if necessary 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:37.390
 When changing the height of the seat, you should not change the posture of the character properly. 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:42.710
 Be careful as you will have to adjust the entire bike over and over again 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:46.750
 If rough is done to some extent, let's write in costumes and accessories of the character 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:52.810
 It is legs and arms that struggle hard at this time 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:55.630
 If the foot is firmly on the step or pedal part, the front of the case should be facing you 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.070
 Do not try to force your legs out 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.070
 Let's put it in a bent state 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.990
 Illustration production color 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.120
 While this time the bike has a Etro form 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:17.270
 I wanted to use the design of the character 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:22.820
 The coloring of the bike is originally not very colorful but it is very free to write 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:26.280
 You can decide the color, so think about your favorite color 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:32.639
 It becomes a lecture course on how to draw a motorcycle 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:37.180
 It may be thought that it will take time to write complicated and detailed when it comes to bikes 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:41.289
 I think that you can write with ideas much more freely than gift-giving 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:45.659
 I hope that this course is helpful for someone 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.659
 Thank you for watching
