screen<00:00:56.559> saying<00:00:56.829> too<00:00:57.250> far<00:00:57.460> you<00:00:57.610> can<00:00:57.760> actually

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
screen saying too far you can actually

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.369 
screen saying too far you can actually
hang<00:00:58.180> as<00:00:58.390> well<00:00:58.629> as<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.930> can<00:00:59.020> see<00:00:59.079> right<00:00:59.260> here

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
hang as well as you can see right here

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.080 
hang as well as you can see right here
usually<00:00:59.770> hang<00:01:00.160> that<00:01:00.309> like<00:01:00.460> spider-man<00:01:00.940> and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
usually hang that like spider-man and

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.119 
usually hang that like spider-man and
just<00:01:01.449> like<00:01:01.600> hang<00:01:01.809> off<00:01:01.930> ceilings<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.920> only

just like hang off ceilings and it only
lasts<00:01:03.399> I<00:01:03.520> think<00:01:03.760> for<00:01:03.910> about<00:01:04.059> three<00:01:04.330> or<00:01:04.360> four

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
lasts I think for about three or four

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.540 
lasts I think for about three or four
seconds<00:01:05.050> and<00:01:05.140> then<00:01:05.800> all<00:01:05.890> like<00:01:06.070> drop<00:01:06.310> you<00:01:06.460> off

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
seconds and then all like drop you off

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.880 
seconds and then all like drop you off

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you use it very very tactically I can

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.050 
you use it very very tactically I can
see<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.680> gameplay<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:54.220> make<00:02:54.670> connecting<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
see in this gameplay I make connecting a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.550 
see in this gameplay I make connecting a
lot<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.270> tags<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.690> finish<00:02:55.930> by<00:02:56.050> wrapping<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
lot of tags and finish by wrapping so I

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.750

and then why you see the midair

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.570 
and then why you see the midair
traveling<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.770> quickly<00:03:29.980> grapple<00:03:30.459> to

and<00:03:37.030> also<00:03:37.330> pretty<00:03:37.630> my<00:03:37.780> most<00:03:38.080> fun<00:03:38.200> way<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.410> use

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
and also pretty my most fun way to use

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.350 
and also pretty my most fun way to use
it<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.890> just<00:03:39.340> grappling<00:03:39.700> people<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> kill<00:03:40.269> it

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
it is just grappling people to kill it

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.820 
it is just grappling people to kill it
that's<00:03:40.420> actually<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:40.959> effective<00:03:41.380> it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
that's actually really effective it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.140 
that's actually really effective it
might<00:03:41.980> look<00:03:42.220> kind<00:03:42.280> of<00:03:42.519> overpowered<00:03:42.940> by<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
might look kind of overpowered by the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.520 
might look kind of overpowered by the
gamepad<00:03:43.630> show<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.050> course<00:03:44.170> these<00:03:44.350> are

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
gamepad show you of course these are

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.810 
gamepad show you of course these are
highlights<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> lot<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.190> times<00:03:45.370> are<00:03:45.459> using<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
highlights a lot of times are using it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.220 
highlights a lot of times are using it
and<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.269> was<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.420> failing<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:46.959> getting

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
and I was just failing and getting

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.600 
and I was just failing and getting
killed<00:03:47.500> so<00:03:47.560> these<00:03:47.769> are<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> highlights<00:03:48.370> bear

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
killed so these are the highlights bear

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.860 
killed so these are the highlights bear
in<00:03:48.700> mind<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.060> wouldn't<00:03:49.450> say<00:03:49.570> it's<00:03:49.720> too

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
in mind I wouldn't say it's too

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.180 
in mind I wouldn't say it's too
overpowered<00:03:50.350> just<00:03:50.470> from<00:03:50.590> my<00:03:50.739> impressions

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
overpowered just from my impressions

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.650 
overpowered just from my impressions
it's<00:03:51.340> common<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.880> EV<00:03:52.090> throwing<00:03:52.540> knife

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660
