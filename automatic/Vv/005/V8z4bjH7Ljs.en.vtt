it's<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.760> softer<00:03:00.760> meat<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:02.069> how<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.250> gives

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
it's a softer meat it's a how it gives

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.360 
it's a softer meat it's a how it gives
eat<00:03:03.640> almost<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.590> yeah<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.800> can't<00:03:06.010> cook<00:03:06.220> it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
eat almost and I yeah you can't cook it

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.070 
eat almost and I yeah you can't cook it
too<00:03:06.520> fast<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.090> have<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.300> like<00:03:07.420> slowly<00:03:07.780> bring

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
too fast you have to like slowly bring

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.199 
too fast you have to like slowly bring
temperatures<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.190> meat<00:03:09.370> doesn't<00:03:09.520> fall

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
temperatures up so the meat doesn't fall

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.150 
temperatures up so the meat doesn't fall
apart<00:03:10.569> or<00:03:11.020> things<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.410> doesn't<00:03:11.830> weigh<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.040> down

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
apart or things it doesn't weigh it down

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.520 
apart or things it doesn't weigh it down
or<00:03:12.670> bubble<00:03:13.030> from<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.330> inside<00:03:13.720> or<00:03:13.750> things<00:03:14.410> like

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
or bubble from the inside or things like

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.729 
or bubble from the inside or things like
that<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:15.190> put<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.120> those<00:03:16.269> trees<00:03:16.569> steps<00:03:17.200> or<00:03:17.560> in

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that I put it on those trees steps or in

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.940 
that I put it on those trees steps or in
a<00:03:17.890> shortcut<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.760> see<00:03:19.050> dry<00:03:20.050> it<00:03:20.110> smoke<00:03:20.739> it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
a shortcut you can see dry it smoke it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.180 
a shortcut you can see dry it smoke it
cook<00:03:21.250> them<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.700> that's<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.810> these<00:03:23.680> are<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
cook them and that's it these are the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.559 
cook them and that's it these are the
fruits<00:03:25.410> these<00:03:26.410> are<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.800> folks<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:28.209> tell<00:03:28.420> you

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
fruits these are the folks to tell you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.479 
fruits these are the folks to tell you
the<00:03:28.720> temperature<00:03:28.989> inside<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.040> fish<00:03:30.250> they

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
the temperature inside the fish they

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.840 
the temperature inside the fish they
make<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:31.060> tell<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.420> how<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.470> cooking<00:03:32.950> and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
make to tell you how it's cooking and

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.890 
make to tell you how it's cooking and
then<00:03:34.120> it's<00:03:34.299> cooked<00:03:34.600> through<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.170> process

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
then it's cooked through the process

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.590 
then it's cooked through the process
with<00:03:37.900> these<00:03:38.110> type<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.590> fish<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.180> dry

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
with these type of fish you have to dry

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.370 
with these type of fish you have to dry
it<00:03:40.660> for<00:03:41.019> us<00:03:41.200> get<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.590> dry<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:43.060> not<00:03:43.269> too<00:03:43.540> dry<00:03:43.870> you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
it for us get it dry but not too dry you

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.699 
it for us get it dry but not too dry you
have<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.220> know<00:03:45.430> get<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.599> feel<00:03:46.840> of<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.560> you

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
have to know get the feel of it that you

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.460 
have to know get the feel of it that you
don't<00:03:47.860> dry<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.190> too<00:03:48.489> much<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:49.000> then<00:03:49.720> it's<00:03:49.930> when

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
don't dry it too much and then it's when

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.729 
don't dry it too much and then it's when
it's<00:03:50.650> properly<00:03:51.130> dried<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:52.630> smoke<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.470> had

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
it's properly dried you smoke it you had

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.330 
it's properly dried you smoke it you had
smoked<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.580> give<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.940> nice<00:03:55.120> color<00:03:55.630> and

smoked it to give it a nice color and
after<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.430> feel<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:58.000> you've<00:03:58.180> given<00:03:58.390> it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
after you feel that you've given it

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.289 
after you feel that you've given it
enough<00:03:58.900> smoke<00:03:59.500> to<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> good<00:04:00.700> color<00:04:01.030> then

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
enough smoke to have a good color then

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.840 
enough smoke to have a good color then
you<00:04:01.420> have<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.720> cook<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.140> but<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.340> take

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
you have to cook it but you have to take

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.650 
you have to cook it but you have to take
care<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.440> drying<00:04:05.799> process<00:04:05.920> which<00:04:06.700> is<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.180> me

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
part in the process to get a fish rated

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.409 
part in the process to get a fish rated
it<00:04:16.090> has<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.449> be<00:04:16.570> dried<00:04:16.810> properly<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.269> to

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
it has to be dried properly you have to

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.240 
it has to be dried properly you have to
drive<00:04:19.660> in<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.900> baby<00:04:20.169> there's<00:04:20.590> still<00:04:20.949> some

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
drive in a baby there's still some

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.600 
drive in a baby there's still some
moisture<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:23.680> smoke<00:04:23.979> can

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
moisture and it so that is smoke can

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.560 
moisture and it so that is smoke can
adhere<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.360> skin<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:26.080> got<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:27.160> for<00:04:27.570> right

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
adhere to the skin I got that for right

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.890 
adhere to the skin I got that for right
now

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
now

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.640 
now
at<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.440> moment<00:04:29.650> it's<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.310> 71<00:04:31.150> degrees<00:04:31.570> in<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
at the moment it's a 71 degrees in the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.230 
at the moment it's a 71 degrees in the
fish<00:04:33.030> internal<00:04:34.030> pool<00:04:34.300> this<00:04:35.259> is<00:04:35.410> gotta<00:04:35.590> cook

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
fish internal pool this is gotta cook

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.350 
fish internal pool this is gotta cook
until<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.360> reach<00:04:37.949> 145<00:04:38.949> degrees<00:04:39.370> then<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
until you reach 145 degrees then the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.400 
until you reach 145 degrees then the
fish<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.750> cooked

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
fish is cooked

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.469 
fish is cooked
if<00:04:42.099> you<00:04:42.340> go<00:04:42.550> over<00:04:42.750> 145<00:04:43.750> if<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.710> over<00:04:45.009> Pope<00:04:45.479> it

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
if you go over 145 if it is over Pope it

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.939 
if you go over 145 if it is over Pope it
will<00:04:46.750> go<00:04:46.900> below<00:04:47.400> 140<00:04:48.400> 145<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.349> fish<00:04:50.560> will<00:04:50.800> be

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
will go below 140 145 the fish will be

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.570 
will go below 140 145 the fish will be
wrong<00:04:51.900> yeah<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.349> most<00:04:53.590> nerve-wracking<00:04:54.250> point

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
wrong yeah the most nerve-wracking point

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.850 
wrong yeah the most nerve-wracking point
of<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> whole<00:04:55.060> thing<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.449> just<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.590> put<00:04:56.740> the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
of the whole thing is just you put the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.189 
of the whole thing is just you put the
fish<00:04:57.039> in<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.310> you<00:04:57.580> dry<00:04:57.849> it<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.720> then<00:04:58.870> when<00:04:59.110> you

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
fish in and you dry it and then when you

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.990 
fish in and you dry it and then when you
think<00:04:59.380> it's<00:04:59.590> at<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.070> right<00:05:00.250> point<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.729> dryness

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
think it's at the right point of dryness

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.450 
think it's at the right point of dryness
then<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.960> put<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.289> in<00:05:02.470> then<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.070> have<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.340> be

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
then you put it in then you have to be

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.770 
then you put it in then you have to be
like<00:05:03.580> putting<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.300> smoke<00:05:04.570> and<00:05:04.690> then
