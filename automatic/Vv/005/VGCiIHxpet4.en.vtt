00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
shot was actually kind of difficult for

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.810 
shot was actually kind of difficult for
me<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.070> wanted<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
me because I wanted them to move a
specific<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.500> took<00:01:04.589> me<00:01:04.739> 80<00:01:04.920> million

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
specific way and it took me 80 million

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.800 
specific way and it took me 80 million
time<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.790> right<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.600> finally

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
time to get it right but then I finally

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.280 
time to get it right but then I finally
got<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.760> anyway<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> first

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
written mostly not on the game because I

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910 
written mostly not on the game because I
wanted<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.840> introduce<00:01:13.049> knuckles<00:01:13.619> who<00:01:13.830> you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
lot of shots with knuckle sonic and
tails<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.860> shot<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.340> went<00:01:41.700> into<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
tails on the same shot I went into the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.190 
tails on the same shot I went into the
game<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> figured<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.960> really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
game and I figured out that I really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.109 
game and I figured out that I really
couldn't<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.340> thanks<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> video

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
couldn't do it but then thanks to video

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
I'd like the solo references like this

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.149 
I'd like the solo references like this
that<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.599> show<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.829> trailer

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
that it's a show like the trailer

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.309 
that it's a show like the trailer
reference<00:02:27.519> because<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:28.720> just<00:02:28.870> plain<00:02:28.989> funny

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
reference because it's just plain funny

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.479 
reference because it's just plain funny
a<00:02:31.349> few<00:02:32.349> seconds<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.069> Sonic<00:02:33.370> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
a few seconds here you see Sonic and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.679 
a few seconds here you see Sonic and
tells<00:02:33.640> run<00:02:33.790> off<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.060> screen<00:02:34.390> which<00:02:34.569> is

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
tells run off the screen which is

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.729 
tells run off the screen which is
something<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.019> I've<00:02:35.230> been<00:02:35.319> wanting<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.590> do

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
something that I've been wanting to do

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.099 
something that I've been wanting to do
for<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.950> while<00:02:36.129> now<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:37.420> eventually<00:02:37.689> figured

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
for a while now and I eventually figured

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.679 
for a while now and I eventually figured
out<00:02:38.200> how<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.409> do<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.819> because<00:02:39.819> with<00:02:40.090> debug<00:02:40.450> mode

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
out how to do it because with debug mode

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.559 
out how to do it because with debug mode
I<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:40.989> record<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.439> background<00:02:41.950> shot<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:43.540> is

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
I can record a background shot which is

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.619 
I can record a background shot which is
really<00:02:44.470> useful<00:02:44.889> because<00:02:45.209> what<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.239> do<00:02:46.329> is<00:02:46.540> I

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
really useful because what I do is I

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.300 
really useful because what I do is I
just<00:02:46.659> have<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.019> character<00:02:47.349> look<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.040> then

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
just have the character look up and then

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.710 
just have the character look up and then
the<00:02:48.430> camera<00:02:48.760> moves<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.180> when<00:02:49.269> I<00:02:49.359> switch<00:02:49.540> to

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the camera moves and when I switch to

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.629 
the camera moves and when I switch to
debugging<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.260> mean<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.920> cameras<00:02:51.250> locked<00:02:51.489> in

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
debugging it mean the cameras locked in

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.420 
debugging it mean the cameras locked in
that<00:02:51.670> position<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.889> put<00:02:54.069> us<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
that position so I just put us in the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.059 
that position so I just put us in the
character<00:02:55.200> where<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.439> him<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.709> and

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
character where I want him to be and

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.160 
character where I want him to be and
then<00:02:57.159> look<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:57.879> I<00:02:58.120> can<00:02:58.930> have<00:02:59.019> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
then look up and then I can have the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.869 
then look up and then I can have the
background<00:02:59.349> shot<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.310> that's<00:03:00.430> pretty<00:03:00.639> cool

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
background shot so that's pretty cool

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.390 
background shot so that's pretty cool
and<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.269> could<00:03:01.500> move<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.709> moving<00:03:03.040> shot<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
and I could move the moving shot in a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.500 
and I could move the moving shot in a
way<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:03.579> that<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> looks<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.030> they<00:03:04.269> were<00:03:04.329> not

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
way so that it looks like they were not

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.990 
way so that it looks like they were not
one<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.500> problems<00:03:05.859> I<00:03:05.950> had<00:03:06.159> was<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.939> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
one of the problems I had was in the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.300 
one of the problems I had was in the
scene<00:03:07.720> where<00:03:07.930> tell<00:03:08.260> says<00:03:08.530> look<00:03:08.769> it's<00:03:08.920> knuckles

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
scene where tell says look it's knuckles

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.520 
scene where tell says look it's knuckles
and<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:09.670> moves<00:03:09.879> over<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.209> see<00:03:10.420> knuckles<00:03:10.810> you'll

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
and it moves over to see knuckles you'll

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.890 
and it moves over to see knuckles you'll
notice<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.069> background<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.670> actually

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
notice that the background is actually

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.479 
notice that the background is actually
different<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:15.099> background

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
different because the background

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.039 
different because the background
actually<00:03:15.609> changes<00:03:16.180> based<00:03:16.389> on<00:03:16.599> where<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
actually changes based on where the

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.680 
actually changes based on where the
character<00:03:17.379> position<00:03:17.739> which<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.389> not<00:03:19.389> good<00:03:19.660> for

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
character position which is not good for

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.289 
character position which is not good for
video<00:03:20.109> but<00:03:20.620> makes<00:03:21.160> sense<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.609> game<00:03:21.819> so

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
video but makes sense in the game so

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.479 
video but makes sense in the game so
that<00:03:22.480> was<00:03:22.599> one<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> problems<00:03:23.199> I<00:03:23.290> had<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.459> I

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
that was one of the problems I had so I

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.039 
that was one of the problems I had so I
just<00:03:24.669> kind<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:24.879> live<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.389> and<00:03:25.840> hopefully

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
just kind of live with it and hopefully

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.050 
just kind of live with it and hopefully
no<00:03:26.379> one<00:03:26.470> will<00:03:26.560> notice<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.889> too<00:03:27.040> much<00:03:27.190> or<00:03:27.519> get

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
no one will notice it too much or get

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.939 
no one will notice it too much or get
bothered<00:03:28.269> by<00:03:28.419> this<00:03:29.319> shot<00:03:29.530> right<00:03:29.650> here<00:03:29.709> is

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
bothered by this shot right here is

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.009 
bothered by this shot right here is
actually<00:03:30.099> a<00:03:30.310> split<00:03:30.579> screen<00:03:30.730> because<00:03:31.150> for

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
actually a split screen because for

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.180 
actually a split screen because for
those<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.169> you<00:03:32.349> that<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.560> played<00:03:32.769> Sonic<00:03:33.099> you

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
those of you that have played Sonic you

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.530 
those of you that have played Sonic you
know<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.370> can't<00:03:33.669> have<00:03:33.849> Sonic<00:03:34.209> Tails<00:03:34.359> and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
know you can't have Sonic Tails and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.689 
know you can't have Sonic Tails and
Knuckles<00:03:34.629> at<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.109> same<00:03:35.290> shot<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.459> had<00:03:36.609> to

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
Knuckles at the same shot so I had to

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:40.890 
Knuckles at the same shot so I had to
just<00:03:36.879> record<00:03:37.209> two<00:03:37.510> different<00:03:39.510> sonic<00:03:40.510> details

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
just record two different sonic details

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.030 
just record two different sonic details
and<00:03:41.139> the<00:03:41.199> other<00:03:41.349> was<00:03:41.729> meant<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.769> shots

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and the other was meant for the shots

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.649 
and the other was meant for the shots
were<00:03:45.190> knuckles<00:03:45.519> moves<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.239> camera<00:03:46.540> would

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
were knuckles moves the camera would

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.539 
were knuckles moves the camera would
move<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.079> well<00:03:47.260> when<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.560> move<00:03:47.709> knuckles<00:03:48.129> so<00:03:48.519> I

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
move as well when I move knuckles so I

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.490 
move as well when I move knuckles so I
had<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.909> actually<00:03:48.970> composite<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:49.930> his

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
had to actually composite in his

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140 
had to actually composite in his
movement<00:03:50.979> like<00:03:51.099> when<00:03:51.250> he<00:03:51.340> jumps<00:03:51.639> off<00:03:51.760> in<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.000> few

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
movement like when he jumps off in a few

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.020 
movement like when he jumps off in a few
seconds<00:03:52.449> here<00:03:52.739> actually<00:03:53.739> had<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.639> in<00:03:54.790> chrome

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
seconds here actually had that in chrome

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.729 
seconds here actually had that in chrome
frame<00:03:55.359> like<00:03:55.569> right<00:03:55.750> there<00:03:55.989> right<00:03:56.470> here<00:03:56.590> when

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
frame like right there right here when

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.839 
frame like right there right here when
Sonic<00:03:57.040> falls<00:03:57.400> off<00:03:57.609> it's<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.269> good<00:03:58.449> example<00:03:58.569> of

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
Sonic falls off it's a good example of

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.369 
Sonic falls off it's a good example of
looking<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:01.030> he<00:04:01.389> fell<00:04:01.629> off<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.900> screen<00:04:02.169> and

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
looking like he fell off the screen and

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.550 
looking like he fell off the screen and
a<00:04:02.530> background<00:04:03.430> shot<00:04:03.959> which<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.109> can<00:04:05.260> do<00:04:05.379> because

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
a background shot which I can do because

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.939 
a background shot which I can do because
it's<00:04:05.829> debug<00:04:06.129> mode<00:04:06.340> which<00:04:06.519> is<00:04:06.669> cool<00:04:07.419> and<00:04:07.949> for

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
it's debug mode which is cool and for

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:09.689 
it's debug mode which is cool and for
those<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.099> you<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.459> played<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.669> game

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
those of you that have played the game

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.460 
those of you that have played the game
probably<00:04:10.150> wonder<00:04:10.359> why<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.540> bridge<00:04:10.840> didn't

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
probably wonder why the bridge didn't

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.750 
probably wonder why the bridge didn't
break<00:04:11.680> when<00:04:11.979> they're<00:04:12.129> standing<00:04:12.430> on<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.639> before

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
break when they're standing on it before

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.909 
break when they're standing on it before
when<00:04:13.659> I<00:04:13.720> was<00:04:13.810> actually<00:04:14.139> able<00:04:14.229> to<00:04:14.319> do<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.739> just

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
when I was actually able to do was just

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.319 
when I was actually able to do was just
create<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.250> bunch<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.579> purges<00:04:15.909> in<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.150> same

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
create a bunch of purges in the same

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.569 
create a bunch of purges in the same
spot<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.989> sort<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.859> glitch<00:04:18.039> in<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.250> game<00:04:18.280> is

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
spot and sort of a glitch in the game is

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.800 
spot and sort of a glitch in the game is
that<00:04:18.729> they<00:04:18.849> won't<00:04:19.030> break<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.599> there's

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
that they won't break if there's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.740 
that they won't break if there's
multiple<00:04:20.109> bridges<00:04:20.709> in<00:04:20.979> one<00:04:21.130> spot<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.570> then

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
multiple bridges in one spot so then

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.480 
multiple bridges in one spot so then
once<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.200> needed<00:04:23.590> him<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.710> fall<00:04:24.039> I<00:04:24.070> just<00:04:24.190> had

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
once I needed him to fall I just had

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.029 
once I needed him to fall I just had
tails

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
tails

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.200 
tails
and<00:04:26.039> every<00:04:26.340> time<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.580> jump<00:04:26.849> one<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
and every time you jump one of the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.659 
and every time you jump one of the
british-based<00:04:27.660> they<00:04:28.139> did<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.099> had<00:04:29.580> him

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
british-based they did so I had him

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.520 
british-based they did so I had him
jumps<00:04:30.120> until<00:04:30.449> there<00:04:30.630> was<00:04:30.720> only<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:31.080> left<00:04:31.259> and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
jumps until there was only one left and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.589 
jumps until there was only one left and
then<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.680> recorded<00:04:32.280> him<00:04:33.030> jumping<00:04:33.389> in<00:04:33.509> the

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
then I recorded him jumping in the

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.659 
then I recorded him jumping in the
bridge<00:04:33.750> breaking<00:04:34.169> this<00:04:34.800> final<00:04:35.130> shot<00:04:35.310> was<00:04:35.460> kind

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
bridge breaking this final shot was kind

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.100 
bridge breaking this final shot was kind
of<00:04:35.699> easy<00:04:35.849> to<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.150> because<00:04:36.300> all<00:04:36.569> I<00:04:36.660> had<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.870> do<00:04:36.990> it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
of easy to do because all I had to do it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.950 
of easy to do because all I had to do it
for<00:04:37.289> just<00:04:37.319> masonic<00:04:38.039> wear<00:04:38.190> knuckles<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:38.960> so

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
for just masonic wear knuckles was so

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240 
for just masonic wear knuckles was so
the<00:04:40.110> camera<00:04:40.440> would<00:04:40.500> be<00:04:40.560> in<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.800> exact<00:04:41.099> same

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
the camera would be in the exact same

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.969 
the camera would be in the exact same
position<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.240> tails<00:04:42.569> is<00:04:43.349> pretty<00:04:43.889> much

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
position and tails is pretty much

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.890 
position and tails is pretty much
independent<00:04:44.490> as<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> camera<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.599> could

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
independent as a camera so I could

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.529 
independent as a camera so I could
easily<00:04:46.020> move<00:04:46.380> him<00:04:46.620> around<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:46.979> stuff<00:04:47.539> still

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
easily move him around and stuff still

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.270
