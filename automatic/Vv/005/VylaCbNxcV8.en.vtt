in the previous tutorial I showed you

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.660 
in the previous tutorial I showed you
how<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> make<00:00:09.570> levels<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> car<00:00:10.679> game<00:00:10.980> where

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
how to make levels for a car game where

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.999 
how to make levels for a car game where
each<00:00:11.849> level<00:00:12.330> was<00:00:12.540> stored<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.259> separate<00:00:13.710> file

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
each level was stored in a separate file

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.240 
each level was stored in a separate file
in<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.750> tutorial<00:00:15.990> I'll<00:00:16.590> show<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.949> how<00:00:17.070> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
in this tutorial I'll show you how to
make<00:00:17.430> levels<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> car<00:00:18.359> game<00:00:18.630> where<00:00:19.320> each

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
make levels for a car game where each

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
make levels for a car game where each
level<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> scene<00:00:20.699> within<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> same<00:00:21.869> blender

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

file<00:00:22.680> I'm<00:00:23.180> going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> start<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.810> opening<00:00:25.430> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
file I'm going to start by opening the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.519 
file I'm going to start by opening the
first<00:00:26.880> car<00:00:27.240> level<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.960> made<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
first car level that I made in the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.900 
first car level that I made in the
previous<00:00:28.650> tutorial

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.700 

the<00:00:32.450> first<00:00:32.720> thing<00:00:32.870> I'm<00:00:33.020> going<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.260> do<00:00:33.470> is

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.330 
the first thing I'm going to do is
delete<00:00:34.130> this<00:00:34.400> game<00:00:34.670> actuator<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:36.260> loads<00:00:36.710> level

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
delete this game actuator it loads level

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.180 
delete this game actuator it loads level
two<00:00:37.550> as<00:00:37.880> a<00:00:37.910> separate<00:00:38.540> file<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.070> old

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
two as a separate file in the old

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.760 
two as a separate file in the old
version<00:00:40.489> all<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.629> levels<00:00:41.870> were<00:00:42.320> separate

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
version all the levels were separate

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.790 
version all the levels were separate
files<00:00:43.100> in<00:00:43.400> this<00:00:43.790> new<00:00:44.120> version<00:00:44.360> all<00:00:45.230> the<00:00:45.559> levels

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
files in this new version all the levels

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.110 
files in this new version all the levels
will<00:00:46.129> be<00:00:46.160> scenes<00:00:46.670> within<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.540> same<00:00:47.809> file<00:00:49.120> now

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
will be scenes within the same file now

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.400 
will be scenes within the same file now
I'm<00:00:50.300> going<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.480> give<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.720> scene<00:00:50.960> a<00:00:51.170> more

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
I'm going to give the scene a more

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.340 
I'm going to give the scene a more
meaningful<00:00:51.559> name<00:00:52.960> level<00:00:53.960> 1<00:00:54.489> chess<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.840> I'm

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
meaningful name level 1 chess and I'm

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.460 
meaningful name level 1 chess and I'm
going<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.739> add<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.160> new<00:00:58.489> scene<00:00:59.059> for<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.140> next

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
going to add a new scene for the next

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.310 
going to add a new scene for the next
level<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.040> we<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:02.000> choose<00:01:02.269> which<00:01:02.780> option

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.650

choosing the new or the copy settings

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.609 
choosing the new or the copy settings
options<00:01:09.200> creates<00:01:10.190> an<00:01:10.430> empty<00:01:11.030> new<00:01:11.240> scene<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:12.590> I

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
options creates an empty new scene but I

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.410 
options creates an empty new scene but I
want<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.009> at<00:01:13.100> least<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.460> car<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.910> be<00:01:14.030> copied

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
want to at least the car to be copied

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.389 
want to at least the car to be copied
over<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.930> drive<00:01:15.170> around<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.649> new<00:01:15.800> level<00:01:16.190> and

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
over to drive around the new level and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.180 
over to drive around the new level and
these<00:01:17.270> two<00:01:17.539> options<00:01:18.020> offer<00:01:18.289> little<00:01:18.649> benefit

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
these two options offer little benefit

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.830 
these two options offer little benefit
over<00:01:19.640> separate<00:01:20.090> files

window the objects are the same as in
level<00:01:42.850> 1<00:01:43.090> but<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:44.140> can't<00:01:44.380> have<00:01:44.530> two<00:01:44.709> objects

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
level 1 but you can't have two objects

level 1 but you can't have two objects
with<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.310> same<00:01:45.340> name<00:01:45.819> so<00:01:46.149> they've<00:01:46.329> been

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
with the same name so they've been

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.660 
with the same name so they've been
renamed<00:01:47.069> if<00:01:48.069> I<00:01:48.189> start<00:01:48.609> the<00:01:49.030> scene<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:51.189> car<00:01:51.399> has

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
renamed if I start the scene the car has

renamed if I start the scene the car has
no<00:01:51.700> wheels<00:01:52.149> the<00:01:53.049> scripts<00:01:53.469> are<00:01:53.740> looking<00:01:54.219> for

no wheels the scripts are looking for

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.410 
no wheels the scripts are looking for
the<00:01:54.670> objects<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.390> they've<00:01:55.569> been<00:01:55.750> renamed<00:01:56.200> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the objects but they've been renamed I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.229 
the objects but they've been renamed I
could<00:01:58.420> edit<00:01:58.689> scripts<00:01:59.590> but<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.399> need<00:02:00.729> two<00:02:00.939> sets

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
could edit scripts but I need two sets

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.690 
could edit scripts but I need two sets
of<00:02:01.390> scripts<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.439> soon<00:02:02.709> become<00:02:03.159> very

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
of scripts so it soon become very

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.430 
of scripts so it soon become very
complicated<00:02:05.789> choosing<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:06.899> link<00:02:07.899> objects

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
complicated choosing the link objects

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.330 
complicated choosing the link objects
option<00:02:08.979> works<00:02:09.369> best<00:02:09.759> for<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> car<00:02:10.329> game<00:02:11.010> if<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
option works best for the car game if I

option works best for the car game if I
name<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.150> new<00:02:13.299> seem<00:02:13.739> level<00:02:14.739> 2<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.780> take<00:02:16.780> a

name the new seem level 2 and take a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.509 
name the new seem level 2 and take a
look<00:02:16.989> at<00:02:17.110> its<00:02:17.260> contents<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.190> outliner

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
look at its contents in the outliner

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.479 
look at its contents in the outliner
window<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:19.569> see<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.530> has<00:02:20.590> exactly<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
window we see that it has exactly the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.150 
window we see that it has exactly the
same<00:02:21.730> objects<00:02:22.299> as<00:02:22.420> level<00:02:22.900> 1<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.980> not

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
same objects as level 1 so not

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.830 
same objects as level 1 so not
surprisingly<00:02:24.310> when<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.090> start<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> game

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
surprisingly when I start the game

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.879 
surprisingly when I start the game
engine<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.530> works<00:02:27.329> both<00:02:28.329> level<00:02:28.959> 1<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.380> level<00:02:29.470> 2

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
engine it works both level 1 and level 2
