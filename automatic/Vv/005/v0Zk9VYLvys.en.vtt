00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 and there personal pure beauty but a video 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.390
 here for you our partnership with 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.840
 car school of health sciences 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.519
 Teacher is nosi in this video that we 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 Let's talk here a little bit 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.770
 genetic variations of the individuals who 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.510
 contribute to different profiles 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.580
 growth of muscle mass using 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.789
 and anabolic steroids 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.560
 if you watched the video we did 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 for hormone signaling 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.570
 steroids 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 you will see that it does not depend only on the world 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.149
 installed is actually a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 all the puzzle to build 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.780
 the last index and inject into the famous 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.480
 bomb that friend made by rogelio and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 also individuals here also was me 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.260
 I do not know how to draw. I have no idea. 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.070
 drawing drawing for us look at the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 Reggae is good so what happens 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.129
 we depend on several other factors 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.340
 to be able to develop a characteristic 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.430
 or if there are xenobiotics and 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.189
 since it is one of us is the characteristic of the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.729
 of the individual when he appears 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.939
 that is, it becomes something 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 functional 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.630
 we have very well 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.580
 we have two guys they are 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 many different 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:32.159
 they are different between them or c 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.509
 today ours is very well and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.360
 these levels 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.060
 the two about it they decided not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 so fly what they did not do 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.960
 finally see that only one of them 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.299
 this is prohibited by law and you can not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.720
 sterols use anabolic hormones 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.780
 to be great, this does not exist anymore 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 we know that many people do the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 two is good so hurried 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.469
 the two went to the academy of the nero in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.899
 head of the two and then tell me what to 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.090
 forget and stay in bonn the 2 that neither is 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.640
 incredible what you need 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:20.400
 our clothes here then the two of them do 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:24.239
 good already injected love of the two 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.629
 injected the pump into the body 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.590
 the quantity is the same or both 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.470
 the same amount of pump in the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.849
 organism thinking that it would not only be 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.500
 there is one very important thing that is 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.739
 Rogerio said in his video 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 genetics depends a lot on ge net 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.890
 she will often control the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.750
 quantity of these products which are 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.000
 produced by our body is the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 Dream nine years winner will 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.720
 receive here the heroes that will run 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.510
 completion to activate 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.670
 jeff on what will connect to df receiver 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.129
 just remembering that it is a growth factor 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.340
 of the insulin that is descending from 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.860
 insulin but is not that read has used the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.709
 have another protein that is to activate 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.010
 when we activate this sector 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.380
 look well we have a bitoque is the girl 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.470
 eyes for the construction of the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.430
 muscle mass is something that will promote 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.950
 synthesis of proteins in the world very well 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.019
 then it depends on all these factors not 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.569
 It's only the bomb that will effect the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.950
 it depends on all the vain united states 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.170
 continue to be between our two 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.150
 individuals here for us to understand 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.630
 how genetics works in this 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.790
 process such as the genotype 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.829
 two individuals is different 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.459
 we'll put together an idea of one 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:58.889
 fracture in his hand he has a question 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.560
 in the air he has more quantity 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.709
 quantity is also a larger quantity 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.709
 of all those products that participate 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.660
 of muscle building life 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.890
 sure the individual 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.410
 and it has the merit of everyone here so I am 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.790
 a generic example to make it easy to 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.740
 understand very well then after we know 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.060
 that both individual and individual 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.120
 blessing to manage everything is and there our use 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.820
 oxy each being 15 b have a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.000
 the smaller quantity of these products that is 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.310
 edited by its genetics, ie the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.110
 days he has any changes whatsoever 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.970
 modification that makes them 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.710
 these products do not produce less 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.880
 It needs to be all can be one of them but 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.600
 I put everyone to stay easy to 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.840
 understand 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.960
 in individual bid looks only 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.770
 if you have more of these 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.990
 products 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.660
 You do not agree with me that if I have 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.060
 the age of majority will activate the largest 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.390
 amount of others go more mass 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.880
 muscular that the individual b has a 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.650
 the smaller amount of these products you 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.590
 You also do not agree with me that they will 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.090
 produce less muscle mass and is 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.620
 fact that happens 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.110
 this second, the individuals who have 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.320
 different amounts of production 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.530
 these products do not know but others have 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.250
 less and those who have less money only speak 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.140
 who are generally afraid not to 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.960
 can produce both muscle mass 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:37.260
 gent then is the individual and one possession 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.060
 face that has a reduced speed 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.400
 of these products that pay if it goes 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.640
 accept but who will grow a 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.960
 bit is not going to be an end or the 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.650
 maximum that it can turn into an incredible 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.150
 hulk before processing too 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.880
 Welcome to the sheet that has a quantity 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.230
 largest of these products that will happen 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.810
 it will produce more muscle mass 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.150
 maybe it will become a tribute 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:11.169
 because it is a larger amount 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:14.080
 I do not see the pump works but works 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.980
 if you have different quantities of these 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.840
 products 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.790
 the effect that will vary 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.770
 because the individual has poison from the 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.820
 quantity of these products and one thing 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.380
 very interesting 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:30.490
 there are people who think for example can 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:33.280
 be done in this way or not 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.010
 answer right is a guy can take a 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.949
 truck a ton of being obvious that he 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.440
 will continue for example with whatever 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:47.500
 one yellow 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:50.020
 sam is very cruel at last they defended that 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.360
 some of these guides may 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.419
 action of the sectors we can never 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.780
 count how much you want to grow in name 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:01.210
 person likes this explanation without 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:04.240
 The magic of our dearest wish 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.790
 My friend, Rogerio, did you like that jewel? 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.289
 to assist in spreading the video 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.610
 shares goes through your friends where 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.160
 I understand very interesting if 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:16.050
 discuss in this piece brings you there can embrace 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.050
 everyone stay with God and even the relationship
