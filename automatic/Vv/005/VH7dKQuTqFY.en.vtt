00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
were fun star commander but they they

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
were fun star commander but they they
weren't<00:00:49.860> they<00:00:50.160> didn't<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.789> capture<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930 
weren't they didn't really capture you
yet<00:00:51.899> even<00:00:52.559> when<00:00:52.829> Nintendo<00:00:53.250> first<00:00:53.520> came<00:00:53.760> out

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
yet even when Nintendo first came out

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
yet even when Nintendo first came out
yet<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.360> Mike<00:00:54.570> Tyson's<00:00:54.960> punch-out<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.190> had

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
yet like Mike Tyson's punch-out you had

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
yet like Mike Tyson's punch-out you had
the<00:00:56.489> Super<00:00:56.760> Mario<00:00:57.030> Brothers<00:00:57.480> game<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the Super Mario Brothers game and that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.459 
the Super Mario Brothers game and that
was<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:58.710> exciting<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> think<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.469> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
was very exciting but I think for me the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.620 
was very exciting but I think for me the
game<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.340> did<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.850> was<00:01:03.480> metroid

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.040 

you

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.250 

I<00:01:11.630> think<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> game<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.500> wasn't<00:01:14.310> linear<00:01:15.120> it<00:01:15.870> you

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
I think a game that wasn't linear it you

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.080 
I think a game that wasn't linear it you
could<00:01:16.440> you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.220> had<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.490> follow<00:01:17.700> some

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
could you know you had to follow some

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
could you know you had to follow some
steps<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.690> certain<00:01:18.870> way<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.920> did<00:01:20.160> have

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
steps in a certain way but you did have

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
steps in a certain way but you did have
freedom<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.390> forever<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.260> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
freedom at forever a little bit in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
freedom at forever a little bit in the
game<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> started<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> game<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.290> went

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
game so you started the game you went

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.860 
game so you started the game you went
out<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:25.980> more<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.190> an<00:01:26.310> adventure<00:01:26.750> than<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
out it was more of an adventure than it

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.970 
out it was more of an adventure than it
was<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:29.010> linear<00:01:29.810> progression<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.470> like

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
was this linear progression like like

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.340 
was this linear progression like like
super<00:01:32.190> mario<00:01:32.370> was<00:01:32.940> those<00:01:33.330> who<00:01:33.360> mara<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:34.080> fun

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
super mario was those who mara was fun

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
super mario was those who mara was fun
and<00:01:34.500> exciting<00:01:34.590> but<00:01:35.010> i<00:01:35.580> think<00:01:35.760> metroid<00:01:36.270> was

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and exciting but i think metroid was

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.920 
and exciting but i think metroid was
really<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.870> captured<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.380> mind<00:01:37.920> um<00:01:38.930> going

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really what captured my mind um going

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.320 
really what captured my mind um going
through<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.230> game<00:01:40.440> playing<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:42.180> know

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
through that game playing it you know

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.450 
through that game playing it you know
upgrading<00:01:43.230> yourself<00:01:43.680> getting<00:01:43.950> missiles

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
upgrading yourself getting missiles

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.610 
upgrading yourself getting missiles
getting<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.210> roll<00:01:45.420> technique<00:01:45.660> getting<00:01:46.230> all

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
getting the roll technique getting all

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.080 
getting the roll technique getting all
these<00:01:46.860> different<00:01:47.160> techniques<00:01:47.670> double

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
these different techniques double

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
these different techniques double
jumping<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.080> just<00:01:49.320> made<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.620> game<00:01:49.980> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
jumping it just made the game it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.970 
jumping it just made the game it
provided<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.090> extra<00:01:51.600> level<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.960> depth<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
provided that extra level of depth and I

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.120 
provided that extra level of depth and I
think<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.230> level<00:01:55.230> of<00:01:55.320> depth<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
think that was the level of depth that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.360 
think that was the level of depth that
people<00:01:56.910> took<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.540> say<00:01:57.960> wow<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
people took to say wow you can really

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.430 
people took to say wow you can really
