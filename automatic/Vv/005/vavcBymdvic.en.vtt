so first off I'm going to do the
standard<00:00:13.920> native<00:00:14.250> resolution<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> game

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
standard native resolution of the game

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000 
standard native resolution of the game
what<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.960> I'm<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> show<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.440> the

Stark stating is right now except I

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.870 
Stark stating is right now except I
changed<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> that's<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.410> auto<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.699> know

changed that that's on auto but you know
you<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.480> why<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> changed<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you don't know why I changed it to that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.970 
you don't know why I changed it to that
later<00:00:22.590> on

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
later on

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.120 
later on
so<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.939> need<00:00:24.090> BR<00:00:24.359> DirectX<00:00:24.900> 11<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.380> stock<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so you need BR DirectX 11 in stock this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.710 
so you need BR DirectX 11 in stock this
is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> stock<00:00:26.640> native<00:00:27.060> resolution<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is a stock native resolution and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
is a stock native resolution and
everything<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.470> let<00:00:28.800> me<00:00:28.859> start<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.400> real

quick game pokemon stadium that works so
you<00:00:54.719> see<00:00:54.960> how<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.890> quick<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.399> taste<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
you see how this quick little taste as a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.450 
you see how this quick little taste as a
native<00:00:57.149> resolution<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.350> how<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
native resolution as it is how is a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
native resolution as it is how is a
pixelated<00:01:00.180> everything<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.500> need

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
pixelated everything that's what we need

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.750 
pixelated everything that's what we need
to<00:01:02.250> change

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
to change

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.080 
to change
so<00:01:04.250> that's<00:01:05.250> won't<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.700> back<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so that's won't go go back to the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
so that's won't go go back to the
desktop<00:01:06.390> ah<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:08.840> pump<00:01:09.840> again<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
desktop ah I pump again they go back to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.149 
desktop ah I pump again they go back to
the<00:01:10.710> desktop<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:16.159> we're

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the desktop and get out of that so we're

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
the desktop and get out of that so we're
still<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.400> game<00:01:17.759> right<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.509> back<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
still in game right here now go back to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
still in game right here now go back to
graphics<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.729> we're<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
graphics and we're right here with this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.179 
graphics and we're right here with this
aspect<00:01:21.990> ratio<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> reason<00:01:23.070> why<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
aspect ratio this is the reason why I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.480 
aspect ratio this is the reason why I
said<00:01:23.549> force<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.450> 16<00:01:24.869> by<00:01:25.020> 9<00:01:25.220> because<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
said force to 16 by 9 because when you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.649 
said force to 16 by 9 because when you
blow<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.180> stretched<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
blow it up you're actually stretched it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.179 
blow it up you're actually stretched it
out<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> screen<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.009> saw

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
out the screen because when you saw

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
out the screen because when you saw
earlier<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.790> stretches<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> screen<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> just

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
earlier it stretches the screen and just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.160 
earlier it stretches the screen and just
having<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.380> little<00:01:31.619> area<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.820> had<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
having a little area that it had so and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.770 
having a little area that it had so and
to<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.189> negative<00:01:35.460> fit<00:01:35.579> resolution<00:01:36.119> HD<00:01:36.360> if

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
to get the negative fit resolution HD if

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
to get the negative fit resolution HD if
you<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> laptop<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.860> don't<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.490> 1280

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
you go on the laptop I don't like 1280

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
you go on the laptop I don't like 1280
or<00:01:39.090> whatnot<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> TV<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
or whatnot but if you're on a TV or a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.690 
or whatnot but if you're on a TV or a
better<00:01:42.030> resolution<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:43.350> 1920<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.250> 1080

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
better resolution like 1920 by 1080

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840 
better resolution like 1920 by 1080
that's<00:01:45.090> why<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> put<00:01:45.390> -<00:01:45.890> anti-aliasing<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.130> pull

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that's why I put - anti-aliasing I pull

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.830 
that's why I put - anti-aliasing I pull
it<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> 4<00:01:48.899> sample<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it on a 4 sample and all this all the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.300 
it on a 4 sample and all this all the
way<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> 16<00:01:52.470> X<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.799> reason<00:01:52.920> why<00:01:53.189> I'm

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
way up to 16 X the reason why I'm

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.410 
way up to 16 X the reason why I'm
putting<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.549> settings<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.119> because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
putting my settings like this because

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
putting my settings like this because
the<00:01:54.509> graph<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.720> correct<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.590> CPU<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.369> have

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the graph is correct I have a CPU I have

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.950 
the graph is correct I have a CPU I have
a<00:01:57.829> 7850<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.070> 2<00:01:59.430> gigabytes<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.090> gddr5

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
a 7850 that's 2 gigabytes of gddr5

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.319 
a 7850 that's 2 gigabytes of gddr5
that's<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> reason<00:02:01.920> why<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.280> run<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.640> but

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that's the reason why I can run this but

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
that's the reason why I can run this but
I<00:02:03.360> will<00:02:03.689> prefer<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> run<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
I will prefer to run this if you have a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
I will prefer to run this if you have a
Tandy<00:02:05.340> card<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.210> OpenCL<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.380> can

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
Tandy card and OpenCL because you can

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020 
Tandy card and OpenCL because you can
run<00:02:07.590> everything<00:02:07.979> full<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> way<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
run everything full all the way and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.150 
run everything full all the way and
he'll<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.569> no<00:02:09.810> lag<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.709> I'll<00:02:10.860> someone

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
he'll just have no lag and I'll someone

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.070 
he'll just have no lag and I'll someone
put<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> show<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> FPS<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.480> running<00:02:12.690> in

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
put the show the FPS that I'm running in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.870 
put the show the FPS that I'm running in
so<00:02:14.570> exit<00:02:15.570> out<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.520> blow<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.700> back

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
so exit out of this and blow this back

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.850 
so exit out of this and blow this back
up<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.180> full<00:02:18.390> screen<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.530> will<00:02:19.650> see<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860
