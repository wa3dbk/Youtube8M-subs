shutter<00:01:32.009> count<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> very

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
shutter count because that is very

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
shutter count because that is very
important<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.320> you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.860> buy<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> used

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
important if you're going to buy a used

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
important if you're going to buy a used
camera<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.270> need<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.049> has

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
camera you need to make sure that it has

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
camera you need to make sure that it has
a<00:01:37.170> low<00:01:37.500> shutter<00:01:37.799> count<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.670> DSLR<00:01:39.270> cameras

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a low shutter count because DSLR cameras

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
a low shutter count because DSLR cameras
are<00:01:39.840> high<00:01:40.049> maintenance<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.680> after<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.159> many

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
are high maintenance and after so many

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.490 
are high maintenance and after so many
shutter<00:01:41.700> counts<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> actual<00:01:42.840> sensor<00:01:43.229> inside

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
shutter counts the actual sensor inside

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
shutter counts the actual sensor inside
and<00:01:43.799> all<00:01:43.890> these<00:01:44.040> different<00:01:44.189> things<00:01:44.490> will

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and all these different things will

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.110 
and all these different things will
start<00:01:44.880> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.240> messing<00:01:45.600> up

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
start kind of messing up

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.970 
start kind of messing up
and<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.540> will<00:01:46.810> lead<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.200> replace<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.800> which

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
and it will lead you to replace it which

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.580 
and it will lead you to replace it which
is<00:01:48.100> like<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> 200<00:01:48.760> $300<00:01:49.300> fix<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.320> want<00:01:50.530> to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
is like a 200 $300 fix so you want to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.010 
is like a 200 $300 fix so you want to
make<00:01:50.680> sure<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.190> do<00:01:51.400> get<00:01:51.760> a<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.540> know<00:01:52.660> low

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
make sure that you do get a you know low

with<00:02:19.720> filming<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.290> had<00:02:20.530> realized<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:22.120> did

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
with filming I had realized that it did

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
with filming I had realized that it did
not<00:02:22.570> have<00:02:22.780> autofocus<00:02:23.500> or<00:02:23.770> what<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.280> was

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
not have autofocus or what I was

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.190 
not have autofocus or what I was
understanding<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.180> on<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> focus<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.930> always

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
understanding was on a focus I always

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.690 
understanding was on a focus I always
saw<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> lens<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.100> had<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.490> choice

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
saw on the lens that I had the choice

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.460 
saw on the lens that I had the choice
for<00:02:28.030> autofocus<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.230> oh<00:02:29.410> it's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
for autofocus on it and I'm like oh it's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.710 
for autofocus on it and I'm like oh it's
autofocus<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.550> like<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> point<00:02:31.030> shoe<00:02:31.330> you

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
autofocus just like a point shoe you

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390 
autofocus just like a point shoe you
know<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.050> walk<00:02:32.260> by<00:02:32.410> it's<00:02:32.620> gonna<00:02:32.800> focus<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.220> me

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
know if I walk by it's gonna focus on me

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.460 
know if I walk by it's gonna focus on me
just<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.670> pointing<00:02:34.030> shoots<00:02:34.300> do<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.780> I

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
just like pointing shoots do and I

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.960 
just like pointing shoots do and I
quickly<00:02:35.890> learned<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.670> not<00:02:36.790> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
quickly learned that that is not the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.480 
quickly learned that that is not the
case<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:38.170> know<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.650> autofocus<00:02:39.070> what

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
case you know you have to autofocus what

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.100 
case you know you have to autofocus what
you're<00:02:39.610> doing<00:02:39.850> video<00:02:40.060> at<00:02:40.330> least<00:02:40.360> when<00:02:40.990> you're

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
you're doing video at least when you're

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.300 
you're doing video at least when you're
doing<00:02:41.320> video<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> have<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.950> make<00:02:42.070> sure<00:02:42.100> you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
doing video you have to make sure you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
doing video you have to make sure you
autofocus<00:02:42.910> before<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.500> know<00:02:44.530> start

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
autofocus before you you know start

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.290 
autofocus before you you know start
filming<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.880> was<00:02:45.970> something<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
filming and that was something that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.820 
filming and that was something that
really<00:02:46.450> wasn't<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.080> big<00:02:47.260> deal<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.770> I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
really wasn't a big deal because I

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.610 
really wasn't a big deal because I
actually<00:02:48.130> do<00:02:48.520> have<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:49.030> remote<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.230> wasn't

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
actually do have a remote so it wasn't

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.170 
actually do have a remote so it wasn't
that<00:02:50.739> big<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.220> deal<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:51.880> thinking

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
that big of a deal but I was thinking

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.120 
that big of a deal but I was thinking
you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.080> get<00:02:53.350> ready<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.739> me<00:02:53.770> and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
you know what I do get ready with me and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.949 
you know what I do get ready with me and
I'm<00:02:54.220> walking<00:02:54.550> around<00:02:54.640> or<00:02:55.090> maybe<00:02:55.270> I'm<00:02:55.450> doing<00:02:55.600> an

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
I'm walking around or maybe I'm doing an

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.390 
I'm walking around or maybe I'm doing an
establishing<00:02:56.500> shot<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.040> want<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.280> make<00:02:57.370> sure

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
establishing shot I want to make sure

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.699 
establishing shot I want to make sure
that<00:02:57.730> everything<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.270> auto<00:02:58.480> focusing<00:02:58.930> or<00:02:59.560> at

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that everything is auto focusing or at

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.010 
that everything is auto focusing or at
least<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.040> was<00:03:00.100> my<00:03:00.220> mindset<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.390> I<00:03:01.420> then

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
least that was my mindset so I then

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.199 
least that was my mindset so I then
looked<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.370> could<00:03:03.550> find<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:04.030> good

this is the t4i and this is mainly the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.089 
this is the t4i and this is mainly the
main<00:04:01.549> difference<00:04:01.969> of<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.269> t4<00:04:02.599> to<00:04:02.870> t3<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.500> as<00:04:03.859> far

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
main difference of the t4 to t3 I as far

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.580 
main difference of the t4 to t3 I as far
as<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.459> body<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.760> concerned<00:04:04.849> on<00:04:05.359> the<00:04:05.959> t4i<00:04:06.379> you

a<00:04:24.889> DSLR<00:04:25.930> autofocus<00:04:26.930> is<00:04:27.139> not<00:04:27.530> what<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.889> guys

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
a DSLR autofocus is not what you guys

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.080 
a DSLR autofocus is not what you guys
may<00:04:28.460> think<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.789> is

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
may think it is

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.810 
may think it is
it<00:04:29.330> will<00:04:29.780> autofocus<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:30.889> always<00:04:31.160> blurs

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
it will autofocus but it always blurs

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.670 
it will autofocus but it always blurs
out<00:04:32.090> before<00:04:32.509> it<00:04:32.599> comes<00:04:32.810> back<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.349> takes<00:04:33.530> a

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
out before it comes back in and takes a

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920 
out before it comes back in and takes a
focus<00:04:34.039> on<00:04:34.220> whatever<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.729> subject<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
focus on whatever the subject is so the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.540
