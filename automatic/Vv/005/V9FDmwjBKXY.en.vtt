00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
making other plans and basically I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
making other plans and basically I
started<00:02:07.590> off<00:02:07.740> life<00:02:07.950> using<00:02:08.459> subcontractors

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
started off life using subcontractors

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.669 
started off life using subcontractors
and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.949 
and
and<00:02:09.769> then<00:02:10.129> we<00:02:10.849> had<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> miners<00:02:11.540> strike<00:02:11.569> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959

everything<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.379> in<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.829> end<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:13.159> ended<00:02:13.519> up

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
everything and I in the end I ended up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.420 
everything and I in the end I ended up
doing<00:02:13.849> everything<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:15.079> built<00:02:15.590> for<00:02:15.829> houses<00:02:16.099> them

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
doing everything I built for houses them

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.039 
doing everything I built for houses them
up<00:02:16.579> with<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:16.879> own<00:02:17.000> hands<00:02:17.299> doing<00:02:17.719> all<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
up with my own hands doing all the

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.490 
up with my own hands doing all the
trades<00:02:18.319> and<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.189> therefore<00:02:19.579> to<00:02:20.180> me<00:02:20.329> again<00:02:21.319> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
trades and so therefore to me again and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.339 
trades and so therefore to me again and
it's<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.709> natural<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.489> use<00:02:22.700> subcontractors

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
it's just natural to use subcontractors

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.319 
it's just natural to use subcontractors
I<00:02:24.349> no<00:02:24.709> longer<00:02:24.920> use<00:02:25.099> my<00:02:25.310> own<00:02:25.459> hands

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329
