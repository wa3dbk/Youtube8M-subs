00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.920
 demo output around half past two 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.170
 morning always on xbox one on pc will come out 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 in a few hours and on playstation 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.050
 honestly I don't know why a 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.670
 playstation cia the let's say exit 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.469
 of wall ideas etcetera 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 just the next day because as 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.309
 love psn maintenance then 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.930
 the outermost is updated 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.210
 next day with Wednesday is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.399
 it is always always so though however if 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.390
 the demo will also be released today 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.589
 having said that today will be a very video 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 particular because today it was evident 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.340
 two first impressions on this demo not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 you don't even have a two prepared speech 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.570
 become improvised 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 then let's start immediately what 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.770
 we immediately notice as soon as we have the demo is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.750
 the graphics the graphics have changed a lot 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 as you know the whole premier league 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 is fired so then you have top 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.080
 site that the premier league 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 below or serious commentators 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.799
 in fact the commentator this thing that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.509
 I was very impressed on a TV commentator 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.460
 certain point says that liverpool is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.009
 singing you'll never walk alone 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.509
 as you well know is the anthem the motto of 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.520
 liverpool but also the other teams between 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.560
 the famous for the free then made a 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 at some point you see the fans that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.600
 they raise these barriers here from liverpool 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 such as 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.299
 and make it into the cart that later 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.860
 from here I'll show you also let's say 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.330
 the video below in description of the will 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.190
 with them and if you compare them 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.540
 pretty much the same thing and it has me 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.009
 hit of these commentator here 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.190
 anyway if I don't know who he is now 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.970
 however famous surely to be part 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:08.890
 let's say you do this in practice 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.959
 you'll never walk alone then how has 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 said the graphics have changed a lot 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.600
 well you know the fifa 14 out of three 60 was 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.970
 transported on men there is therefore from old 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 age annex 14 were transported 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.230
 the graphics had been improved but not 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.670
 well defined but now it will be possible 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.880
 notice the difference because of its own 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.739
 was designed for xbox one with 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.319
 console with in these years next gen 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.590
 I can tell you that we note an optimal of 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.810
 spheres in sums also on the fact that yes 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.370
 therefore the field deteriorates 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 if we start with the beautiful field 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.519
 clean and so on and so on 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.280
 point of the game that football does 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.160
 shit and let's face problems in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.250
 when we move in the field 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 because the ball runs less less e 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.560
 suffers from the let's say problems in the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.019
 make the transition a bit like rain 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.160
 on the other ones then it was something else 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.540
 which I noticed are the players that yes 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.130
 it hurts the boys 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 that is, I am practically jumping with 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.549
 my defender my sti defender 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.769
 clinging to the midfielder of 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.720
 manchester city and the midfielder of the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.910
 manchester city broke then there is 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.010
 now we could rally between 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.320
 quotes the opposing midfielder 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.019
 and that one can fall badly by taking oneself from 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.329
 a sprain a rom chip for an arm 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.830
 and this player but then we say 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.450
 brought out as always e 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.300
 and there is this fair play that one is anyway 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.130
 already seen up until 14 another thing a lot 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.960
 but the fact of changing is very pretty 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.730
 players as you have seen well now i 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.030
 players there is this statistic 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 here I saw in the career of fifa 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.800
 where in practice you can see the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.350
 statistics c 3 c 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.210
 let's say this game was a lot 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.560
 compact on the reciprocated graphics 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.320
 much to the challenge but also gameplay 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.670
 because if you try to play you can 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.640
 notice how there is a small one 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.100
 difference from the fifa 14 this creates a 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.900
 much more fluid game these are 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.880
 girls impressions we will take in 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.240
 detail for launches that when the 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 we'll talk about it a lot more fluid and 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.140
 above all I noticed that the passages yes 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.209
 they can make mistakes 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.190
 so there is not really that football 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.860
 automatic that there has always been well 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.209
 you know the launches on 14 are automatic a 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.790
 unless you see manual steps 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.170
 but the automatic ones or systems anyway 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.480
 automatic on the fact the launch the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.080
 balloon arrives on the legs of the 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.820
 of the other attacker 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.040
 here, however, I have seen that it is possible 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.310
 make a mistake 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.740
 I noticed that the players are a lot 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.600
 which is to say in 11 he said before 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.660
 very good graph a lot of work on 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.990
 graphic this we say a small one 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.520
 impression on the complaint 15 will make us 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.990
 also try the latest estimates mode 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.080
 after in fact between a child and it will come out 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.720
 tomorrow after built here i saw 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.310
 this goal by sturridge 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.680
 something absurd about the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.700
 goalkeeper the keeper as you well know it is 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.620
 next gen 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.330
 so even doing free I saw that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.580
 they make the paper ax absurd for 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.140
 additional wait for scheme so to do 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.570
 so that even the goalkeeper can make mistakes 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.790
 as usual catori we say this 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.680
 office I liked now look 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.180
 a demo cannot be said to be launched that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.460
 you are looking towards a never walk 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.770
 halo by titles with books e 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.440
 I must say that it is something absurd for 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.600
 those who follow English football come these 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.070
 he really doesn't like things 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.490
 another thing besides the doormen make it 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.530
 of the absurd errors is the factor that 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.970
 as you saw after post game e 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.650
 half a game 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.020
 the inverted quotation actions that 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.340
 summarize the game are made in a 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.470
 so that seems to watch a game 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.660
 soccer there is you present when you sky 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.750
 in the middle of the game he shows the highlights 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.310
 of the match of the first half and yes 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.610
 see everything I'll stay but so here is 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.710
 something devastating the insipid catta 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.940
 causes the you to be as if it will follow 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.470
 in your life because you are to be of 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.810
 a person external to the face 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.180
 here for them goes away with you are seeing 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.750
 a match because it is so real that 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.910
 this we say 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.669
 and evident this graphic makes it here 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.680
 like a game like a game like one 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.750
 normal game so you see how i 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.479
 liverpool celebrations have been seen 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.830
 the cup and the boys lack ten 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.120
 seconds I hope the video is there 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.530
 liked not to say seems to let me 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.940
 like to write channel 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.550
 I hope this first video these 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.889
 first impressions of fifa 15 can 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:29.370
 be serve it see you tomorrow with 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.370
 video on the team on tv from
