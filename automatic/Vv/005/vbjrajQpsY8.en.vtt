00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.299
 is a student of the singing academy 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.299
 it is neither more nor less than Mr. 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.500
 ale sergi 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.590
 sometimes 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.100
 the song 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.170
 good referent of the song here in the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.380
 Argentina will sing with the singer 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.060
 masked I'm noticing that we surrender 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:47.610
 more after some than not in groups 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:55.430
 because we are getting clearer and the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.890
 chopped we reach and next time 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.410
 for coming the three good points that go 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.660
 do we will make a delicious topic 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.630
 from a colleague called a joist who 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.430
 French David as we say 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.780
 which just matches the name of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 this issue with the last something that has 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.120
 taken out that is titanium 30 years now I 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.860
 it's surprising because this must disturb me 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.540
 I know him and then those who go 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.280
 literally translate Spanish yes 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.869
 because the translation they had done 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.000
 before I do not know who the Russian chi is 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.060
 the sings is a disaster the have 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.340
 He has accommodated his 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.960
 convenient and so anyone sings it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.390
 sir we did the translation 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 Exactly how it has to be good I'm going to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.720
 present it then to the singer more 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.670
 expensive if it seems good as one of the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 students do not do not do not yell at you do not give 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.960
 because if I respect him a lot it's the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.280
 teacher in this process I'm going to 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.610
 say something what they are screaming 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.869
 the sky may be very high but 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.869
 It is also played with the floor
