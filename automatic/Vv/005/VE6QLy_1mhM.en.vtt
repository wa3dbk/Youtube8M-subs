00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.110
 of giordano can not be said that it is not 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.590
 an intelligent man unified a 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.590
 empire 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.499
 there are people here who say that 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.499
 messages to friends 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.890
 like the mentalists 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.670
 I know 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.650
 for example once he was separating 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.720
 a friend and I always told him that it rained 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:48.260
 stopped sometimes are messages for people who 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.149
 known 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.800
 they will grab some messages that 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.800
 see if you are attentive 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.270
 goes beyond his talent as a hairdresser 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.740
 and business success to Roberto Giordano 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.690
 he had to be grateful 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.910
 eternally for having given us to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.010
 all Argentinian thoughts 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.200
 memorable that decades later 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.270
 denounced we try yet 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.270
 unraveling does not hit me 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.899
 do not hit me or giordano put 7 now 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.640
 are you paying below the agreement 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.979
 collective work 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.860
 the four criteria discount 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.649
 this absolutely absolutely is not 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.399
 that I undoubtedly also want 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.920
 ask for my company is normally now 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.060
 the receipts and usually only if 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 normally it is undoubtedly 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.070
 are watching and analyzing why 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.410
 people take is that is a 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:01.230
 please enough they took it and they took 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:06.220
 just by trade the store posts 6 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:11.690
 doing it from the day taylor is 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.490
 just this mushroom this mushroom this mushroom 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 allow two were all in trials 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.370
 labor which of course is missing 12 but 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.680
 and again on a personal level like me 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.020
 president a company and that was the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.360
 inconvenient but after nothing else no 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.000
 absolutely not because 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.710
 economic problems but that the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.840
 risks that any businessman has 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.640
 it's a customer came to tell me I was 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.870
 It's wrong because the employee who had 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.290
 helped throughout life 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.660
 I made a terrible demand to see 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:49.350
 our five the carriages there is 10 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.640
 that super restore special and already happens 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.840
 the 32 already happens the 32 who wants to travel 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 in 32 a lot of people here in paris 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.590
 the metro the bus on the bus 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.090
 well let's go for more 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.330
 4 , provided that whenever it rained stopped 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.610
 it was cold and usually afterwards the 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:24.730
 Spring is already going to make the sun a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.090
 spectacular marithÃ© franÃ§ois son with 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.800
 an absolutely transgressive fashion 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.610
 different clothing superimposed clothes 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.120
 absolutely very special 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.120
 let's go to argentina 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:51.730
 to see if it has the center header 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.830
 absolutely free to make a goal there 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.830
 it's there it's good 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.629
 it's very important, well, you're 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.280
 opening the camera for both 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:12.430
 good as they are sharing is to throw 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.389
 you both want to tell him how much 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.470
 oxygen really takes away a car a 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:25.770
 combination of the car equals how many 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.770
 weapons are needed to avoid 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.900
 equally one on the mountain when you see 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.120
 really that there is no tree is that 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.500
 there is no oxygen means that it is missing 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.540
 oxygen there is to the mountain that you 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.050
 you said on another occasion what happens 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.289
 how much is equivalent in the gases and there what 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.149
 that takes away oxygen 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.189
 compared to the number of trees that 

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:49.499
 would be needed to fight in the 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.270
 combustion of a car that is obsolete 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:53.669
 as they have more than 120 years that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.059
 it takes away oxygen we go to Argentina that 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.059
 It can 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.500
 but in the sea he had to subtitle 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.280
 the goal of the selection did not surrender 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.280
 I work all 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.300
 have been measured seems
