00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:07.200
 sic stick again I said it's pretty simple 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:16.830
 with the screwdriver between the two 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:22.580

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.920
 There is a place on the chest 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.109
 after cleaning even with some 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.150
 parts that in here around being 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.450

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:54.539
 that there is one more problem that we 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.750
 spend money taking the mechanic 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.970

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.819
