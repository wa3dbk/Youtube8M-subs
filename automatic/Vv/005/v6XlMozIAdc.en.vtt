00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
okay so today is Sunday the 17th

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.190 
okay so today is Sunday the 17th
yesterday<00:00:04.470> after<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:04.830> pressed<00:00:05.580> in<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.200> bearing

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
yesterday after I pressed in the bearing

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.220 
yesterday after I pressed in the bearing
into<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.470> knuckle<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.189> then<00:00:08.450> it<00:00:09.450> was<00:00:09.630> the

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
into this knuckle and then it was the

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.560 
into this knuckle and then it was the
hub<00:00:11.030> into<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> bearing<00:00:12.740> I<00:00:13.740> kind<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.670> closed<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
hub into the bearing I kind of closed it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.910 
hub into the bearing I kind of closed it
up<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.839> day<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> actually<00:00:16.320> took<00:00:16.619> ended

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
up for the day that actually took ended

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.310 
up for the day that actually took ended
up<00:00:17.010> taking<00:00:17.250> about<00:00:17.490> two<00:00:18.300> hours<00:00:18.630> because<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
up taking about two hours because as I

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.950 
up taking about two hours because as I
said<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.560> screwed<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.400> time

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
said I screwed up the first time

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.500 
said I screwed up the first time
pressing<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.670> bearing<00:00:23.670> into<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> knuckle

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
pressing the bearing into the knuckle

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870 
pressing the bearing into the knuckle
and<00:00:24.689> chewed<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.650> inside<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.730> had

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and chewed up the inside and then I had

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.620 
and chewed up the inside and then I had
to<00:00:26.939> take<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.210> out

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
to take it out

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.759 
to take it out
stand<00:00:28.619> off<00:00:29.150> my<00:00:30.150> wear<00:00:30.330> head<00:00:30.650> created<00:00:31.650> some

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
stand off my wear head created some

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580 
stand off my wear head created some
shavings<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.430> actually<00:00:33.210> created<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.600> line

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
shavings and actually created a line

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760 
shavings and actually created a line
gouge<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.930> inside<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.230> knuckle

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
gouge in the inside of this knuckle

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
gouge in the inside of this knuckle
sanded<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.730> flat<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.629> tried<00:00:39.809> again

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
sanded that flat and then I tried again

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.020 
sanded that flat and then I tried again
I<00:00:40.260> screwed<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.590> again<00:00:40.680> had<00:00:41.070> even<00:00:41.610> worse<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
I screwed up again had even worse that

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.000 
I screwed up again had even worse that
time<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.480> send<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.350> off<00:00:43.469> again<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.890> then

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
time I send it off again and then

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
time I send it off again and then
finally<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.760> third<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> all<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
finally the third time I got it all the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.410 
finally the third time I got it all the
way<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> found<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.789> after<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> took<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
way in and I found out after I took that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
way in and I found out after I took that
last<00:00:48.570> video<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.559> had<00:00:49.890> created

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
last video that I actually had created

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.830 
last video that I actually had created
more<00:00:50.610> shavings<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> hadn't<00:00:51.510> gone<00:00:51.690> in

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
more shavings and it hadn't gone in

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
more shavings and it hadn't gone in
perfectly<00:00:52.230> straight<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> say

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
perfectly straight so all that to say

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.880 
perfectly straight so all that to say
that<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.710> might<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> take<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> shop

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that you might want to take it to a shop

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.020 
that you might want to take it to a shop
even<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.399> arbor<00:00:59.670> press<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:02.030> I'll

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
even if you have an arbor press and I'll

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
even if you have an arbor press and I'll
get<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> done<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.539> someone<00:01:03.809> he's<00:01:04.019> done<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
get it done by someone he's done it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.750 
get it done by someone he's done it
enough<00:01:04.650> times<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:05.129> exactly<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.640> they're

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
enough times know exactly what they're

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.160 
enough times know exactly what they're
doing<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.000> even<00:01:06.420> after<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.659> had<00:01:06.930> done<00:01:07.080> it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
doing because even after I had done it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
doing because even after I had done it
right<00:01:07.380> once<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> past<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:09.570> still<00:01:11.060> screwed

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
right once in the past I still screwed

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 
right once in the past I still screwed
up<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.490> every<00:01:14.490> times<00:01:14.700> even<00:01:15.000> though<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> knew

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
up and every times even though I knew

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.380 
up and every times even though I knew
how<00:01:15.420> careful<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> had<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
how careful I had to be so when I was

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
how careful I had to be so when I was
showing<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.750> bolts<00:01:19.110> for<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.430> bold

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
showing you this bolts for and this bold

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.350 
showing you this bolts for and this bold
is<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.689> clean<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
is because I say to this clean with this

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
is because I say to this clean with this
wire<00:01:24.360> brushing<00:01:24.840> into<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> dremel<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
wire brushing into the dremel so that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
wire brushing into the dremel so that
when<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.659> put<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> screws<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:29.509> as<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.900> read<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
when I put the screws on as I read this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
when I put the screws on as I read this
on<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.850> friction<00:01:33.299> inside<00:01:34.079> between

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
on there the friction inside between

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
on there the friction inside between
this<00:01:34.740> nut<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.850> bowl<00:01:36.180> hopefully<00:01:37.110> won't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
this nut and that bowl hopefully won't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
this nut and that bowl hopefully won't
be<00:01:37.320> enough<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> cause<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.159> spin<00:01:38.460> because

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
be enough to cause this to spin because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.770 
be enough to cause this to spin because
this<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.420> spin<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.780> anyway

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this thing will actually spin so anyway

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.850 
this thing will actually spin so anyway
when<00:01:45.899> I'm<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.049> once<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.680> there

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
when I'm like once I get it on there

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069 
when I'm like once I get it on there
there's<00:01:47.040> no<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.689> prevent<00:01:48.689> those<00:01:48.899> two

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
there's no way to prevent those two

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
there's no way to prevent those two
things<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.380> spinning<00:01:49.710> unless<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.790> low

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
things from spinning unless there's low

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
things from spinning unless there's low
enough<00:01:51.270> friction<00:01:51.630> between<00:01:51.750> these<00:01:52.020> pieces<00:01:52.470> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
enough friction between these pieces I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.649 
enough friction between these pieces I
don't<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.880> why<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.119> designed<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.630> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
don't know why they designed that I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
don't know why they designed that I
think<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.990> mentioned<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.560> earlier<00:01:56.100> video

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
think I mentioned this in earlier video

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.609 
think I mentioned this in earlier video
but<00:01:56.579> anyway

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
but anyway

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.190 
but anyway
it<00:01:58.490> is<00:01:58.640> what<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.880> is<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.240> also<00:01:59.479> try<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.810> clean<00:02:00.079> out

desolates collecting yesterday even gets

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.040 
desolates collecting yesterday even gets
played<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.849> lot<00:02:23.030> already<00:02:23.209> uh<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:25.519> know<00:02:25.610> won't

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.140 
played a lot already uh you know won't
degrade<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.349> quality<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.769> brakes<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
degrade the quality of the brakes that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.559 
degrade the quality of the brakes that
should<00:02:29.810> take<00:02:29.959> me<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.500> couple<00:02:30.830> hours<00:02:31.459> maybe<00:02:31.819> at

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
should take me a couple hours maybe at

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.180 
should take me a couple hours maybe at
worst<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:35.090> that'll<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.530> done<00:02:36.530> put<00:02:37.160> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
worst and then that'll be done put the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.000 
worst and then that'll be done put the
lug<00:02:37.459> nuts<00:02:37.640> back<00:02:37.850> on<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.420> wheel<00:02:38.569> back<00:02:38.810> on

lug nuts back on and the wheel back on

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.960 
lug nuts back on and the wheel back on
well<00:02:40.010> also<00:02:40.160> don't<00:02:40.519> forget<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.830> cotter<00:02:43.280> pins<00:02:43.610> I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
well also don't forget the cotter pins I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.660 
well also don't forget the cotter pins I
have<00:02:44.480> new<00:02:45.349> ones<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.799> replace<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.340> old<00:02:46.459> ones

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
actually I found out mine or two

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.600 
actually I found out mine or two
different<00:02:48.950> sizes<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:52.310> know<00:02:52.430> if<00:02:52.519> you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
different sizes and I you know if you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.370 
different sizes and I you know if you
can't<00:02:52.880> find<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.330> right<00:02:53.420> ones<00:02:53.660> you<00:02:54.140> know<00:02:54.230> your

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
can't find the right ones you know your

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.759 
can't find the right ones you know your
old<00:02:54.470> one<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> might<00:02:55.099> still<00:02:55.519> be<00:02:55.640> okay<00:02:56.769> like

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
old one this might still be okay like

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.890 
old one this might still be okay like
for<00:02:57.799> example<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.549> one<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:59.510> still<00:02:59.720> actually

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
for example this one I'm still actually

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.270 
for example this one I'm still actually
fine<00:03:00.349> it's<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.680> heat<00:03:01.190> up<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.489> bit<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> anyway

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
fine it's just heat up a bit so anyway

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.210 
fine it's just heat up a bit so anyway
as<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.430> see<00:03:04.609> fit<00:03:05.650> maybe<00:03:06.650> I'll<00:03:06.799> take<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> picture

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
as you see fit maybe I'll take a picture

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.780 
as you see fit maybe I'll take a picture
or<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.000> shot<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:09.019> he's<00:03:09.140> all<00:03:09.380> done<00:03:09.650> but<00:03:09.920> probably

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
or a shot and he's all done but probably

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.190 
or a shot and he's all done but probably
guys<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.090> won't<00:03:11.239> need<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.720> because<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.140> is

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
guys you won't need that because this is

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.300 
guys you won't need that because this is
the<00:03:12.320> easy<00:03:12.470> part<00:03:12.590> getting<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:13.040> back<00:03:13.130> together

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
the easy part getting it back together

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.910 
the easy part getting it back together
so<00:03:14.140> hopefully<00:03:15.140> you've<00:03:15.350> gotten<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.680> far

try<00:03:23.090> them<00:03:23.170> posted<00:03:24.170> somehow<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.250> take<00:03:25.430> another

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
try them posted somehow you take another

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.509 
try them posted somehow you take another
video<00:03:25.910> but<00:03:26.560> she'll<00:03:27.560> be<00:03:27.590> good<00:03:27.829> first<00:03:28.220> I'll<00:03:28.340> take

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
video but she'll be good first I'll take

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.759 
video but she'll be good first I'll take
off<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.819> stringing<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.660> hope<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.049> I<00:03:30.530> might

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
off the stringing and hope that I might

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.300 
off the stringing and hope that I might
know<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:32.290> lower<00:03:33.290> down<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.680> drive<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.130> see

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
know to lower down and drive it and see

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.099 
know to lower down and drive it and see
if<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.519> fix<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:35.030> problem<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:36.549> hope<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.730> helped

if I fix the problem I hope it helped

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.830 
if I fix the problem I hope it helped
right<00:03:39.459> over<00:03:40.459> detail<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.540> camera

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
right over detail and that camera

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.410
