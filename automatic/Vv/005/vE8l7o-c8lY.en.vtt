it up with these two stands at the same
time<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.119> I<00:01:14.179> would<00:01:14.360> never<00:01:14.569> do<00:01:14.840> one<00:01:15.170> stand<00:01:15.560> at<00:01:15.770> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
time and I would never do one stand at a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.650 
time and I would never do one stand at a
time<00:01:16.069> because<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.490> boat<00:01:16.729> could<00:01:16.910> slide<00:01:17.360> off

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
time because the boat could slide off

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.180 
time because the boat could slide off
the<00:01:17.690> stands<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.440> that's<00:01:18.619> happened<00:01:19.009> recently

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
the stands and that's happened recently

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.400 
the stands and that's happened recently
in<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.700> boat<00:01:19.880> yard<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.420> we're<00:01:20.990> going<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.140> try<00:01:21.349> to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
in a boat yard so we're going to try to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.740 
in a boat yard so we're going to try to
do<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.679> as<00:01:21.800> safely<00:01:22.099> as<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:22.459> can<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.910> as<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.479> push

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
it up I'm going to be actually building

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
it up I'm going to be actually building
a<00:01:25.929> some<00:01:26.929> blocking<00:01:27.530> underneath<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.149> strut

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
a some blocking underneath the strut

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.589 
a some blocking underneath the strut
just<00:01:30.319> forward<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.979> prop<00:01:31.310> here<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:32.149> support

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
just forward of the prop here to support

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.540 
just forward of the prop here to support
it<00:01:32.750> for<00:01:32.929> safety<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:33.619> we're<00:01:33.920> actually<00:01:34.160> going

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
it for safety and we're actually going

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.219 
it for safety and we're actually going
to<00:01:34.640> let<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:35.060> weight<00:01:35.209> down<00:01:35.479> on<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:35.959> set<00:01:36.200> of

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
to let the weight down on that set of

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469 
to let the weight down on that set of
blocks<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.860> just<00:01:36.950> have<00:01:37.280> these<00:01:37.459> be<00:01:37.759> stability

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479

area some of these boats if you move
down<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.910> little<00:01:50.209> bit<00:01:50.390> forward<00:01:50.899> they're<00:01:51.020> going

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
down a little bit forward they're going

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.540 
down a little bit forward they're going
to<00:01:51.200> be<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.319> little<00:01:51.470> punky<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.069> wouldn't<00:01:52.340> want<00:01:52.459> to

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
to be a little punky we wouldn't want to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.249 
to be a little punky we wouldn't want to
push<00:01:52.729> on<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.539> we're<00:01:53.660> pushing<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.110> it

push on it there so we're pushing on it

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.800 
push on it there so we're pushing on it
at<00:01:54.500> its<00:01:54.800> strongest<00:01:55.130> position<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.209> we're

at its strongest position and we're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.089 
at its strongest position and we're
going<00:01:56.989> to<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.349> up<00:01:57.500> some<00:01:57.739> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:57.979> we're

going to get it up some and then we're

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.499 
going to get it up some and then we're
going<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.250> build<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.640> little<00:01:58.729> row<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.270> blocks

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509

going to build a little row of blocks
underneath<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.410> strut<00:02:00.739> there<00:02:00.950> for<00:02:01.190> safety<00:02:01.429> so

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
underneath the strut there for safety so

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.100 
underneath the strut there for safety so
let's<00:02:02.000> go<00:02:02.119> ahead<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.450> spin<00:02:02.690> it<00:02:02.810> right<00:02:02.929> up

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
let's go ahead and spin it right up

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.690 
let's go ahead and spin it right up
there<00:02:03.319> like<00:02:03.619> half<00:02:03.830> turns<00:02:04.160> at<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.489> time<00:02:04.729> you<00:02:05.000> know

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there like half turns at a time you know

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.930 
there like half turns at a time you know
right<00:02:07.400> half-half<00:02:08.479> going<00:02:10.550> jacked<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.790> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
right half-half going jacked it up a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
right half-half going jacked it up a
little<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.480> we've<00:02:12.630> got<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> little<00:02:13.050> bit

little bit then we've got a little bit

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.190 
little bit then we've got a little bit
more<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.530> go<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.010> we've<00:02:14.580> kept<00:02:14.880> up<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:16.050> with

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
I've got this jack fully extended I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.430 
I've got this jack fully extended I
placed<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.270> jack<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> other<00:03:27.930> side<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
placed the jack on the other side of the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.200 
placed the jack on the other side of the
crossmember<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> little<00:03:29.460> bit<00:03:29.640> higher<00:03:29.820> block

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
crossmember on a little bit higher block

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.660 
crossmember on a little bit higher block
so<00:03:30.480> we'd<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.810> some<00:03:31.080> reserved<00:03:31.770> cylinder<00:03:32.430> left

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
so we'd have some reserved cylinder left

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.130 
so we'd have some reserved cylinder left
if<00:03:32.820> we<00:03:32.940> want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.240> go<00:03:33.360> up<00:03:33.450> any<00:03:33.630> higher

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
if we want to go up any higher

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.350 
if we want to go up any higher
and<00:03:34.230> now<00:03:34.830> I've<00:03:35.010> jacked<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.700> up<00:03:35.820> until<00:03:36.030> I've<00:03:36.180> got

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
and now I've jacked it up until I've got

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.840 
and now I've jacked it up until I've got
the<00:03:36.510> weight<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:36.990> jack<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.550> remove

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
the weight on that jack now I can remove

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.800 
the weight on that jack now I can remove
this<00:03:39.180> jack

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
this jack

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.550 
this jack
and<00:03:40.040> move<00:03:41.040> now<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:42.360> have<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.020> truck<00:03:43.260> driver

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
and move now is to have the truck driver

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
and move now is to have the truck driver
pull<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.010> trailer<00:03:44.490> up<00:03:44.820> until<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:46.290> first<00:03:46.709> axle

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
pull the trailer up until the first axle

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.490 
pull the trailer up until the first axle
comes<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> jack<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.110> we're<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.410> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
comes up to the jack and we're going to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800 
comes up to the jack and we're going to
stop<00:03:49.739> right<00:03:50.040> there<00:03:50.070> before<00:03:50.850> we<00:03:51.270> started<00:03:51.660> this

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
stop right there before we started this

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.870 
stop right there before we started this
operation<00:03:52.020> we<00:03:52.620> backed<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.160> truck<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
operation we backed the truck and the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.150 
operation we backed the truck and the
trailer<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.510> quite<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> bit<00:03:55.200> further<00:03:55.440> aft<00:03:55.830> than

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
trailer up quite a bit further aft than

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.550 
trailer up quite a bit further aft than
this<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.760> then<00:03:56.910> pulled<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.390> forward<00:03:57.840> nice<00:03:58.170> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
this and then pulled it forward nice and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.530 
this and then pulled it forward nice and
straight<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.610> wheels<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.120> truck<00:04:00.360> are

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
straight and the wheels of the truck are

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.970 
straight and the wheels of the truck are
nice<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:00.930> straight<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.500> trailer<00:04:01.770> and

the truck are straight with each other

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.660 
the truck are straight with each other
so<00:04:03.660> that<00:04:03.840> as<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.170> pull<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.560> out<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:05.250> won't<00:04:05.459> have

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
so that as we pull it out we won't have

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.810 
so that as we pull it out we won't have
like<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.840> little<00:04:07.310> bear<00:04:08.310> right<00:04:08.760> here

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
like this little bear right here

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.210 
like this little bear right here
encroaching<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> keel<00:04:10.230> or<00:04:10.260> rubbing<00:04:11.070> in

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
encroaching on the keel or rubbing in

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.160 
encroaching on the keel or rubbing in
any<00:04:11.400> way<00:04:11.700> we<00:04:11.910> have<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.150> be<00:04:12.270> very<00:04:12.510> careful<00:04:12.989> now

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
any way we have to be very careful now

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.110 
any way we have to be very careful now
as<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:13.530> pull<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.860> truck<00:04:14.100> forward<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:15.030> we

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
as we pull the truck forward that we

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.509 
as we pull the truck forward that we
don't<00:04:15.300> go<00:04:15.450> too<00:04:15.510> far<00:04:15.959> or<00:04:16.410> we<00:04:16.859> don't<00:04:17.010> go<00:04:17.190> sideways

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
don't go too far or we don't go sideways

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.890 
don't go too far or we don't go sideways
or<00:04:17.940> anything<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.419> going<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.840> be

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
or anything like that going to be

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.479 
or anything like that going to be
watching<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.350> boat<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:19.739> carefully<00:04:20.250> it's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
watching the boat very carefully it's

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.090 
watching the boat very carefully it's
time<00:04:20.790> we<00:04:21.030> move<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.510> truck<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.959> trailer<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.890> go

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
time we move the truck and trailer we go

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.010 
time we move the truck and trailer we go
back<00:04:23.370> around<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.120> look<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.390> all<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.720> stands

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
back around and look at all the stands

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.750 
back around and look at all the stands
and<00:04:25.380> blocks<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.010> different<00:04:26.280> things<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> make

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
and blocks and different things to make

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.010 
and blocks and different things to make
sure<00:04:26.910> they're<00:04:27.120> all<00:04:27.150> sharing<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> load

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
sure they're all sharing the load

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.170 
sure they're all sharing the load
properly<00:04:28.710> alright<00:04:29.640> we're<00:04:29.820> being<00:04:30.030> very

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
properly alright we're being very

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.719 
properly alright we're being very
careful<00:04:30.479> back<00:04:30.930> after<00:04:31.500> as<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:31.950> Jack<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.520> bow

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
careful back after as we Jack the bow

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.810 
careful back after as we Jack the bow
into<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.419> boat<00:04:33.660> up<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.100> weight<00:04:35.370> doesn't

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
into the boat up that the weight doesn't

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.850 
into the boat up that the weight doesn't
get<00:04:35.970> transferred<00:04:36.540> too<00:04:36.810> much<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.410> stands

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
get transferred too much to the stands

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.350 
get transferred too much to the stands
because<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.280> blockin<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> little<00:04:39.210> bit

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
because the blockin is a little bit

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.270 
because the blockin is a little bit
ahead<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> stand<00:04:40.169> so<00:04:40.440> as<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.710> Jack<00:04:41.100> the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
ahead of the stand so as you Jack the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.010 
ahead of the stand so as you Jack the
bow<00:04:41.460> end<00:04:41.729> up<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.060> gets<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.330> little<00:04:42.450> bit<00:04:42.750> tighter

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
bow end up it gets a little bit tighter

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.719 
bow end up it gets a little bit tighter
on<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.380> stand<00:04:43.680> then<00:04:43.890> we<00:04:43.979> just<00:04:44.190> come<00:04:44.400> back<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
on the stand then we just come back and

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.550 
on the stand then we just come back and
loosen<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.030> stands<00:04:45.479> up<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.720> little<00:04:45.900> bit<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
loosen the stands up a little bit and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.930 
loosen the stands up a little bit and
the<00:04:46.680> idea<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.280> keep<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.580> evenly

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
the idea is to keep it evenly

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.210 
the idea is to keep it evenly
distributed<00:04:48.720> on<00:04:48.900> these<00:04:49.169> three<00:04:49.530> points<00:04:49.560> right

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
distributed on these three points right

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.040 
distributed on these three points right
here<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.580> block<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.090> carrying<00:04:51.630> most<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
here the block and carrying most of the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.770 
here the block and carrying most of the
load<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:53.130> stands<00:04:53.610> for<00:04:53.669> stability<00:04:54.030> only

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
load and that stands for stability only

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.500 
load and that stands for stability only
we've<00:04:55.350> got<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> on<00:04:55.770> one<00:04:56.220> jack<00:04:56.640> up<00:04:56.940> forward<00:04:57.419> and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
we've got it on one jack up forward and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.120 
we've got it on one jack up forward and
it's<00:04:57.690> clear<00:04:58.050> of<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.260> trailer<00:04:58.560> I'm<00:04:58.800> looking
