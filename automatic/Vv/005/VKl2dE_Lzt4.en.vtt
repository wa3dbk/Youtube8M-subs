00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 sega it's played well by toby 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.640
 flood that saw the space available 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.170
 behind rené ranger and now he 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.599
 must their crazy rise back side 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 Montpellier is wrong he passed 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.570
 well 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.780
 rogers who had to support just before 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.780
 Earth 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.580
 in the case of the point 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.220
 to connect toronto related to the race 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.140
 who beat 4-2 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.490
 while that's true if we were 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.930
 favorable is all one wanders 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.390
 in space and operas the rangers 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.620
 who broke that first curtain that goes 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.940
 lead this test this beautiful adventure 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 of Montpellier with a nice try 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.740
 winger for lucas dupont with a 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.720
 defensive climb a little bit too much 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.190
 rough side east side Toulouse 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.470
 even though it seems to me that they have a 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.560
 little maybe forward on the pass 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.850
 then a little en bloc especially sweat 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.510
 on patricio albacete 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.130
 if we can see him again just before 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.020
 case is good to negotiate then it's 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.600
 passes after contact and the tip of 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.979
 speed and play did not succeed in the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.229
 catch up he had a little bit of 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.040
 delay early 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.720
 look at everything left before the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.250
 rangers here we row them to bet on 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.190
 the capacity on the left that was 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 slowed down by the yes there was a kind of 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.250
 block 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.400
 yeah to the touch it's pretty funny 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.440
 that's good rape war he's at 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.970
 the shelter and the public and wayne rooney in 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.990
 time skipper bottles jets 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.120
 hoping to Montpellier which is good with 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.350
 the sleeve at the half time project 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.690
 who knows then we were lacking 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.220
 light that really has mind because 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.660
 that he had just cashed a death all 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.160
 try against all the same caution 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.470
 be careful because in life go out 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.470
 the book should not there because acute and geese 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.560
 google energy to play 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.280
 to double the stake after Benoît 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.770
 paillaugue following the net 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.780
 in the hall lucas of the body that comes 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.050
 lunch straw height because 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.630
 this essay 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.060
 these employees 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.079
 Toulouse time to listen 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.790
 this is jean marc doussain who is 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.879
 actually take on the closed side to stay 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.189
 closed side jean marc doussain and benoît 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.720
 paillaugue with his hi hi hi the tackle 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.470
 of his experience is well grasp 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.299
 opportunity 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.200
 it's yoann huget the acquired and away on 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.530
 plating that's not normal it's not 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.569
 normal 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.650
 what a disaster far from the gila the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.200
 plating and then that's the test and it's 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.110
 for montpellier 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.090
 pebbles or he will blame 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.830
 international winger of us at all and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 yeah montpellier that mark and 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.769
 montpellier who plays his luck in 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.790
 this match and montpellier which is in the process 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.340
 to eliminate the Toulouse stadium 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 right now we're playing his 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.130
 luck because we said there's more 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.200
 nothing to gain in the european cup 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.950
 it's safe for montpellier but 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.349
 montpellier had made this match a 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.190
 match test in sight obviously of the 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.560
 next exit 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.390
 it will be bordeaux in the top 14 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.940
 and especially the mission of no longer 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.230
 lose at home for jack white and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.640
 well for now they are in the process of 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.880
 succeed their bet 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.980
 it will not miss that bin Mlouka 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.970
 overtakes by amandine roth 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.400
 I observed him follow him all is 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.300
 abbey people's party this departure in the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.430
 closed and damage to this error 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.280
 defensive of Toulouse but then 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.730
 especially we note the opportunism of 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.730
 Montpellier
