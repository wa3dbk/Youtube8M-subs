little<00:01:09.509> bit<00:01:09.689> longer

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
little bit longer

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.530 
little bit longer
and<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.820> anything<00:01:12.060> I'll<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.420> the

and if I don't get anything I'll go the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.899 
and if I don't get anything I'll go the
other<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> highway

to try a new spot let me show you what

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.980 
to try a new spot let me show you what
that<00:01:34.650> spots<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.190> once

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.110 

it's<00:01:38.680> in<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.070> area<00:01:39.340> I'm<00:01:39.580> gonna<00:01:39.730> start<00:01:39.910> working

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120

washed<00:01:48.130> away<00:01:48.370> a<00:01:48.850> lot<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.870> this<00:01:49.990> Bank<00:01:50.290> just<00:01:51.330> this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
washed away a lot of this Bank just this

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.270 
washed away a lot of this Bank just this
is<00:01:52.450> all<00:01:52.600> new<00:01:52.840> exposed<00:01:53.260> stuff<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.830> I'm<00:01:54.070> going<00:01:54.250> to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
is all new exposed stuff so I'm going to

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.060 
is all new exposed stuff so I'm going to
keep<00:01:54.490> working<00:01:54.880> all<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.930> see<00:01:56.920> what<00:01:56.979> I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
keep working all this and see what I

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.560 
keep working all this and see what I
come<00:01:57.220> up<00:01:57.280> with<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:57.910> been<00:01:58.090> producing<00:01:58.420> a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
come up with it's been producing a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.810 
come up with it's been producing a
little<00:01:58.750> code<00:01:58.900> for<00:01:59.110> me<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.380> far<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.640> this

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
little code for me so far and all this

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.580 
little code for me so far and all this
stuff<00:02:00.970> right<00:02:01.300> here<00:02:01.510> below<00:02:01.750> me<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.140> all<00:02:02.290> solid

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
stuff right here below me is all solid

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.460 
stuff right here below me is all solid
rock<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:04.630> I'm<00:02:04.810> gonna<00:02:04.930> work<00:02:05.170> right

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
rock so I think I'm gonna work right

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.500 
rock so I think I'm gonna work right
between<00:02:05.619> that<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:06.070> new<00:02:06.670> exposed<00:02:07.090> material<00:02:07.420> in

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
between that a new exposed material in

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.779 
between that a new exposed material in
that<00:02:07.540> bedrock<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.340> hopefully<00:02:09.340> come<00:02:09.490> up<00:02:09.550> with

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
that bedrock and hopefully come up with

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.940 
that bedrock and hopefully come up with
some<00:02:09.910> more<00:02:10.000> gold

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
some more gold

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.560 
some more gold
that's<00:02:11.950> my<00:02:12.130> shuttle<00:02:12.370> example<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.209> mature

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
that's my shuttle example so I mature

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's my shuttle example so I mature
I'm<00:02:13.690> working<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.260> there's<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.190> lot<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.430> this

dustman she's a goal to wrap around some

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.729 
dustman she's a goal to wrap around some
quartz<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:37.140> that's<00:03:38.140> why<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.260> ended<00:03:38.290> up<00:03:38.590> with

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
quartz so that's why I ended up with

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.240 
quartz so that's why I ended up with
today<00:03:38.950> in<00:03:39.459> 12<00:03:39.880> buckets<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.329> material

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
today in 12 buckets of material
