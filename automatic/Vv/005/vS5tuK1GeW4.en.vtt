00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
language arts we're going to also do cut

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.979 
language arts we're going to also do cut
paper<00:00:49.530> design<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.510> also<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
paper design and we're also going to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.520 
paper design and we're also going to
discover<00:00:52.439> the<00:00:53.539> notion<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> positive<00:00:55.409> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
discover the notion of positive and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
discover the notion of positive and
negative<00:00:55.859> space<00:00:55.979> in<00:00:56.430> art<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.659> let's<00:00:57.899> start

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
negative space in art so let's start

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.399 
negative space in art so let's start
with<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.530> positive<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.879> negative<00:01:00.269> space

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
with that positive and negative space

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.959 
with that positive and negative space
it's<00:01:01.409> kind<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.619> hard<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> describe<00:01:02.219> sometimes

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's kind of hard to describe sometimes

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.919 
it's kind of hard to describe sometimes
but<00:01:04.309> look<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.429> me<00:01:05.549> where<00:01:05.759> I'm<00:01:05.850> standing<00:01:06.090> you're

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
but look at me where I'm standing you're

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.380 
but look at me where I'm standing you're
seeing<00:01:07.259> me<00:01:07.409> aren't<00:01:07.679> you<00:01:07.799> okay<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.789> body<00:01:09.030> takes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
seeing me aren't you okay my body takes

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.840 
seeing me aren't you okay my body takes
up<00:01:09.569> space<00:01:09.710> okay<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> spot<00:01:11.640> where

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
up space okay but there's a spot where

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.109 
up space okay but there's a spot where
there<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.090> no<00:01:12.270> space<00:01:12.509> right<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.000> under<00:01:15.000> this

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
there is no space right here under this

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.080 
there is no space right here under this
arm<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:16.319> negative<00:01:16.830> space<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.759> let's<00:01:17.940> take

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
arm that's negative space so let's take

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.410 
arm that's negative space so let's take
a<00:01:18.119> look<00:01:18.330> at<00:01:18.569> a<00:01:18.630> couple<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> works<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.649> art<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
a look at a couple of works of art that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
a look at a couple of works of art that
show<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.690> negative<00:01:22.080> space<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:22.319> positive

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
show what negative space and positive

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.370 
show what negative space and positive
space<00:01:23.190> are<00:01:23.750> take<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> look<00:01:24.959> at<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.170> picture

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
space are take a look at this picture

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.539 
space are take a look at this picture

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
customer first of the open space of the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.390 
customer first of the open space of the
other<00:02:31.849> birds

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.309 

okay<00:02:38.400> Laura<00:02:38.700> has<00:02:38.879> noticed<00:02:39.360> debt<00:02:39.629> there<00:02:40.200> are

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
okay Laura has noticed debt there are

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.660 
okay Laura has noticed debt there are
green<00:02:40.530> birds<00:02:40.799> on<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.340> they're<00:02:41.489> also

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
green birds on here but they're also

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.420 
green birds on here but they're also
what<00:02:42.030> other<00:02:42.060> color<00:02:43.040> white<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.220> light<00:02:44.400> colored

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
what other color white or light colored

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.400 
what other color white or light colored
birds<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.600> say<00:02:45.780> look<00:02:45.990> at<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.200> green

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
birds so if I say look at the green

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
birds so if I say look at the green
birds<00:02:46.880> those<00:02:47.880> become<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
birds those become the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
birds those become the
positive<00:02:49.860> space<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.060> white<00:02:51.240> birds

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
positive space and the white birds

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.470 
positive space and the white birds
become<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.580> base<00:02:53.580> now<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> say<00:02:54.030> look<00:02:54.240> at<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
become the base now I say look at the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.860 
become the base now I say look at the
look<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.990> white<00:02:55.140> birds<00:02:56.390> what<00:02:57.390> happens<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
look at the white birds what happens to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.330 
look at the white birds what happens to
the<00:02:57.960> green<00:02:58.140> birds<00:02:59.450> they<00:03:00.450> become<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.340> negative

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the green birds they become the negative

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.590 
the green birds they become the negative
space<00:03:02.550> isn't<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:02.970> interesting

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
space isn't that interesting

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.470 
space isn't that interesting
so<00:03:03.930> positive<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.920> negative<00:03:05.280> space<00:03:05.480> one

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
so positive and negative space one

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.260 
so positive and negative space one
cannot<00:03:06.810> work<00:03:07.260> without<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.770> other<00:03:08.270> positive

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
cannot work without the other positive

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.510 
cannot work without the other positive
and<00:03:09.510> negative<00:03:09.840> space<00:03:09.960> together<00:03:10.620> create<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
and negative space together create the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.370 
and negative space together create the
image<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:12.000> we're<00:03:12.120> looking<00:03:12.210> for<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.230> have

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
image that we're looking for and I have

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.230

this<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.560> an<00:04:46.680> example<00:04:47.040> again<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.669> how<00:04:47.910> positive

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
this is an example again of how positive

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.890 
this is an example again of how positive
and<00:04:48.600> negative<00:04:48.930> space<00:04:49.020> works<00:04:50.060> today<00:04:51.060> using

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and negative space works today using

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.930
