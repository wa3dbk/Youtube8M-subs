00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.550 
was designed for a smaller screen a zoom
control<00:05:44.930> will<00:05:45.169> appear<00:05:45.680> by<00:05:46.189> the<00:05:46.249> clock<00:05:47.560> so

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
control will appear by the clock so

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.230 
control will appear by the clock so
that's<00:05:48.949> gonna<00:05:49.189> be<00:05:49.430> that<00:05:49.610> little<00:05:49.939> thing<00:05:50.210> right

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
that's gonna be that little thing right

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.219 
that's gonna be that little thing right
there<00:05:50.719> we<00:05:51.710> can<00:05:51.949> stretch<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.430> fill<00:05:53.050> so<00:05:54.050> that's

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
there we can stretch to fill so that's

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.640 
there we can stretch to fill so that's
pretty<00:05:54.529> cool<00:05:54.770> addition<00:05:55.750> you<00:05:56.750> just<00:05:57.020> go<00:05:57.229> home

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.889 

that's<00:06:00.650> okay

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:01.899 
that's okay

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:07.269 
that's okay
but<00:06:02.899> other<00:06:03.229> than<00:06:03.259> that<00:06:04.960> haven't<00:06:06.279> particularly

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
but other than that haven't particularly

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.950 
but other than that haven't particularly
noticed<00:06:07.819> anything<00:06:08.319> unusual<00:06:09.879> or<00:06:10.960> deeply

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
noticed anything unusual or deeply

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.769 
noticed anything unusual or deeply
sensitive<00:06:12.649> or<00:06:14.259> mysterious<00:06:15.259> things<00:06:16.069> like<00:06:16.250> that

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:16.779 
sensitive or mysterious things like that

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.459 
sensitive or mysterious things like that

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
again it's pretty fairly smooth we're

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.559 
again it's pretty fairly smooth we're
gonna<00:06:21.710> see<00:06:21.949> an<00:06:22.039> update<00:06:22.430> here<00:06:23.500> so<00:06:25.000> we<00:06:26.000> can<00:06:26.240> clear
