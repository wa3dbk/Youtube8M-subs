00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
players so if you're a fan of the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
players so if you're a fan of the
women's<00:01:43.500> game<00:01:43.680> you're<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.220> luck<00:01:44.579> also

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
women's game you're out of luck also

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.210 
women's game you're out of luck also
there<00:01:45.630> isn't<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> game<00:01:46.200> save<00:01:46.439> option<00:01:46.950> which

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
there isn't a game save option which

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
there isn't a game save option which
should<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> mandatory<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.360> mobile<00:01:48.780> games

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
should be mandatory for mobile games

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.569
