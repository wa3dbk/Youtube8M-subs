00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello very good youtube crazy 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.600
 welcome in a boxing that the truth 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.580
 pretty special for us 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.070
 first of all I wanted to say that no 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.019
 we have thought the maximum of guys but 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.870
 the truth many you put in the video 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.580
 yesterday if I remember correctly wrong in which 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.320
 explained a little what is the demo of 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.630
 armero land the new game 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.180
 wyatt main that came out on the 22nd here in 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.610
 Spain but officially adapted 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.200
 worth a day before bringing it here and 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.300
 we have it as you see we are not going to do it 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.520
 because it's the is the typical game for the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.840
 little box we have not caught any 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.370
 collector's edition or anything by the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.410
 style since the chapel edition goes 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.260
 hundred euros and the truth that a diego that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.120
 I brought beteta flexion 1 because it's in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.829
 this saga as you know, our 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.630
 great friend marcus that comes from garbage 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.910
 of the coolest perfect editions 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.460
 that we have the boys also tell you 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.100
 that the channel is going to have a gameplay voucher 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.079
 of this game tried to do things 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.430
 enough guys are going to like and good 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.350
 let's proceed to a boxing like 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.360
 we always say like and favored like 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.070
 nothing to be attentive to the channel these 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.900
 People, because they were carrying news 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.530
 very important in itself that we go to the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.330
 boxing 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.250
 Well guys, here we are going to see what 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.979
 that having a boxing like I said no 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.409
 it's nothing special is the game like 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.690
 we always say work in boxing was 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.490
 nothing since while I'm talking about 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.130
 tasks to go watching images of the video 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.600
 that we went up in case you have not seen 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.180
 but you have the channel worth serving 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.430
 we went up yesterday and where we show more or 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.070
 less what is the game is worth more 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.530
 forward then it will consist of salary 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.049
 Of course it is the multiplayer of 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.430
 game is worth something campaign mode but 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.539
 I always want to leave the little surprises 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.970
 let's see the game no way again 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.850
 as we always say guys as you see 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.800
 Here we made the slate read and included 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 a digital copy for energy software 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.700
 1 is worth what we can exchange in our 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 xbox and be able to have one as you see nothing 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.280
 from the other world very simple 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.659
 and promoting them to wyatt men as 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.869
 you know the protagonist of this delivery 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.969
 is bert in rubiales and then yes 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.390

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.750

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.810
 box light and two trial periods 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.400
 software 1 as you see is disk nothing of the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.069
 another world guys a box and very very 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.349
 simple, you did not tell him that 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.880
 we did it without anything here you already have 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.709
 be alert to the channel soon 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.349
 because there may be news about this 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.880
 game and we have thought about some videos 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.099
 guys that you're going to like a lot like that 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.840
 we said goodbye to marcus though 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.079
 we have the dlc to play with marcus 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.700

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.510
