00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.890
 the gerbera is characterized by leaves of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.040
 different shape arranged in rosettes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 colored flower heads whose tones vary between 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.980
 yellow, crimson and purples yes 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.720
 it is a particularly plant 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 suitable for the production of flowers from 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 chop off 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.740
 the latter in fact are numerous on 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.430
 each solitary plant with orange tones 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.430
 scarlet 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.030
 even if there is no lack of varieties and hybrids a 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.820
 double flowers with more delicate colors 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 8 to 12 cm long bloom from 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.330
 May to August 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.649
 light drinking can be grown 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.500
 outdoors in all climate regions 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.509
 mild in colder regions such as 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.130
 in northern Italy it will be 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.079
 sufficient even in winter a 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.109
 protect them with a layer of leaves 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.109
 shallows 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.550
 read drinking can be planted in 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.250
 all garden soils as long as well 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.410
 drained and in the sun choosing the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.820
 placement better to address up 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.820
 more sheltered positions 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.520
 as regards instead the 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.810
 pot cultivation 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.540
 the plants at the beginning of autumn 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.120
 they must be transported to a room 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.520
 well lit in which the temperature 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.520
 do not drop below about 5 degrees 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.800
 if you want to get winter blooms 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.230
 from your gerbera stop 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.420
 water it starting in May 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.660
 it thus forces the network to go into rest 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 during the summer and once fertilized it is 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.280
 abundantly watered in September 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.050
 you will stimulate the vegetative restart in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.050
 time for the coldest season
