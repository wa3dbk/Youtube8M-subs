their<00:02:27.590> own<00:02:27.880> motivation<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.000> give<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> hundred

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
their own motivation to give a hundred

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.170 
their own motivation to give a hundred
percent<00:02:29.690> in<00:02:30.230> training<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.740> practice<00:02:31.220> because

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
percent in training and practice because

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.050 
percent in training and practice because
ultimately<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:33.170> got<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:34.070> come<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.430> within

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
ultimately it's got to come from within

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.220 
ultimately it's got to come from within
them<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:36.170> from<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.660> now<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.870> really

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
them and not from you now if you really

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.530 
them and not from you now if you really
think<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.860> your<00:02:40.010> child<00:02:40.280> responds<00:02:40.790> better<00:02:41.209> to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
think that your child responds better to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.250 
think that your child responds better to
the<00:02:41.690> pushing<00:02:42.290> then<00:02:43.280> ask<00:02:43.640> them<00:02:44.180> how<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.840> when

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
the pushing then ask them how and when

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.350 
the pushing then ask them how and when
it<00:02:45.560> would<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.709> appropriate<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.489> support<00:02:47.120> them

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
it would be appropriate to support them

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.650 
it would be appropriate to support them
that<00:02:47.600> way<00:02:48.130> if<00:02:49.130> you're<00:02:49.400> pushing<00:02:49.700> them<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.209> they

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
that way if you're pushing them and they

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.320 
that way if you're pushing them and they
don't<00:02:50.900> want<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.410> then<00:02:51.739> it's<00:02:51.950> your<00:02:52.340> goal<00:02:52.610> not

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
don't want it then it's your goal not

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.960 
don't want it then it's your goal not
