 then we fishermen 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.239

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.239
 they communicated something 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.769

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.480

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.690
 Perimeter sector of the so-called city

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.950
 of its inhabitants become 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.530
 heroes to survive in the middle of the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.420
 misery we are the poor agatha submitted 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.290

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.990
 dirty living from fishing there are times of 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.869
 that we win sometimes we do not win and 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.980

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
 of the 33 leaders who attend this 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
