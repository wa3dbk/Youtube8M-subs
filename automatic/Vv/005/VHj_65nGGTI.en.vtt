00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:22.540
 We are working hard and well and 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.760
 accumulating load for the start that does not 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.020
 we have within a month and days so 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.020
 good trying to prepare well 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.110
 now now yes, I had it clear 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.130
 since the last match in camp nou 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.649
 it was nothing nothing difficult happens that everything 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.350
 he has his time and everything has his way and 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.710
 you have to do it well so good the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 decision was unanimous of all from 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 since the last game 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.640
 well, the last six months that I spent 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.980
 I think they were very good we got 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 the goal the wardrobe the people in 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.390
 six months I was able to make friends and I think 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.680
 that both my family and myself 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 Well, we are happy to be here 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 ah 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 company 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.130
 if we are waiting for all we are all 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 waiting for them to arrive 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 new players 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.119
 to make the template more competitive 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 more prepared for the first game of 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.920
 league that we have it seems that no but 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 but close and good we are all 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.940
 waiting for colleagues to arrive 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.190
 well what I tell you not to have more 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.040
 competition up in positions where 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.500
 all players are missing at the end 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 will add to be able to yield more to be able 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 make goals to be able to make a game 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.399
 more beautiful try to improve and I think that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 the club I think is doing the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.070
 great efforts to stop 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.070
 have a competitive template 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.190
 what number 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.020
 I do not know 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
 depends on which equipment teams that 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.020
 I was with four forwards and forests 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 that we've been three teams that we've 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
 been two everything depends on how it 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.630
 Play the system what you need the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.270
 team of varieties you may have 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.220
 of players who may occupy several 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.720
 positions managers from here that already 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 we have a template and they only go 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.660
 to come where it can occupy many of the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.030
 offensive positions and good will vary a 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 little bit of all that not at the end at the end and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.270
 Finally, the important thing is to make a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.660
 competitive template to be able 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.720
 front facing 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.790
 the requirement of that championship 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.020
 from the first day until the last of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.400
 try to meet the objectives better than 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.950
 in which last year he will try 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.250
 try to improve that permanence so 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.380
 suffered and in the end then we who are 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.520
 we will fight to the end going all 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.520
 for the same road 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.670
 it was very hard the negotiation did not 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.010
 He thought of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.140
 leaving 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.819
 what I've seen in summer is that 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.319
 you only know more things that you 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.470
 me so 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.540
 I have nothing to say why 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.640
 for it said there were people who knew more 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.610
 that I 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.940
 the negotiation was very good very cordial 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.120
 it was from him I've already said the last 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.810
 League match the decision to follow 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.610
 was unanimous for all and all that form 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.440
 part of football there is no need to 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.400
 negotiate with him with the wigan that was not 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.670
 nothing easy to me was very very complicated and 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.130
 that's why it took much more, but 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.130
 Well I said that everything was very good 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.610
 ah 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.950
 much 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.290
 well we had to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.090
 and negotiate things yes but good the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.340
 my family's decision and mine was to be 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.100
 here was to be in the Spanish league and 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.190
 be a place where I was very 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.720
 happy the last six months and sometimes 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.840
 you have to do things to be able to be 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.840
 here 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.760
 and with the desire 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.840
 well sometimes sometimes it does not depend on 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.270
 One in Pamplona also wanted to sit down 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.000
 and being there for many years and did not depend on 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.430
 me and I had to leave and good to 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.680
 final does not depend on one the one what 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.990
 can do is work hard to be 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 a maximum years possible on site 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.099
 where it is not where you want it where you have 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.840
 respected where where happy and to 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.150
 end that is what we all wish 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.750
 I have many years to follow 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.750
 being happy here 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:22.169
 of is 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.249
 but if you ask me the same good 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.039
 a mixture with such a little 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.309
 Well that is that I'm going to answer you 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.309
 same 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.180
 good 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.130
 yes 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:49.779
 but he is blamed for good if I 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.120
 I will always say the same thing that I am going to 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:55.389
 work very hard to try to improve 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.770
 to try to make things better for 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.990
 try to score many goals to give 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.210
 many points to the team and work is not going 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.830
 to never miss that is what is the most 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.229
 important, if you have that, you play 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.520
 well do your classmates good 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.889
 try the game at the end the goals 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.659
 always arrive if they are going to be and is 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.520
 what I have done in recent years I do not have 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:14.919
 20 years and I already know how this works and 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.839
 to score goals and to cheer the 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.449
 team you have to work hard and that's 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:22.229
 what we have to do myself and the others 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.229
 front who are here 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.050
 and 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.120
 thank you it may be possible to make a 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.689
 quiet stay 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.889
 what 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.889
 and in the end only 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.060
 that is going to suffer and that will have to 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.030
 fight to the end do not doubt 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.289
 we are in the best league in the world 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.360
 where all the teams are competitive 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.300
 where all teams is very difficult 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.570
 put goals and then make points but 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.669
 that we will try and we must not arrive 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.080
 to the point of last year do not try 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.110
 save us in camp nou that happens 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.120
 once and may not happen again 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.039
 so we must be aware 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.160
 from minute one and do well the 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.160
 things 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:42.360
 I do not know I do not know what to tell you but if I 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.220
 give to choose the best would prefer and 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.660
 taking away the big ones at the beginning little 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.310
 to little 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:52.610
 interspersed so as not to suffer so much 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.250
 but have at the end of the league final 

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.990
 back at the end of the second round with 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.460
 more affordable equipment because I never know 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.790
 knows what can happen 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:05.600
 I do not know the final draw as they are things 

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.880
 that you can not decide neither for a 

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.230
 moment in thinking about it I do not know inside 

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.230
 of minutes we will know how we play 

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.680
 all right
