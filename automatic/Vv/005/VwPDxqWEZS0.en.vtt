quad<00:00:07.470> or<00:00:07.799> dual<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.309> guess<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.700> should<00:00:08.849> work<00:00:09.000> for

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
quad or dual I guess it should work for

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.870 
quad or dual I guess it should work for
both<00:00:09.330> but<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.769> do<00:00:10.920> quad<00:00:11.340> running

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
both but this is the you do quad running

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.849 
both but this is the you do quad running
for<00:00:12.269> point-to-point<00:00:12.920> to<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.670> 1.3<00:00:15.389> revision

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
for point-to-point to the 1.3 revision

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.050 
for point-to-point to the 1.3 revision

so once you get the XBMC installed open

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.189 
so once you get the XBMC installed open
up<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.779> xvmc<00:00:24.769> go<00:00:25.769> over<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.039> file<00:00:26.310> manager<00:00:26.789> and

download it's not very big file mind you
my<00:03:23.170> internet<00:03:23.530> isn't<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.920> greatest<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:25.600> it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
my internet isn't the greatest but it

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.550 
my internet isn't the greatest but it
still<00:03:26.680> works<00:03:26.950> pretty<00:03:27.459> well<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:28.350> mean<00:03:29.350> the

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
still works pretty well I mean the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.020 
still works pretty well I mean the
closer<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:30.010> are<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.280> writer<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.880> better

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
closer you are to the writer the better

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.270 
closer you are to the writer the better
I<00:03:31.150> guess<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:34.480> once<00:03:34.720> that's<00:03:34.930> downloaded<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
I guess so once that's downloaded you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.660 
I guess so once that's downloaded you
can<00:03:40.350> wait<00:03:41.350> for<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.739> install<00:03:42.190> you'll<00:03:42.459> you'll

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
can wait for it to install you'll you'll

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.890 
can wait for it to install you'll you'll
