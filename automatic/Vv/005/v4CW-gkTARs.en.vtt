XD<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.420> process<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.050> doing<00:02:16.170> that

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
XD I that at the process of doing that

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.320 
XD I that at the process of doing that
actually<00:02:16.740> knocks<00:02:17.340> hey<00:02:17.550> what<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:17.880> strips<00:02:18.210> the

hdcp<00:02:19.200> copy<00:02:19.470> protection<00:02:20.040> signal<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:21.240> it's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
hdcp copy protection signal so it's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.950 
hdcp copy protection signal so it's
quite<00:02:21.690> straightforward<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.620> clap<00:02:22.860> top<00:02:23.960> now

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
quite straightforward to clap top now

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.780 
quite straightforward to clap top now

it but that's what I am the second
option<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.730> something<00:03:51.150> that's<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.570> little<00:03:52.200> bit

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
option is something that's a little bit

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.860 
option is something that's a little bit
cheaper<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.549> little<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:53.940> more<00:03:54.120> simplistic
