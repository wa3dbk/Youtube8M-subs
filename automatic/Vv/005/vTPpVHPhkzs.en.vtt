I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> import<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.880> using

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
I'm going to import it and I'm using

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.380 
I'm going to import it and I'm using
this<00:00:24.420> because<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.990> has<00:00:25.140> dialogue<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.390> or

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
this because it has dialogue on there or

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.359 
this because it has dialogue on there or
inside<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.140> there's<00:00:28.560> dialog<00:00:29.039> where

you can actually hear really what the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.170 
you can actually hear really what the
effects<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.439> doing<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.489> ten

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
effects are doing this is about ten

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.810 
effects are doing this is about ten
minute<00:00:36.420> video<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.590> only<00:00:37.920> took<00:00:38.190> probably

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
minute video so no it only took probably

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.819 
minute video so no it only took probably
seven<00:00:39.420> seconds<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> extract<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> audio<00:00:40.500> out

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

here<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.320> five<00:00:49.649> effects<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.579> choose<00:00:50.789> from

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
here we have five effects to choose from

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
here we have five effects to choose from
there<00:00:52.320> will<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.829> effects<00:00:53.219> added<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.850> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
there will be more effects added as I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.319 
there will be more effects added as I
figure<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> create<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.850> okay<00:00:56.850> I'm

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
figure out how to create them okay I'm

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.860 
figure out how to create them okay I'm
going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> add<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.440> delay<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.480> this<00:01:00.480> checkbox

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
going to add a delay now this checkbox

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
going to add a delay now this checkbox
means<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.190> enabled<00:01:02.699> if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.210> uncheck

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
means that it is enabled if you uncheck

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
means that it is enabled if you uncheck
it<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.260> applied<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it it will not be applied to the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.120 
it it will not be applied to the
ringtone<00:01:05.869> I'm<00:01:06.869> gonna<00:01:07.020> slide<00:01:07.380> over<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
ringtone I'm gonna slide over to where I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.030 
ringtone I'm gonna slide over to where I
know<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> actual<00:01:09.210> dialogue<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.040> then

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
know there is actual dialogue and then

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
know there is actual dialogue and then
I'm<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.250> preview<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:14.240> kind<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.299> quiet<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
I'm gonna preview it kind of quiet so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.899 
I'm gonna preview it kind of quiet so
I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> add<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> boost<00:01:16.830> effect<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.700> what

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
I'm going to add a boost effect now what

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.340 
I'm going to add a boost effect now what
this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.119> doing<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> apply<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this is doing is it's going to apply the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
this is doing is it's going to apply the
delay<00:01:19.770> effect<00:01:20.100> first<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:21.090> apply<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> boost

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
delay effect first then apply a boost

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
delay effect first then apply a boost
effect<00:01:22.350> boosting<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.070> increase<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.850> volume

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
effect boosting will increase the volume

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.550 
effect boosting will increase the volume
past<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> hundred<00:01:25.110> percent

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
past a hundred percent

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
past a hundred percent
it'll<00:01:25.830> take<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> hundred<00:01:26.310> percent<00:01:26.490> volume<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it'll take the hundred percent volume if

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.649 
it'll take the hundred percent volume if
you<00:01:27.330> put<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.979> 50%<00:01:28.979> volume<00:01:29.369> it'll<00:01:30.210> multiply

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you put it at 50% volume it'll multiply

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.410 
you put it at 50% volume it'll multiply
to<00:01:31.049> fifty<00:01:31.380> percent<00:01:31.650> volume<00:01:31.920> by<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.729> hundred

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to fifty percent volume by a hundred

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.219 
to fifty percent volume by a hundred
percent

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
percent

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.740 
percent
so<00:01:35.920> that's<00:01:36.100> 150<00:01:36.640> percent<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.390> here<00:01:37.630> we're

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
so that's 150 percent so here we're

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.910 
so that's 150 percent so here we're
gonna<00:01:37.869> do<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.079> 200%<00:01:38.799> volume<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:41.530> can<00:01:41.649> go<00:01:41.770> into

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
gonna do a 200% volume we can go into

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.709 
gonna do a 200% volume we can go into
the<00:01:42.130> settings<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.700> increase<00:01:43.090> it<00:01:43.240> even<00:01:43.479> more

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
the settings and increase it even more

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.590 
the settings and increase it even more
you<00:01:44.679> can<00:01:44.770> do<00:01:44.950> up<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.130> 10<00:01:45.460> times<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:46.090> volume<00:01:46.420> I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
you can do up to 10 times the volume I

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can do up to 10 times the volume I
don't<00:01:46.810> suggest<00:01:47.020> doing<00:01:47.320> that<00:01:47.560> unless<00:01:47.890> it's

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
don't suggest doing that unless it's

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.669 
don't suggest doing that unless it's
really<00:01:48.640> quiet<00:01:48.909> audio<00:01:49.329> I'm<00:01:49.990> gonna<00:01:50.200> boost<00:01:50.409> it<00:01:50.590> by

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
really quiet audio I'm gonna boost it by

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.429 
really quiet audio I'm gonna boost it by
one<00:01:50.920> time<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.390> delay<00:01:52.689> has<00:01:52.929> settings<00:01:53.259> as<00:01:53.409> well

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
one time the delay has settings as well

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.730 
one time the delay has settings as well
as<00:01:53.829> far<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.250> delay<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:55.179> 200<00:01:55.960> milliseconds<00:01:56.619> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
as far as delay of 200 milliseconds and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.969 
as far as delay of 200 milliseconds and
then<00:01:56.890> mixing<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.579> delayed<00:01:58.000> signal<00:01:58.539> at<00:01:58.929> 75%<00:01:59.920> of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
then mixing the delayed signal at 75% of

yes<00:05:10.580> I'm<00:05:10.820> not<00:05:11.030> overwrite<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:12.290> it's

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
yes I'm not overwrite it so it's

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.710 
yes I'm not overwrite it so it's
creating<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.250> ringtone<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:16.070> now<00:05:16.820> it<00:05:17.060> says<00:05:17.270> it

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
creating the ringtone and now it says it

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.180 
creating the ringtone and now it says it
says<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.080> ringtone<00:05:18.500> blah<00:05:18.860> blah<00:05:19.010> blah<00:05:19.160> I

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
says the ringtone blah blah blah I

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.550

created<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.090> ringer<00:05:20.450> will<00:05:20.600> now<00:05:20.720> transfer<00:05:21.290> the

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
created I ringer will now transfer the

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100 
created I ringer will now transfer the
media<00:05:21.860> over<00:05:22.070> SCP<00:05:22.790> so<00:05:23.120> it's<00:05:23.600> now<00:05:23.810> going<00:05:24.020> to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
media over SCP so it's now going to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.990 
media over SCP so it's now going to
connect<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.650> server<00:05:24.860> login<00:05:25.490> with<00:05:25.880> your

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
connect to the server login with your

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.659 
connect to the server login with your
username<00:05:26.060> and<00:05:26.540> password<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:27.550> transfer<00:05:28.550> the

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
username and password and transfer the

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.430 
username and password and transfer the
file<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.810> might<00:05:29.990> take<00:05:30.020> some<00:05:30.410> time

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
file so this might take some time

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.710 
file so this might take some time
because<00:05:31.040> this<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> 30<00:05:31.790> second<00:05:32.150> ringtone<00:05:32.510> so

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
because this is a 30 second ringtone so

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.370 
because this is a 30 second ringtone so
it's<00:05:32.900> probably<00:05:33.470> about<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.740> half<00:05:33.919> and

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
it's probably about a half and

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.070 
it's probably about a half and
right<00:05:36.140> well<00:05:37.140> that's<00:05:37.320> doing<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.070> have

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
right well that's doing that I have

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.730 
right well that's doing that I have
command<00:05:40.080> prawns<00:05:40.320> open<00:05:40.740> at<00:05:41.810> my<00:05:42.810> on<00:05:43.200> my<00:05:43.260> server

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
command prawns open at my on my server

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.110 
command prawns open at my on my server
so<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.100> can<00:05:44.310> see<00:05:44.840> if<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.020> transfers<00:05:46.440> or<00:05:46.590> not<00:05:47.120> it

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
so I can see if it transfers or not it

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.490 
so I can see if it transfers or not it
