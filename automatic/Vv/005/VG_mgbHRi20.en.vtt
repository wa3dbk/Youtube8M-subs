could<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.510> various<00:00:21.930> options<00:00:22.230> at<00:00:22.800> for

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
could look at various options at for

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
could look at various options at for
moving<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.430> night<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.359> i<00:00:24.390> decided<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
moving the night but i decided to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710 
moving the night but i decided to
counter-attack<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.279> create<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.730> own<00:00:26.760> fret<00:00:27.090> h5

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
counter-attack to create my own fret h5

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.880 
counter-attack to create my own fret h5
and<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:29.789> Queen<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.689> went<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> h4<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> again

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and the Queen now went to h4 and again

and the Queen now went to h4 and again
I'm<00:00:32.130> looking<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.669> fret<00:00:32.910> again<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I'm looking at this fret again and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.410 
I'm looking at this fret again and
thinking<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:35.250> primary<00:00:35.670> concern<00:00:35.790> should

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
thinking well my primary concern should

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.670 
thinking well my primary concern should
be<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.380> address<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.950> fret<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
be to address the fret and here is the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
be to address the fret and here is the
really<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.579> wanted<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:43.410> discuss<00:00:43.969> in

really the thing I wanted to discuss in

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.420 
really the thing I wanted to discuss in
this<00:00:45.239> position<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:46.350> okay<00:00:46.770> especially<00:00:47.250> in

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
this position there okay especially in

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.540 
this position there okay especially in
blitz<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> can't<00:00:49.020> always<00:00:49.200> try<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.649> find<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
blitz you can't always try and find the

the position and I think what I wanted
to<00:01:51.990> highlight<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.460> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
to highlight here is that it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.910 
to highlight here is that it's
particularly<00:01:54.360> ridiculous<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.770> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
particularly ridiculous when your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
particularly ridiculous when your
opponent<00:01:56.250> has<00:01:56.310> clear<00:01:56.850> liabilities<00:01:57.590> if<00:01:58.590> you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
opponent has clear liabilities if you

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
opponent has clear liabilities if you
intuitively<00:01:59.159> assess<00:01:59.729> here<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> queen

intuitively assess here that this queen

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.499 
intuitively assess here that this queen
is<00:02:01.500> run<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.250> squares<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.119> only<00:02:03.299> got

then looking again trying to evaluate

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.270 
then looking again trying to evaluate
Queenie<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:56.290> it's<00:02:57.290> interesting<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:58.010> this

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
Queenie for it's interesting that this

bias of this fret which I suspended

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.220 
bias of this fret which I suspended
addressing<00:03:02.209> for<00:03:02.359> one<00:03:02.480> move<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.049> did

from now so without bias of any threats

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.279 
from now so without bias of any threats
what<00:05:58.039> would<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:58.250> play<00:05:58.460> here<00:05:58.789> as<00:05:58.970> black<00:05:59.419> if<00:05:59.690> I

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
what would you play here as black if I

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:08.100 
what would you play here as black if I
gave<00:06:00.530> you<00:06:00.650> 10<00:06:00.860> seconds<00:06:01.870> starting<00:06:02.870> from<00:06:03.080> now

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.900 

okay<00:06:09.110> black<00:06:09.770> can<00:06:09.980> actually<00:06:10.400> ignore

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
okay black can actually ignore

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.390 
okay black can actually ignore
completely<00:06:11.600> this<00:06:12.290> fret<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.710> just<00:06:13.160> use<00:06:13.280> the

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
completely this fret and just use the

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.280 
completely this fret and just use the
benefit<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:13.940> that<00:06:14.150> night<00:06:14.600> they're<00:06:14.900> actually

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
benefit of that night they're actually

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.950 
benefit of that night they're actually
stopping<00:06:15.530> the<00:06:15.710> Queen<00:06:15.950> going<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.610> h3<00:06:16.760> and<00:06:17.240> the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
benefit of that last move as well

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.030 
benefit of that last move as well
stopping<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.820> Queen<00:06:20.030> going<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:20.750> g4<00:06:21.260> so<00:06:21.920> these

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 
takes f4 is given by the engine if I

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.350 
takes f4 is given by the engine if I
just<00:06:45.380> quickly<00:06:45.590> show<00:06:45.680> you<00:06:45.830> here<00:06:46.160> so<00:06:47.030> Queen

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
just quickly show you here so Queen

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.830

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
takes f4 we're talking minus 5 so it's

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.030 
takes f4 we're talking minus 5 so it's
one<00:06:51.020> of<00:06:51.110> those<00:06:51.230> things<00:06:51.290> but<00:06:51.710> it<00:06:51.830> probably

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
one of those things but it probably

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.480 
one of those things but it probably
happens<00:06:52.520> a<00:06:52.760> lot<00:06:53.450> more<00:06:53.660> frequently<00:06:54.170> than<00:06:54.500> we

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
happens a lot more frequently than we

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.620 
happens a lot more frequently than we
imagined<00:06:55.940> even<00:06:56.710> in<00:06:57.710> long<00:06:57.920> games<00:06:58.160> that<00:06:58.630> we

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
imagined even in long games that we

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.930 
imagined even in long games that we
always<00:07:00.110> pursuing<00:07:00.680> the<00:07:00.860> practical<00:07:01.430> and<00:07:01.670> not

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
always pursuing the practical and not

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.550 
always pursuing the practical and not
the<00:07:02.060> theoretical<00:07:02.540> which<00:07:02.690> is<00:07:02.810> a<00:07:02.840> good<00:07:03.080> thing<00:07:03.140> in

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
the theoretical which is a good thing in

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.920 
the theoretical which is a good thing in
many<00:07:03.800> in<00:07:04.040> many<00:07:04.460> cases<00:07:04.940> we<00:07:05.150> only<00:07:05.510> have<00:07:05.720> limited

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
many in many cases we only have limited

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.300 
many in many cases we only have limited
time<00:07:06.350> on<00:07:06.560> our<00:07:06.710> clocks<00:07:07.780> so<00:07:08.780> when<00:07:08.990> we<00:07:09.500> verbalize

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
time on our clocks so when we verbalize

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.180 
time on our clocks so when we verbalize
on<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.670> opponent's<00:07:10.850> got<00:07:11.210> fret<00:07:11.800> it's<00:07:12.800> like<00:07:13.010> we

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
on the opponent's got fret it's like we

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.340 
on the opponent's got fret it's like we
restrict<00:07:13.700> automatically<00:07:14.600> shrink<00:07:14.960> up<00:07:15.140> our

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350 
restrict automatically shrink up our

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.930 
restrict automatically shrink up our
options<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:16.070> addressing<00:07:16.490> the<00:07:16.580> threat<00:07:16.610> and

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
options to addressing the threat and

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.320 
options to addressing the threat and
that's<00:07:17.060> a<00:07:17.210> bias<00:07:18.370> you<00:07:19.370> know<00:07:19.460> biases<00:07:20.090> are

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
that's a bias you know biases are

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.580 
that's a bias you know biases are
avoided<00:07:21.700> our<00:07:22.700> ability<00:07:23.540> to<00:07:23.930> to<00:07:24.140> play<00:07:24.410> more

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
avoided our ability to to play more

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.540 
avoided our ability to to play more
perfect<00:07:25.130> more<00:07:25.430> correct<00:07:25.840> chess<00:07:27.280> so<00:07:28.280> I<00:07:28.310> just

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
perfect more correct chess so I just

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.700 
perfect more correct chess so I just
thought<00:07:28.670> I'd<00:07:28.820> mention<00:07:28.850> that<00:07:29.300> and<00:07:29.450> maybe<00:07:30.290> do<00:07:30.680> a

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
thought I'd mention that and maybe do a

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.680 
thought I'd mention that and maybe do a
more<00:07:30.920> detailed<00:07:30.950> video<00:07:31.700> of<00:07:31.850> other<00:07:32.060> examples<00:07:32.240> in

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
more detailed video of other examples in

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:33.910 
more detailed video of other examples in
the<00:07:32.780> future<00:07:33.050> but<00:07:33.170> I<00:07:33.230> thought<00:07:33.410> I'd<00:07:33.530> mention<00:07:33.650> it

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:33.920 
the future but I thought I'd mention it

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.220 
the future but I thought I'd mention it
here<00:07:34.330> because<00:07:35.330> it's<00:07:35.810> quite<00:07:35.960> an<00:07:36.050> interesting

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:36.230 
here because it's quite an interesting

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.350 
here because it's quite an interesting
point<00:07:36.560> to<00:07:36.950> make<00:07:37.100> comments<00:07:37.760> or<00:07:37.850> questions<00:07:38.060> on
