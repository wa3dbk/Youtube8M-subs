00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.969
 exactly 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:29.419
 I'm a neurologist look we go to the store 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.529
 we can then shop and this is at the beginning of the game 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.499
 let's dial the code for money 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:40.999

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.999
