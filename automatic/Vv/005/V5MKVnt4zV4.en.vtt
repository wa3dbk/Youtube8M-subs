00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529 
okay so now that you've installed vmware

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.289 
okay so now that you've installed vmware
successfully<00:00:04.529> launched<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.490> make<00:00:05.940> sure<00:00:05.970> it's

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
successfully launched it make sure it's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.020 
successfully launched it make sure it's
open<00:00:06.629> properly<00:00:07.319> we're<00:00:08.250> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.429> create<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.760> VM

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
open properly we're going to create a VM

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.410 
open properly we're going to create a VM
okay<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.260> guest<00:00:10.500> machine<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.849> file

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
okay so this is a guest machine so file

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.709 
okay so this is a guest machine so file
new<00:00:12.719> vm<00:00:13.679> we're<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> select<00:00:14.700> custom<00:00:15.389> just

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
new vm we're going to select custom just

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
new vm we're going to select custom just
because<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.109> more<00:00:16.199> fun<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.270> make<00:00:18.270> sure<00:00:18.420> you

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
because it's more fun and make sure you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.660 
because it's more fun and make sure you
pick<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.720> version<00:00:19.199> that's<00:00:19.520> appropriate<00:00:20.520> for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
pick a version that's appropriate for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.210 
pick a version that's appropriate for
your<00:00:21.350> for<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.380> compatibility<00:00:22.890> requirements

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
your for your compatibility requirements

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
your for your compatibility requirements
okay<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.570> our<00:00:24.689> case<00:00:24.750> i'm<00:00:25.140> fine<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.099> 7.1<00:00:26.730> so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
okay so in our case i'm fine with 7.1 so

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.769 
okay so in our case i'm fine with 7.1 so
that'll<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:27.990> fine<00:00:28.400> if<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:30.179> need<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.599> migrate

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
that'll be fine if you need to migrate

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
that'll be fine if you need to migrate
this<00:00:31.199> vm<00:00:31.500> later<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> lower<00:00:32.640> version<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.420> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
this vm later to a lower version it's a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.060 
this vm later to a lower version it's a
little<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.930> more<00:00:34.110> work<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:35.040> done

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
little bit more work but it can be done

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.410 
little bit more work but it can be done
so<00:00:35.969> ah<00:00:37.430> yeah<00:00:38.430> we're<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> install<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.270> OS

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so ah yeah we're going to install the OS

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
so ah yeah we're going to install the OS
later<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.890> case<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.370> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
later and in this case we're going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.920 
later and in this case we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:42.480> i'm<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> demonstrate

you'll<00:01:06.210> find<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> vmx<00:01:07.170> file<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:09.420> right

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you'll find in the vmx file so all right

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
you'll find in the vmx file so all right
let's<00:01:10.049> go<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.470> processors<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.280> cores

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
let's go with two processors two cores

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.780 
let's go with two processors two cores
simulated<00:01:12.270> within<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> within<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> vm<00:01:13.860> let's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
simulated within the within the vm let's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.910 
simulated within the within the vm let's
give<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.330> gig<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.630> ram<00:01:15.720> ok<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.710> again

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
give this thing a gig of ram ok so again

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
give this thing a gig of ram ok so again
this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.880> resources

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this is all these are all resources

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
this is all these are all resources
we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.869> allocating<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
we're going to be allocating to the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
we're going to be allocating to the
guest<00:01:19.830> machine<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> bridge

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
guest machine and we're going to bridge

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
guest machine and we're going to bridge
the<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> only<00:01:22.590> nick<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the one and only nick that we have to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.960 
the one and only nick that we have to
find<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.619> external<00:01:26.130> interface

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
find in here to the external interface

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
find in here to the external interface
of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> host<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> for<00:01:28.890> some<00:01:29.040> terminology

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
of the host so for some terminology

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.270 
of the host so for some terminology
again<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> guest<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> virtual<00:01:32.130> machine

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
again the guest is the virtual machine

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
again the guest is the virtual machine
itself<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.240> really<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.930> process<00:01:34.500> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
itself which is really just a process or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
itself which is really just a process or
a<00:01:36.439> container<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.979> running<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:38.970> top

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a container if you like running on top

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
a container if you like running on top
of<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.869> host<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.439> host<00:01:41.040> being<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.549> actual

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of the host the host being the actual

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.219 
of the host the host being the actual
box<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> actual<00:01:44.130> operating<00:01:44.610> system<00:01:45.229> so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
box with the actual operating system so

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
box with the actual operating system so
just<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.340> next<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.540> type<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> sky<00:01:49.020> z

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
just go next on that what type of sky z

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
just go next on that what type of sky z
controller<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:49.979> emulate<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.700> we

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
controller do we want to emulate if we

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
controller do we want to emulate if we
are<00:01:51.149> using<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.540> nice<00:01:51.689> cozy<00:01:51.899> devices<00:01:52.500> which<00:01:52.979> we

are using a nice cozy devices which we

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.639 
are using a nice cozy devices which we

decays you know after what they are
actually<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.330> dr<00:02:54.570> dot<00:02:54.750> vmdk<00:02:55.320> makes<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> lot

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
actually so see dr dot vmdk makes a lot

when<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.770> say<00:04:16.950> physical<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.520> mean<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.000> know<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
when I say physical I mean you know the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.300 
when I say physical I mean you know the
the<00:04:18.480> device<00:04:19.109> that's<00:04:19.440> simulated<00:04:19.980> within<00:04:20.220> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
the device that's simulated within the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.510 
the device that's simulated within the
vm<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.510> here<00:04:21.750> we've<00:04:21.930> got<00:04:21.960> AI<00:04:22.380> de<00:04:22.919> bus<00:04:23.310> number

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
vm so here we've got AI de bus number

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.390 
vm so here we've got AI de bus number
one<00:04:23.850> bus<00:04:24.600> number<00:04:24.750> 0<00:04:25.110> ni<00:04:25.740> de<00:04:25.919> bus<00:04:26.250> number<00:04:26.430> one

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
one bus number 0 ni de bus number one

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.159 
one bus number 0 ni de bus number one
so<00:04:28.400> bus<00:04:28.669> number<00:04:28.849> zero<00:04:29.240> has<00:04:29.449> a<00:04:29.479> master<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.080> a

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
so bus number zero has a master in a

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.710 
so bus number zero has a master in a
slave<00:04:30.430> bus<00:04:31.430> number<00:04:31.610> one<00:04:31.909> has<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> master<00:04:32.569> in<00:04:32.659> a

concept of virtual LANs basically a

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.300 
concept of virtual LANs basically a
whole<00:05:11.030> bunch<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.360> fake<00:05:11.629> switches<00:05:12.259> and<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:13.129> can

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
whole bunch of fake switches and I can

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.080 
whole bunch of fake switches and I can
connect<00:05:13.639> my<00:05:14.479> NYX<00:05:14.780> my<00:05:15.379> virtual<00:05:16.129> Nick's<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.940> any

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
connect my NYX my virtual Nick's to any

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.629 
connect my NYX my virtual Nick's to any
one<00:05:17.270> of<00:05:17.300> these<00:05:17.449> virtual<00:05:17.930> switches<00:05:18.370> ok<00:05:19.370> so<00:05:19.460> this

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
one of these virtual switches ok so this

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.189 
one of these virtual switches ok so this
allows<00:05:19.789> me<00:05:19.940> to<00:05:20.120> simulate<00:05:20.599> all<00:05:20.750> kinds<00:05:21.110> of

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
allows me to simulate all kinds of

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.869 
allows me to simulate all kinds of
firewall<00:05:21.680> situations<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.550> routing

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:22.879 
firewall situations and routing

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.279 
firewall situations and routing
situations<00:05:23.449> and<00:05:23.569> all<00:05:23.690> kinds<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.050> cool<00:05:24.229> stuff

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
situations and all kinds of cool stuff

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.230 
situations and all kinds of cool stuff
so<00:05:24.800> so<00:05:25.190> I'm<00:05:25.280> going<00:05:25.400> to<00:05:25.430> take<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.699> second<00:05:26.060> nic

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
so so I'm going to take the second nic

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.600 
so so I'm going to take the second nic
the<00:05:26.810> second<00:05:27.199> network<00:05:27.319> card<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.099> plug<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.460> into

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
the second network card and plug it into

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.019 
the second network card and plug it into
a<00:05:28.789> dead<00:05:29.539> switch<00:05:30.110> ok<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:30.590> as<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> switch<00:05:31.159> on<00:05:31.400> which

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
a dead switch ok so as a switch on which

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.779 
a dead switch ok so as a switch on which
only<00:05:32.389> one<00:05:33.020> host<00:05:33.289> is<00:05:33.500> plugged<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:34.370> we<00:05:34.460> go<00:05:34.580> finish

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
only one host is plugged so we go finish

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:41.290 
only one host is plugged so we go finish
on<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.090> guy<00:05:35.419> go<00:05:36.139> okay<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:40.060> one<00:05:41.060> more<00:05:41.270> thing

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
on that guy go okay and one more thing

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.459 
on that guy go okay and one more thing
i'm<00:05:41.690> just<00:05:41.810> going<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:41.960> change<00:05:42.229> this<00:05:44.110> added<00:05:45.110> and

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469 
i'm just going to change this added and

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:47.499 
i'm just going to change this added and
that's<00:05:46.430> actually<00:05:46.580> plugged<00:05:46.969> into<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.240> switch

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
that's actually plugged into a switch

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.540 
that's actually plugged into a switch

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
virtualized machine like you can you

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.120 
virtualized machine like you can you
hit<00:06:40.730> f2<00:06:41.180> go<00:06:41.660> into<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:41.990> phoenix<00:06:42.410> bios<00:06:42.770> that's
