00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
 I do not know if you have noticed on Snape Chat, everything ... 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.360
 Ah this ?? Yes, I have moved! 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.100
 Not true. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.120
 In fact, it's just a decor that has absolutely nothing to do with it 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.670
 LEDs do not even work. Well, this works. 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.160
 To the old people who watch this video: Snape Chat, What is it? 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.120
 It is an application that can send messages, pictures and videos that take a few seconds. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.040
 Even if you pyramid, you can download it. Just type "snape chat". 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.760
 Snape Chat, that's good. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.080
 Anti-aging technology. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.500
 Snape Chat is confusing at first. Why send an image to be deleted after that? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Photography is an art, an eighth art, it tells something. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 He is noble! 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.320
 That's it! 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.820
 I am proud to present you my antiques. 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 Does this leave you? 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.440
 Do you want to talk about this? 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.493
 Funny about Snape Chat, 

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:48.320
 There is often a difference between Snape that you send to someone of the same sex, like your friends. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.400
 And the snakes that you send to someone of the opposite sex. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640
 The type of girl you want is what belongs to me. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.360
 It's a strange behavior in Snape Chat 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.600
 We are not so in real life 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.680
 We all would like Snape to be nice, so be ugly. 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.310
 But only shameless, very sufficient. 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.040
 When your friend gets your nag on one, you want to see 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.870
 How beautiful this girl is 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.440
 I'm late, sorry. 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.760
 Come on, hello! 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.860
 Oh, the girl! 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.320
 I will do like the 5 tweets that you should avoid on Twitter 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.520
 I will give you 5 things that bother me in snape chat 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.270
 5) Alsnab painter. 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.150
 Sometimes I get some squirrels with fairy drawings! 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.560
 Watching for hours, when I compare them with my own I feel I do not know anything 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 Quietly, the man with his finger, more talent than you with all the world stationery 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 So when I get it, I do not answer. 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 In this way, the person loses his temper. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.590
 It took 3 hours for this Snape, you just had to answer. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.870
 Yes, I am an idiot. 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.200
 4) You can choose the length of your spindles 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.790
 I do not understand those who leave the longest period of time to have no value 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.060
 Why your cat is worth 10 seconds, you may limit a lot of things in 10 seconds! 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.240
 You are under arrest. 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.880
 You seem wrong! 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.120
 You have saved your life. 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.670
 Thank you so much. 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.630
 Oh, look! 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.070
 Hello mom? 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.380
 Hello. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.800
 What? 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.740
 In fact, I'm your mother ... Actually I've changed a sexy .. 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.760
 Papa! Mom! 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.660
 3) We can find out who made your screenshot 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.350
 This feature is more than wonderful and there are people who are doing screenshots for everything you do 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.160
 What is the importance of this, seriously? 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.440
 I collect pictures, print them, put them in my mouth .. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 2) There is someone who puts Snape for 10 seconds. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 On the contrary, there is someone who puts Snape for 1 second 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.880
 Do you have time to see exactly what a second? 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.030
 Think you're in a game to boost your memory? 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.920
 Luckily, photos that take seconds are often ... pornographic images. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.460
 That's why I do screenshots. 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.820
 1) Perhaps the thing that bothers me most about snape chat, 

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:19.400
 It's when I get a short video but I'm silent. 

00:03:19.401 --> 00:03:22.500
 (inaudible) 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.720
 I hope it was not interesting. 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720
 I am very much criticized for Snape, but he is still a murderer. 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.950
 Sometimes I get memorable candles from my friends. 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.800
 Besides, you can add me to the squirrels. CyprienVideo. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.760
 Simply. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.640
 On the contrary, how can you defy the snip chat 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.380
 Without mentioning the greater phobia of application users 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.860
 We are all afraid that someday ... 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 In fact, from the beginning, we have maintained the images. 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.460
 Moreover, from now on, they are available on the Internet. 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.320
 Come on, hello! 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.430
 Subscribe! 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.340
 Finally, if you feel like ... you do what you want. I just say. 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.300
