00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
here the ratios here is the hulk comes

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.289 
here the ratios here is the hulk comes
in<00:01:58.200> two<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.890> every<00:01:59.040> twenty<00:01:59.490> four<00:01:59.520> boxes<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
in two in every twenty four boxes so

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.130 
in two in every twenty four boxes so

- and twenty four is probably the most
common<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.329> got<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.869> twenty

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
common and then you got one in twenty

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
common and then you got one in twenty
four<00:02:04.320> getting<00:02:04.710> rarer<00:02:05.009> your<00:02:05.640> one<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.939> forty
