between open tabs search the web

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.939 
between open tabs search the web
directly<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.390> let's<00:00:27.660> try<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.230> search<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.859> web

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

directly will search for Alaska since
that's<00:00:32.040> where<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:39.950> pretty<00:00:40.950> cool<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that's where we are pretty cool this is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.709 
that's where we are pretty cool this is
actually<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:41.879> time<00:00:42.120> I've<00:00:42.420> used<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
actually the first time I've used this

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.920 
actually the first time I've used this
as<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.370> jittery

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
as well so it's a little bit jittery

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
as well so it's a little bit jittery
let's<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.200> that's<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
let's see that's got to be just the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
let's see that's got to be just the
unstable<00:00:48.600> ICS<00:00:49.200> build<00:00:50.239> yeah<00:00:51.710> see<00:00:52.710> me<00:00:52.860> they'll

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
unstable ICS build yeah see me they'll

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.290 
unstable ICS build yeah see me they'll
open<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> new<00:00:53.489> tab<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:58.879> give<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.149> bit

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
open a new tab here give it a little bit

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.070 
open a new tab here give it a little bit
of<00:01:00.390> rotate

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.950 

and<00:01:06.770> let's<00:01:07.130> try<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:07.550> go<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.820> as<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.260> dpreview<00:01:10.960> go

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
and let's try and go it as a dpreview go

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.010 
and let's try and go it as a dpreview go
there<00:01:12.740> we<00:01:12.860> go<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.000> crashed<00:01:14.330> let's<00:01:14.900> try

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
there we go so that crashed let's try

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:32.290 
there we go so that crashed let's try
again<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:19.280> we'll<00:01:19.490> go<00:01:19.640> back<00:01:24.490> dpreview<00:01:25.490> com

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.140 

not<00:01:32.930> too<00:01:33.230> bad<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.770> seems<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.340> little<00:01:34.550> bit<00:01:34.790> slow

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
not too bad it seems a little bit slow

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.090 
not too bad it seems a little bit slow
but<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:36.260> probably<00:01:36.650> isn't<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> greatest

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
but this probably isn't the greatest

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.200 
but this probably isn't the greatest
device<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.940> test<00:01:38.120> this<00:01:38.300> on<00:01:38.480> but<00:01:40.060> let's<00:01:41.060> see

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
device to test this on but let's see

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.430 
device to test this on but let's see
yeah<00:01:41.450> we're<00:01:41.690> sort<00:01:41.870> of<00:01:41.900> stuck<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.350> our

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
yeah we're sort of stuck in our

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.870 
yeah we're sort of stuck in our
scrolling<00:01:42.950> here<00:01:43.160> see<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.520> crashes<00:01:43.970> again

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
scrolling here see the crashes again

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.350 
scrolling here see the crashes again
yeah<00:01:46.900> wait<00:01:47.900> though

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.040 

so<00:01:54.930> beta<00:01:55.440> chrome<00:01:55.980> on<00:01:56.250> Alpha<00:01:56.730> IC<00:01:57.390> s<00:01:57.510> equals

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
so beta chrome on Alpha IC s equals

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.310 
so beta chrome on Alpha IC s equals
unstable<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.150> probably<00:02:00.150> not<00:02:00.330> very<00:02:00.390> effective

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
unstable and probably not very effective

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.270 
unstable and probably not very effective
way<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:03.120> browse<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.540> internet<00:02:04.280> that
