00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.490 

so<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:10.520> Generac<00:00:11.870> standby<00:00:12.870> generator

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
so this is a Generac standby generator

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.750 
so this is a Generac standby generator
Generac<00:00:14.190> Centurion<00:00:15.030> we've<00:00:15.270> had<00:00:15.629> it<00:00:16.760> installed

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
Generac Centurion we've had it installed

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.179 
Generac Centurion we've had it installed
now<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:19.310> five<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.490> six<00:00:20.520> years<00:00:21.859> never<00:00:22.859> really

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
now for five or six years never really

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.050 
now for five or six years never really
paid<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> whole<00:00:24.179> lot<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.509> attention<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:26.060> it's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
paid a whole lot of attention to it it's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.479 
paid a whole lot of attention to it it's
doing<00:00:27.509> its<00:00:27.839> weekly<00:00:28.439> cycling<00:00:29.359> run<00:00:30.359> now

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
doing its weekly cycling run now

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.299 
doing its weekly cycling run now
and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.239> didn't<00:00:33.780> know<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.290> gas<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.190> was

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and I didn't know how much gas it was

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.280 
and I didn't know how much gas it was
actually<00:00:35.760> using<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.840> trying<00:00:37.260> something

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
actually using so I'm trying something

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.160 
actually using so I'm trying something
to<00:00:40.290> quantify<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.549 

this<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.350> our<00:00:45.640> gas<00:00:46.640> meter<00:00:47.000> on<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.960> opposite

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
this is our gas meter on the opposite

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.069 
this is our gas meter on the opposite
opposite<00:00:49.430> side<00:00:49.640> of<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.879> house<00:00:50.059> you<00:00:50.690> can<00:00:50.840> hear

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
opposite side of the house you can hear

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.680 
opposite side of the house you can hear
that<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.440> got<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.620> lot<00:00:51.860> more<00:00:52.129> quiet<00:00:53.110> because<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
that it got a lot more quiet because the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.210 
that it got a lot more quiet because the
generator<00:00:56.690> although<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:57.559> running<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.040> out

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
generator although it's running is out

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.490 
generator although it's running is out
of<00:00:58.370> range<00:00:59.320> so<00:01:00.320> what<00:01:00.470> I'm<00:01:00.620> doing<00:01:00.650> is<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.460> have<00:01:01.640> my

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
of range so what I'm doing is I have my

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.850 
of range so what I'm doing is I have my
little<00:01:03.500> handheld<00:01:03.920> camera<00:01:04.759> here<00:01:05.440> set<00:01:06.440> up<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.830> a

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
little handheld camera here set up on a

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.880 
little handheld camera here set up on a
low<00:01:07.759> resolution<00:01:09.640> movie<00:01:10.640> mode<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.890> I'm

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
low resolution movie mode and I'm

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.980 
low resolution movie mode and I'm
recording<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:14.450> meter

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
recording the meter

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.279 
recording the meter
I<00:01:15.070> started<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:16.220> before<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.630> generator

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
I started it before the generator

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.730 
I started it before the generator
generator<00:01:20.289> spun<00:01:21.289> up<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:22.700> am<00:01:23.690> going<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.590> let

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
generator spun up and I am going to let

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.310 
generator spun up and I am going to let
it<00:01:24.800> record<00:01:25.250> until<00:01:25.700> it's<00:01:26.420> finished<00:01:26.899> with<00:01:27.140> its

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
it record until it's finished with its

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.969 
it record until it's finished with its
15<00:01:27.830> minute<00:01:29.770> exercise<00:01:30.770> cycle<00:01:31.899> so<00:01:32.899> when<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.710> get

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
15 minute exercise cycle so when I get

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.090 
15 minute exercise cycle so when I get
that<00:01:34.190> video<00:01:34.580> processed<00:01:35.300> how<00:01:35.679> I'll<00:01:36.679> attach<00:01:36.890> it

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
that video processed how I'll attach it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.249 
that video processed how I'll attach it
to<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.399> video<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.179> I'll<00:01:38.690> let<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.140> what

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
to this video and I'll let you see what

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:47.039 
to this video and I'll let you see what
I<00:01:39.289> got

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.620 

you're<00:01:48.049> looking<00:01:48.380> at<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.740> gas<00:01:49.250> meter<00:01:49.549> now<00:01:49.880> just

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
you're looking at the gas meter now just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.889 
you're looking at the gas meter now just
before<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.229> generator<00:01:52.040> starts<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:53.570> notice

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
before the generator starts you notice

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.600 
before the generator starts you notice
the<00:01:55.000> dial<00:01:56.000> on<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.930> lower<00:01:57.170> left<00:01:57.560> quadrant<00:01:58.040> of

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the dial on the lower left quadrant of

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.080 
the dial on the lower left quadrant of
the<00:01:59.560> gas<00:02:00.560> meter<00:02:00.770> face<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.430> starting<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.909> move

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
the gas meter face is starting to move

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.499 
the gas meter face is starting to move
now<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.770> dial<00:02:04.219> is<00:02:04.549> in<00:02:05.240> increments<00:02:05.719> of<00:02:07.090> half<00:02:08.090> a

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
now that dial is in increments of half a

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.850 
now that dial is in increments of half a
cubic<00:02:08.989> foot<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:10.579> dial<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.410> right<00:02:12.620> of

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
cubic foot the dial just to the right of

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.830 
cubic foot the dial just to the right of
it<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.549> bottom<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:15.940> has<00:02:16.940> increments<00:02:17.720> of

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
it on the bottom is has increments of

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.880 
it on the bottom is has increments of
two<00:02:18.530> cubic<00:02:19.220> feet<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:22.880> each<00:02:23.209> increment<00:02:23.890> on

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
two cubic feet so for each increment on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.120 
two cubic feet so for each increment on
the<00:02:25.850> dial<00:02:26.359> to<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> right<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:29.030> left<00:02:29.359> will

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
the dial to the right the the left will

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.789 
the dial to the right the the left will
actually<00:02:31.130> travel<00:02:31.519> four<00:02:32.269> increments<00:02:34.600> so<00:02:35.799> by

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
actually travel four increments so by

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.759 
actually travel four increments so by
counting<00:02:37.310> these<00:02:37.989> rotations<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
counting these rotations and the

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.860 
counting these rotations and the
rotation<00:02:40.370> specifically<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> rotations<00:02:41.720> of

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
rotation specifically the rotations of

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.750 
rotation specifically the rotations of
the<00:02:42.230> right<00:02:43.190> hand<00:02:43.609> meter<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:45.400> should<00:02:46.400> get<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the right hand meter I should get a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.309 
the right hand meter I should get a
pretty<00:02:47.060> close<00:02:47.420> estimate<00:02:48.019> on<00:02:48.440> how<00:02:49.400> many

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
pretty close estimate on how many

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.910 
pretty close estimate on how many
cubic<00:02:52.040> feet<00:02:52.249> of<00:02:52.489> gas<00:02:53.140> is<00:02:54.140> consumed<00:02:54.680> by<00:02:54.859> the

week the dials in the top row are what

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.050 
week the dials in the top row are what
the<00:03:11.079> meter<00:03:12.079> reader<00:03:12.680> actually<00:03:13.159> reads<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
the meter reader actually reads and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.369 
the meter reader actually reads and
