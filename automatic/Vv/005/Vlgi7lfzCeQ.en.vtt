 language com to her in this video we 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 let's get acquainted with the modified version 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.520
 md radeon r9 285 is included in the new series 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 cards asus strix main advantage 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 asus radeon r9 280x msi is 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 technology support 0 decibel fan 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 which allows you to completely disable 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.890
 cooling fans in mode 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.630
 idle this feature opens 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 broad prospects for creating on her 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 low noise computer base which 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.500
 working with documents or viewing 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.460
 movies become completely silent 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.960
 the novelty is equipped with factory overclocking 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 GPU frequency 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 increased by 47 megahertz memory on 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 fifty megahertz 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 such an increase compared to the reference 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.820
 scheme will allow some increase 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.989
 performance in games and benchmarks 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.579
 also to the main advantage of this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530
 video card refers digital under 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 system which includes solid-state

 also tantalum polymer capacitors 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.369
 skype data components allow two 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.350
 and a half times longer service life 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.090
 graphic adapter which undoubtedly 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.090
 is a positive thing 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.070

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.489
 allow you to connect almost any 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.989
 modern monitor or tv also 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.120
 analog connection possible 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.870
 monitor when using adapter 2nd 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 from dice up 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.320
 the novelty is equipped with a proprietary system 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.550
 cooling hole 2 it consists of 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.470
 large radiator based 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.150
 nickel-plated plates as well as two 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 ninety-four fan diameter 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.450
 millimeter 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.370
 for heat dissipation and its uniform 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.080
 distribution is used five copper 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.090
 heat pipes of different diameter 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.130
 they are coated with nickel and reliably 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.900
 soldered to the base and radiator fins 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.060
 which certainly increases reliability and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.650
 overall system performance 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.600
 auto rotation speed mode 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.330
 graphic temperature fans 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.860
 processor did not exceed 72 degrees at 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.540
 In this they worked very quietly and 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.180
 practically did not stand out from the others 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.800
 testbed components as the main 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.150
 feature of the cooling system of the novelty 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.930
 manifested after switching to mode 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.270
 simple 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.490
 thanks to technology support 0 dB 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.350
 fan fan and completely stopped 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.480
 and went into silent mode 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.760
 thanks to this with proper selection 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.080
 all components can create a computer 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.560
 which will work absolutely 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.910
 silently with little load if 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 evaluate the performance of a given 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.510
 video card then it will allow comfortable 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.250
 play most of the modern games on 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.740
 high graphic settings when 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.240
 Full hd resolution of such speed 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.130
 will be quite enough for the assembly 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.290
 gaming computer average price 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.070
 range especially if supplement it 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.070
 productive processor 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.459
 now let's explore the possibilities 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.420
 overclocking novelty frequency 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.430
 graphics core 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.820
 managed to raise almost 24 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.160
 percent to 1211 megahertz which is 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.979
 just wonderful result also up 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.199
 6000 860 megahertz frequency has been increased 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.810
 graphic memory which corresponds 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.060
 a gain of 32 percent in the end frequency 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.130
 frame changes in games increased by 21 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.880
 percentage of which is quite noticeable 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:42.460
 the result is asus video card 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
 radeon r9 280x msi 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.240
 turned out to be a very good device in 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.220
 in addition to quality 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.930
 element base and enhanced 10 phase 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.490
 power subsystem it also possesses 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.770
 good factory overclocking 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.570
 I especially want to mention quietly effective 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.949
 cooling system which is not only 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.300
 copes with its 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.800
 immediate tasks 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.509
 but also able to go completely 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.970
 passive mode of operation with a small 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.389
 load based on asus radeon 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.830
 r9 280x msi can create excellent 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.960
 gaming machine average price 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.820
 performance range which 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.250
 can be further increased thanks to 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.930
 good overclocking potential with 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.120
