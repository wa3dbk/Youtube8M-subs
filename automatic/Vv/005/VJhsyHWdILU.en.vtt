some<00:02:24.959> time<00:02:25.200> over<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.560> summer<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.069> i<00:02:26.160> really

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
some time over the summer and i really

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
some time over the summer and i really
wanted<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> build<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:27.000> channel<00:02:27.360> up<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.629> kind

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
wanted to build this channel up and kind

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.190 
wanted to build this channel up and kind
of<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.020> where<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.200> could<00:02:28.410> go<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.190> I've

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
of see where i could go with it but I've

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.940 
of see where i could go with it but I've
partially<00:02:31.200> run<00:02:31.379> out<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> things<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.920> talk

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
partially run out of things to talk

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.280 
partially run out of things to talk
about<00:02:32.129> with<00:02:32.400> part<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> swarm<00:02:33.239> I've<00:02:34.050> also

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
about with part of the swarm I've also

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.860 
about with part of the swarm I've also
actually<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.700> damaged<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:36.209> vocal<00:02:36.599> cords

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
actually kind of damaged my vocal cords

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.320 
actually kind of damaged my vocal cords
a<00:02:36.959> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.290> from<00:02:37.500> doing<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.220> much<00:02:38.580> stuff

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
a little bit from doing so much stuff

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.930 
a little bit from doing so much stuff
over<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> summer<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.080> once<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.220> stopped<00:02:41.640> my

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
over the summer that once I stopped my

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.699 
over the summer that once I stopped my
vote<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.480> vocal<00:02:42.780> cords<00:02:43.050> really<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.500> started

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
vote my vocal cords really just started

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.100 
vote my vocal cords really just started
to<00:02:43.769> hurt<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.069> lot<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.629> were<00:02:45.690> telling<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
to hurt a lot and they were telling you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.240 
to hurt a lot and they were telling you
that<00:02:46.260> they<00:02:46.379> really<00:02:46.560> needed<00:02:46.800> some<00:02:47.040> time<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that they really needed some time to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.920 
that they really needed some time to
recover<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.060> i<00:02:48.090> don't<00:02:48.360> think<00:02:48.599> i'll<00:02:48.720> be<00:02:48.810> doing

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
recover so i don't think i'll be doing

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.809 
recover so i don't think i'll be doing
anything<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.769> intense<00:02:50.069> as<00:02:50.220> i<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.459> over<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
anything as intense as i was over the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.259 
anything as intense as i was over the
summer<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.500> yeah<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.800> we'll<00:02:53.129> see<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.610> mean<00:02:54.000> if

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
summer but yeah so we'll see I mean if

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.059 
summer but yeah so we'll see I mean if
legacy<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> void<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.200> inspires<00:02:55.590> me<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.830> do

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
legacy the void really inspires me to do

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
legacy the void really inspires me to do
more<00:02:56.250> stuff<00:02:56.550> than<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.849> definitely<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.450> but

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
more stuff than I definitely will but

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.570 
more stuff than I definitely will but
there's<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.110> lot<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> stuff<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.159> I<00:02:59.220> did<00:02:59.400> for

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
there's a lot of stuff that I did for

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.030 
there's a lot of stuff that I did for
heart<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.819> swarm<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.659> don't<00:03:00.840> know

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
heart of the swarm and I just don't know

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.930 
heart of the swarm and I just don't know
when<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> where<00:03:02.310> I'm<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.790> the
