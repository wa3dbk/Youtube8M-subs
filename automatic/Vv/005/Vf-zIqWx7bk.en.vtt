00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.210
 hello everyone you will laugh but 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.309
 today we have a video about the game again 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.820
 despite the fact that I have already found very 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:20.580
 good tasty pollock roe 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:23.279
 That was so delicious I decided 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.160
 try and one more this time with us 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.160
 Here is such a screen to the firm Santa Bremor 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.670
 with an incomprehensible inscription vitamins proteins 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.329
 vitamin from proteins or something that helps proteins 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.600
 vitamins 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 but no matter the whole five stars that is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 Exposure I should not be so good 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.440
 strong five years so expiration date at 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.440
 we are six months 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.270
 manufactured fleet and manufacturer but 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.739
 Belarus 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.530
 we all know that Belarusian 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:05.300
 the products are very good so this one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.300
 the game should be good looking composition 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.830
 pollock roe salt 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.830
 vegetable oil seasoning for the game 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.630
 some kind of taste and flavor enhancers 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 sodium glutamate child sees 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.210
 sodium acidity regulators lactate 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.220
 calcium malate at t t t t t t t very 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.220
 many total potassium sorbate sodium benzoate 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.810
 Well, that's probably why she’s not his ipad 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.659
 to the guest 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.030
 but this screen is the most expensive caviar from 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.920
 all that I tried and how about 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 which I shot videos 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.200
 then the links will be under the video 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:01.670
 look well and let's open it and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.799
 let's see show not squeezed a 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.490
 stamped and to be honest now 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490
 here it is 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:18.599
 differences stamping or ink 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.010
 stamp such it is not much to say 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.739
 it doesn't mean it's fake 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.099
 no just new equipment which 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.340
 buys but prints the date here 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.319
 In this way , this was most likely 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.230
 done on old equipment still 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.099
 On Soviet now manufacturers 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:43.849
 even save on equipment 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:49.019
 here is the equipment but cheaper both about 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:52.310
 and look at how she looks like she 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:57.150
 there is she bigger then there is this game 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.780
 it was delicious caviar is fine with us 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.840
 the larger one is much larger 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.319
 we are primarily interested in taste 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.319
 nice 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:27.060
 delicious . try not daughter not eat caviar 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 in any way very tasty 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:40.080
 don't even know which one is better or 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:45.840
 it's really very tasty very worthy 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:51.930
 the screen but the price she had was 96 rubles 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.730
 It cost 44 rubles, in principle, I will say 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:07.340
 well, just like that for me 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:07.340
 there is no difference but the cost is good 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.720
 good good decent game 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:22.250
 but she doesn't know on the same level here 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.620
 so I think you should not overpay 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.250
 96 rubles still for santa bremor 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.840
 if for 44 rubles this game is perfect 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.480
 no worse given smaller 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 but maybe I just came across 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.340
 this jar is 1 less but to taste it 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.340
 very tasty very good Sarah 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.440
 Petropavlovsk-Kamchatski makes excellent 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.270
 the circle is not dear santa bremor does too 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.820
 good game but 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.070
 dear because all the same I think that 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.010
 96 rubles for a game of pollock 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.020
 this is a lot of this life we ​​have nekras 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.210
 on the screen black is normal to ramen then 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.520
 and yet this game seems to me 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:11.910
 more natural and more delicious than here 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.220
 that's why the price says nothing 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.790
 can find cheap and 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:24.470
 a good game that will be even better 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:28.520
 than the road so the first place I give 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.300
 pollock roe salty breakdown 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.300
 from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:43.410
 well done guys keep it up that's all on 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:51.390
 this I drink about caviar 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:06:03.340
 I'm finishing up on this I say goodbye to you 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:05.670
