addition to call it's gonna be 59 99 so
basically<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> get

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
basically what you have that is you get

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.560 
basically what you have that is you get
like<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.289> portal<00:01:59.189> generator<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.179> mount

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
like a portal generator you get a mount

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.779 
like a portal generator you get a mount
and<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> mini<00:02:01.710> pet<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.189> well<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
and you get like a mini pet as well and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.349 
and you get like a mini pet as well and
so<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> prices<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.439> pretty<00:02:04.560> standard<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:06.060> an

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
so the prices are pretty standard for an

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.570 
so the prices are pretty standard for an
expansion<00:02:06.810> coming<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.320> for<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> major<00:02:07.829> MMO<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
expansion coming out for a major MMO and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.550 
expansion coming out for a major MMO and
I'm<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.240> really<00:02:09.360> surprised<00:02:09.869> by<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.320> by<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
I'm not really surprised by them by I

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.550 
I'm not really surprised by them by I
was<00:02:11.009> reading<00:02:11.340> comments<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.030> them

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
was reading comments on them

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.320 
was reading comments on them
I<00:02:12.620> was<00:02:12.920> actually<00:02:13.099> surprised<00:02:13.580> by<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.790> comments

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
I was actually surprised by the comments

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.910 
I was actually surprised by the comments
that<00:02:14.480> were<00:02:14.569> complaining<00:02:15.020> about<00:02:15.230> how<00:02:15.500> much<00:02:15.709> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
that were complaining about how much it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.210 
that were complaining about how much it
cost<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.489> buy<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.630> expansion<00:02:18.110> now<00:02:18.860> i<00:02:18.890> guess

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
cost to buy this expansion now i guess

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.949 
cost to buy this expansion now i guess
most<00:02:19.520> accounts<00:02:20.030> were<00:02:20.120> pertaining<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.750> is

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
most accounts were pertaining to this is

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.900 
most accounts were pertaining to this is
a<00:02:21.020> fifteen<00:02:21.380> dollar<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.680> month<00:02:21.860> game<00:02:22.190> anyway<00:02:22.640> why

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
a fifteen dollar a month game anyway why

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.470 
a fifteen dollar a month game anyway why
does<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.180> cost<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.480> much<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:25.209> maybe<00:02:26.209> i<00:02:26.360> could

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
does it cost so much and maybe i could

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.830 
does it cost so much and maybe i could
sort<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.290> see<00:02:27.590> what<00:02:28.130> they're<00:02:28.330> kind<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.480> saying

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
sort of see what they're kind of saying

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.790 
sort of see what they're kind of saying
however<00:02:30.650> um<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:32.360> left<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.959> believe<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.530> no

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
however um I'm left to believe that no

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.199 
however um I'm left to believe that no
matter<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.250> game<00:02:34.459> whether<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.849> was<00:02:34.940> free<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
matter the game whether it was free to

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.670 
matter the game whether it was free to
play<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:35.810> would<00:02:35.900> cost<00:02:36.319> probably

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
play or not it would cost probably

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.660 
play or not it would cost probably
around<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.190> much<00:02:37.459> for<00:02:38.390> an<00:02:38.630> expansion<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
around this much for an expansion and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.050 
around this much for an expansion and
the<00:02:40.670> fact<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.239> still<00:02:41.540> sub<00:02:41.900> based<00:02:42.200> well

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the fact that it's still sub based well

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.550 
the fact that it's still sub based well
it's<00:02:44.060> obviously<00:02:44.600> doing<00:02:44.840> well<00:02:45.080> enough<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.350> I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
it's obviously doing well enough that I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.259 
it's obviously doing well enough that I
can<00:02:45.620> stay<00:02:45.950> some<00:02:46.250> based<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.850> whether<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> goes

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
can stay some based and whether it goes

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.840 
can stay some based and whether it goes
framing<00:02:47.690> or<00:02:47.900> not<00:02:48.049> in<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.830> future<00:02:49.190> well<00:02:49.580> that's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
framing or not in the future well that's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.330 
framing or not in the future well that's
up<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.660> guess<00:02:50.959> how<00:02:51.170> well<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:51.860> expansion

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
up to I guess how well this expansion

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.130 
up to I guess how well this expansion
does<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:52.940> there's<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.239> lot<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.450> amazing<00:02:53.810> things

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
does but there's a lot of amazing things

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.199 
does but there's a lot of amazing things
coming<00:02:54.709> out<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.950> expansion<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.549> some<00:02:56.090> of

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
coming out in the expansion that some of

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.539 
coming out in the expansion that some of
which<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.450> got<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.690> check<00:02:56.870> out<00:02:57.019> at<00:02:57.230> pax<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.220> like

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
which I got to check out at pax and like

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.630 
which I got to check out at pax and like

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the housing or the bad the dimensions

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910

that<00:03:04.220> are<00:03:04.310> coming<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.700> game<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.060> look

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
that are coming to the game that look

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.830 
that are coming to the game that look
pretty<00:03:05.630> amazing<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.459> guess<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.690> don't

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
pretty amazing but I I guess I don't

game<00:07:04.699> from<00:07:05.120> Daisy<00:07:05.949> quite<00:07:06.949> a<00:07:06.979> bit<00:07:07.070> actually<00:07:07.280> and

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:08.139 
game from Daisy quite a bit actually and

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.080 
game from Daisy quite a bit actually and
even<00:07:09.139> some<00:07:09.410> of<00:07:09.440> like<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:09.860> one<00:07:10.250> thing<00:07:10.400> I<00:07:10.790> think

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
even some of like the one thing I think

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.790 
even some of like the one thing I think
from<00:07:11.300> the<00:07:11.479> photos<00:07:11.780> that<00:07:11.810> I<00:07:11.960> didn't<00:07:12.380> like<00:07:12.560> is

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
from the photos that I didn't like is

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.950 
from the photos that I didn't like is
that<00:07:13.130> when<00:07:13.669> he<00:07:13.820> would<00:07:13.970> go<00:07:14.090> down<00:07:14.210> to<00:07:14.479> pick<00:07:14.690> up<00:07:14.840> an

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 
that when he would go down to pick up an

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.740 
that when he would go down to pick up an
object<00:07:15.550> he<00:07:16.550> would<00:07:16.669> select<00:07:17.060> it<00:07:17.270> like<00:07:17.540> all

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
object he would select it like all

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.810 
object he would select it like all
objects<00:07:18.320> seem<00:07:18.470> to<00:07:18.590> have<00:07:18.740> a<00:07:18.770> highlight<00:07:19.040> and<00:07:19.520> now

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
objects seem to have a highlight and now

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.400 
objects seem to have a highlight and now
i'm<00:07:19.940> wondering<00:07:20.060> if<00:07:20.419> you're<00:07:20.600> on<00:07:20.690> hardcore<00:07:21.200> if

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
i'm wondering if you're on hardcore if

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.930 
i'm wondering if you're on hardcore if
it<00:07:21.620> would<00:07:21.740> have<00:07:21.950> a<00:07:21.979> highlight<00:07:22.400> or<00:07:22.700> if<00:07:22.790> that

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 
it would have a highlight or if that

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.280 
it would have a highlight or if that
highlight<00:07:23.270> would<00:07:23.389> be<00:07:23.510> turned<00:07:23.720> off<00:07:23.900> and<00:07:24.200> you'd

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.290 
highlight would be turned off and you'd

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.620 
highlight would be turned off and you'd
have<00:07:24.440> to<00:07:24.620> find<00:07:24.950> items<00:07:25.250> without<00:07:25.880> the<00:07:26.330> highlight

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630 
have to find items without the highlight

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.850 
have to find items without the highlight
because<00:07:26.750> the<00:07:26.900> highlight<00:07:27.200> seems<00:07:27.410> so<00:07:27.590> obvious

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:27.860 
because the highlight seems so obvious

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.560 
because the highlight seems so obvious
it<00:07:28.280> seems<00:07:28.310> like<00:07:28.669> something<00:07:29.030> from<00:07:29.150> left<00:07:29.419> for

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:29.570 
it seems like something from left for

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.520 
it seems like something from left for
