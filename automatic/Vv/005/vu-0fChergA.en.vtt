00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
over it make it slightly thicker and

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.999 
over it make it slightly thicker and
then<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.360> are<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:07.509> going<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:08.050> create<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
then you are just going to create a

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.820 
then you are just going to create a
couple<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.489> lines<00:02:09.729> coming<00:02:10.420> off<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
couple of lines coming off of it and the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.770 
couple of lines coming off of it and the
thinner<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.190> better<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.910> obviously<00:02:13.360> that's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
thinner the better but obviously that's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.699 
thinner the better but obviously that's
not<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.230> case<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.739> here<00:02:15.040> at<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.760> minute<00:02:19.709> okay

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
not the case in here at the minute okay

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.170 
not the case in here at the minute okay
so<00:02:20.769> for<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.190> next<00:02:21.220> step<00:02:21.640> you're<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.030> going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
so for the next step you're just going

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.580
