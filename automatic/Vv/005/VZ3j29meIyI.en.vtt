00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.930
 now we face on the block 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.829
 as I promised 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:11.829
 got bad will we have 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.839
 so how was the reservation made 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.029
 given to geovana old chief saucer 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.849
 I hope next year 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.849
 I witnessed the 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.269
 You'll get a chance. 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.849
 and next to muriqui 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.579
 depending on the measure 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.960
 independent of our forces 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.000
 and explains that more than half of the training sessions two of them are paulo 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.850
 then he had barely promised the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 this decade it was made from texts 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.610
 so there is a demand for this design and you will take the identical measurement and 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 How are you here? 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.570
 on here 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 we have indicatives 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 it has to fit exactly 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 in his place goes the teen series 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 you can see it coming 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 that little sense 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.630
 so will you mark 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 on here 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 but we can take as a measure that there too 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 that account does not fit into this account 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.460
 the tip of the beak exactly here 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.330
 and points from the other will be here no people 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.930
 It's what you're going to do, you'll meditate on your assumptions. 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.260
 and you will see more or less than this drawing here that was behind you then 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.960
 you will measure 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960
 example in this case of theft or 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.980
 then you will take this copy she has to have to that extent that gives some 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.409
 centimeters 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.409
 and then the deck is what's going to happen right on Easter 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.049
 I'll send you the one hundred thousand 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.049
 he goes up 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.079
 in 2007 the team andrÃ© nesi de kyle king 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.909
 they attacked 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.039
 it has to be copied onto parchment paper 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.289
 for what looks black where you will fit in your door 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 and the other for you to see well 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:43.049
 the little diguinho that directed the certain size of cut 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.569
 then that's it 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.919
 whether of a stencil shape 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.739
 have a piece of paper for you to copy this little vegetable paper 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.819
 and then you will pass the resistance tests 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.879
 it's a paper like the one you'll buy at any stationery store 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.180
 questioned 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.099
 the talc 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.499
 and then you will copy 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.900
 will take a vegetable paper to court of cheesy haia 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.849
 There you go and do it because you're capturing law. 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.889
 Then you'll put it on your back. 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.719
 if you have that quino then you will slow down magnified in the islands if you go 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.379
 expanding on her 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.230
 the order in the right measure is that you are making the vegetable paper who goes 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.929
 dance and had a clean plug 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.349
 perhaps in what he received alone 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.909
 I like this idea 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.909
 get out 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.359
 perhaps the second and a half in addition to issuing more 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:49.249
 counter facing
