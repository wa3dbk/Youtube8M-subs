00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.700 
plan a pulse on this impulsive Wednesday
November<00:00:20.760> 13th<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> moon<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.990> aries<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
November 13th with the moon in aries the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.980 
November 13th with the moon in aries the
moon<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.400> goes<00:00:23.670> into<00:00:23.880> Aries<00:00:24.330> doesn't

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
moon as it goes into Aries doesn't

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.099 
moon as it goes into Aries doesn't
always<00:00:25.380> make<00:00:26.039> us<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.730> things<00:00:26.869> but<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
always make us do things but it

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
always make us do things but it
certainly<00:00:28.410> encourages<00:00:29.220> us<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:30.000> about

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
certainly encourages us to think about

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
certainly encourages us to think about
it<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> feel<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.980> something<00:00:32.520> happens

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it to feel it's like something happens

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.020 
it to feel it's like something happens
and<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.480> emotions<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.950> response<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.820> come

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and my emotions my my response can come

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880 
and my emotions my my response can come
right<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> surface<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.320> yet<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
right up to the surface and yet it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
right up to the surface and yet it
doesn't<00:00:38.070> mean<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> i<00:00:38.760> necessarily<00:00:39.000> express

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
doesn't mean that i necessarily express

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
doesn't mean that i necessarily express
it<00:00:39.930> outwardly<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.829> Aries<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> sign<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it outwardly because Aries is a sign of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110 
it outwardly because Aries is a sign of
spontaneity<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.079> emotions<00:00:44.040> arise<00:00:44.610> very

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
spontaneity so emotions arise very

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.450 
spontaneity so emotions arise very
quickly<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.140> Aries<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> also<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> sign

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
quickly but because Aries is also a sign

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.869 
quickly but because Aries is also a sign
of<00:00:47.750> Independence<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> singularity<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.950> agree

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
of Independence and singularity I agree

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
of Independence and singularity I agree
with<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> Rick<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.690> might<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.110> necessarily

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
with you Rick we might not necessarily

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
with you Rick we might not necessarily
want<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.160> discuss<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:53.879> feelings<00:00:54.360> about

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
want to discuss those feelings about

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
want to discuss those feelings about
none<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.199> business<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> funny<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.850> damn

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
none of your business it is funny a damn

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
none of your business it is funny a damn
business<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.260> him<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.190> my

feeling<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.449> what's<00:01:00.629> interesting

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
feeling but you know what's interesting

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
feeling but you know what's interesting
today<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.370> mean<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.640> still<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.300> Sun

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
today is that mean we still have the Sun

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
today is that mean we still have the Sun
and<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> bunch<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> planets<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.799> Scorpio<00:01:05.339> which

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and a bunch of planets in Scorpio which

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
and a bunch of planets in Scorpio which
is<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.750> more<00:01:07.280> compulsive<00:01:08.280> rather<00:01:08.520> than

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
is much more compulsive rather than

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
is much more compulsive rather than
impulsive<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.780> about<00:01:09.900> holding<00:01:10.710> those

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
impulsive it's more about holding those

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
impulsive it's more about holding those
feelings<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> today<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.080> moon<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.560> aries

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
feelings in and today the moon in aries

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.179 
feelings in and today the moon in aries
also<00:01:14.729> lines<00:01:15.210> up<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.780> later<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> day<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
also lines up with later in the day it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.730 
also lines up with later in the day it
lines<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.759> with<00:01:17.970> Uranus<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.560> a

lines up with Uranus which is the also a

lines up with Uranus which is the also a
spontaneous<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.790> lightning<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.960> a

spontaneous as lightning like it's a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.580 
spontaneous as lightning like it's a

sudden release of energy almost like a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.810 
sudden release of energy almost like a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
capacitor builds up a charge and then

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.600 
capacitor builds up a charge and then
goes<00:01:27.000> Kapow<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.619> moon<00:01:28.920> lines<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.460> with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
goes Kapow that that moon lines up with

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
goes Kapow that that moon lines up with
Uranus<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.150> ghosts<00:01:30.329> Kapow<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.470> also

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
Uranus and ghosts Kapow then it also

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.429 
Uranus and ghosts Kapow then it also
squares<00:01:32.520> pluto<00:01:33.390> which<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.200> powerful

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
squares pluto which is very powerful

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.160 
squares pluto which is very powerful
these<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> late<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> day<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> lot<00:01:37.140> of

these are late in the day but a lot of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.230 
these are late in the day but a lot of
that<00:01:37.439> areas<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> energy<00:01:38.430> today<00:01:38.670> during<00:01:39.030> the

that areas of energy today during the
day<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.600> stirring<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.590> these<00:01:40.799> issues<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
day is stirring up these issues of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
day is stirring up these issues of
what's<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.299> difference<00:01:42.659> between<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
what's the difference between what I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.710 
what's the difference between what I
feel<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:44.729> react<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
feel and how you might react to what I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.749 
feel and how you might react to what I
feel<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> guts<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> tell<00:01:47.520> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
feel if I have the guts to tell you

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
feel if I have the guts to tell you
which<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.240> don't<00:01:48.299> oh<00:01:48.720> good<00:01:49.079> way<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.950> while

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
which I don't oh good way and and while

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
which I don't oh good way and and while
tonight<00:01:50.790> might<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.210> characterized<00:01:52.049> by<00:01:52.229> some

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
tonight might be characterized by some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
tonight might be characterized by some
explosive<00:01:53.220> emotions<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> positive

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
explosive emotions I think the positive

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.590 
explosive emotions I think the positive
use<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> pie<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.090> moon<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.509> the

use of the pie the moon in the
pioneering<00:01:58.110> sign<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.710> Aries<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.430> to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.600> more

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
pioneering sign of Aries is to be more

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
pioneering sign of Aries is to be more
present<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.829> recognize<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.640> we've<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.450> to
