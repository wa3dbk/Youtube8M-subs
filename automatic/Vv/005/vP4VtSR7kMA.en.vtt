taking<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.810> lot<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:01.770> doing<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.099> and<00:02:02.369> I

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
taking a lot of time doing that and I

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.309 
taking a lot of time doing that and I
added<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.880> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> poison<00:02:03.869> plum<00:02:04.080> from

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
added a little bit of poison plum from

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.740 
added a little bit of poison plum from
sugarpill<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.890> well<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:06.240> kind<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.599> that

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
sugarpill as well to kind of get that

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.449 
sugarpill as well to kind of get that
transition<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.560> work<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> way<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
transition to work with the way that I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.370 
transition to work with the way that I
wanted<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.049> little<00:02:10.170> bit<00:02:10.319> of

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
wanted it to and to have a little bit of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.220 
wanted it to and to have a little bit of
depth<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:15.420> using<00:02:15.599> wet<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.080> wild

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
depth there now I'm using wet and wild

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.460 
depth there now I'm using wet and wild
black<00:02:16.980> cream<00:02:17.489> eyeliner<00:02:18.239> I'm<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.200> one's<00:02:19.380> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
black cream eyeliner I'm the one's a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.620 
black cream eyeliner I'm the one's a
little<00:02:19.560> hot<00:02:20.010> we're<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:20.790> kind<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.120> outlining

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
little hot we're just kind of outlining

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.710 
little hot we're just kind of outlining
that<00:02:21.810> shape<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.530> I've<00:02:22.620> mapped<00:02:22.829> out<00:02:23.069> earlier

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that shape that I've mapped out earlier

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.009 
that shape that I've mapped out earlier
try<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.780> dissipate<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:27.019> really

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
try to dissipate as you can and really

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.380 
try to dissipate as you can and really
make<00:02:28.950> your<00:02:29.099> lines<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.730> straight<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.150> can't

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
make your lines that straight you can't

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.690 
make your lines that straight you can't
I<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:30.660> that's<00:02:30.810> probably<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.349> hardest

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
I think that's probably the hardest

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.190 
I think that's probably the hardest
hardest<00:02:32.700> part<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.209> look<00:02:33.359> actually<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.049> get

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
hardest part of look actually is to get

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
hardest part of look actually is to get
straight<00:02:35.040> lines<00:02:35.069> even<00:02:35.549> if<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.940> something

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
straight lines even if it's something

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.059 
straight lines even if it's something
simple<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> shape<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.500> pretty<00:02:37.709> simple

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
simple like the shape is pretty simple

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.759 
simple like the shape is pretty simple
when<00:02:38.970> you're<00:02:39.150> trying<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.079> get<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.319> perfectly

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
when you're trying to get it perfectly

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.590 
when you're trying to get it perfectly
symmetrical<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.640> kind<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.000> difficult<00:02:42.150> so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
symmetrical it's kind of difficult so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.370 
symmetrical it's kind of difficult so
just<00:02:42.810> take<00:02:42.989> your<00:02:43.019> time

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
just take your time

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.580 
just take your time
and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.420 
and
should<00:02:45.220> come<00:02:45.340> out<00:02:45.489> good<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:46.349> well<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.950> now<00:02:54.220> I'm

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
should come out good or well and now I'm

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.920 
should come out good or well and now I'm
mapping<00:02:54.880> out<00:02:55.000> where<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> want<00:02:55.390> my<00:02:55.480> little<00:02:55.599> wings
