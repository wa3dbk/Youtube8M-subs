for founding this stunt will go to him
but<00:00:33.270> their<00:00:33.360> way<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.870> guys<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
but their way so as you guys can see I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
but their way so as you guys can see I
have<00:00:34.559> gone<00:00:34.680> ahead<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:34.920> placed<00:00:35.250> out<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.610> couple

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
have gone ahead and placed out a couple

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.190 
have gone ahead and placed out a couple
of<00:00:36.000> boosters<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> don't

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of boosters right here because I don't

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500 
of boosters right here because I don't
think<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> will<00:00:38.460> need<00:00:38.610> too<00:00:38.940> much<00:00:39.149> speed

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
think that we will need too much speed

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.180 
think that we will need too much speed
going<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> wall<00:00:40.440> right<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.040> see

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
top of the parking garage again or even

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.600 
top of the parking garage again or even
better<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> inside<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
better if you make it inside of the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
better if you make it inside of the
parking<00:00:57.030> garage<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> race<00:00:57.600> let's<00:00:57.809> go

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
parking garage but the race let's go

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
parking garage but the race let's go
ahead<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.170> give<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:58.859> try<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.699> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
ahead and give it a first try here so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.779 
ahead and give it a first try here so
let's<00:01:00.840> try<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.410> off<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.770> ramp<00:01:02.100> perfectly

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
let's try to go off this ramp perfectly

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.289 
let's try to go off this ramp perfectly
there<00:01:03.090> we<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:05.159> think<00:01:05.640> oh<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> was

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
there we go and I think oh that was

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
there we go and I think oh that was
pretty<00:01:06.540> close<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.290> did<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> edge<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
pretty close we just did the edge on the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
pretty close we just did the edge on the
top<00:01:08.520> okay<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.689> attempt<00:01:10.140> number<00:01:10.320> two<00:01:10.680> I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
top okay here we go attempt number two I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
top okay here we go attempt number two I
don't<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> use<00:01:12.180> any<00:01:12.420> boosters

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
don't think we need to use any boosters

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.980 
don't think we need to use any boosters
and<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:14.340> might<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.689> I'm<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and I might use one like when I'm in the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
and I might use one like when I'm in the
middle<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> worldwide<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.939> going

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
middle of the worldwide if it's going

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060 
middle of the worldwide if it's going
too<00:01:18.360> slow<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
too slow but I do not think that it's

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.460 
too slow but I do not think that it's
necessary<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:20.970> anyways<00:01:21.210> let's<00:01:21.840> let's<00:01:22.290> pick

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
necessary but anyways let's let's pick

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
necessary but anyways let's let's pick
up<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> booster<00:01:23.070> anyways<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> let's<00:01:23.970> try<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
up a booster anyways and let's try to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.020 
up a booster anyways and let's try to
hit<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.900> jump<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.650> we're<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> hit

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
hit this jump and we're going to hit

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.080 
hit this jump and we're going to hit
that<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.619> then<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.740> blow<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:28.950> anyways<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.970> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that and then we blow up anyways as I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
let's just try to use a boost one time

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.289 
let's just try to use a boost one time
and<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:56.640> too<00:01:56.700> fast

back I just had some awesome pizza and

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.800

as<00:06:04.610> you<00:06:04.760> guys<00:06:04.880> can<00:06:04.970> see<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.180> have<00:06:05.450> also<00:06:05.630> gone

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
as you guys can see I have also gone

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.140 
as you guys can see I have also gone
ahead<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.140> changed<00:06:06.470> my<00:06:06.620> car<00:06:06.890> to<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.640> center

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
ahead and changed my car to the center

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.970 
ahead and changed my car to the center
nose<00:06:08.390> so<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:08.990> do<00:06:09.170> not<00:06:09.410> know<00:06:09.500> if<00:06:09.650> it<00:06:09.740> will<00:06:09.860> make

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
nose so I do not know if it will make

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.890 
nose so I do not know if it will make
any<00:06:10.190> difference<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.910> this<00:06:11.210> car<00:06:11.480> does<00:06:11.690> have

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
any difference and this car does have

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.080 
any difference and this car does have
some<00:06:12.110> better<00:06:12.290> acceleration<00:06:12.710> so<00:06:13.700> maybe<00:06:13.910> that

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
some better acceleration so maybe that

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.150 
some better acceleration so maybe that
will<00:06:14.180> make<00:06:14.240> it<00:06:14.480> easier<00:06:14.870> but<00:06:14.900> anyways<00:06:15.260> let's<00:06:15.980> go

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
will make it easier but anyways let's go

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.720 
will make it easier but anyways let's go
ahead<00:06:16.220> and<00:06:16.370> see<00:06:16.580> here<00:06:16.970> so<00:06:17.360> let's<00:06:17.630> hit<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:17.990> ramp

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
ahead and see here so let's hit the ramp

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.340 
ahead and see here so let's hit the ramp
and<00:06:19.730> let's<00:06:19.910> turn<00:06:20.240> and<00:06:20.570> this<00:06:20.750> car<00:06:20.990> is<00:06:21.110> not<00:06:21.230> as

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
and let's turn and this car is not as

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.350 
and let's turn and this car is not as
fast<00:06:21.560> as<00:06:21.740> my<00:06:21.920> adder<00:06:22.130> because<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.670> had<00:06:22.820> a<00:06:22.850> custom

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
fast as my adder because I had a custom

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.570 
fast as my adder because I had a custom
adder<00:06:23.540> previously<00:06:24.500> so<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:24.800> car<00:06:25.040> won't<00:06:25.220> be<00:06:25.340> as

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
adder previously so this car won't be as

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.270 
adder previously so this car won't be as
fast<00:06:25.910> but<00:06:26.120> anyways<00:06:26.390> I<00:06:26.660> see<00:06:27.380> this<00:06:27.440> jump<00:06:27.830> there

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
fast but anyways I see this jump there

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.230 
fast but anyways I see this jump there
we<00:06:28.430> go<00:06:29.050> landed<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.200> yes<00:06:30.890> yes<00:06:32.770> no<00:06:33.770> we<00:06:34.760> still<00:06:35.060> need

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
we go landed it yes yes no we still need

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.000 
we go landed it yes yes no we still need
to<00:06:35.360> cross<00:06:35.600> this<00:06:35.870> one<00:06:36.050> I<00:06:36.110> have<00:06:36.320> no<00:06:36.470> idea<00:06:36.770> what

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
to cross this one I have no idea what

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.500 
to cross this one I have no idea what
we're<00:06:37.190> doing<00:06:37.310> wrong<00:06:37.610> if<00:06:37.790> we<00:06:37.820> go<00:06:38.030> in<00:06:38.150> too<00:06:38.270> fast

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
we're doing wrong if we go in too fast

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.020 
we're doing wrong if we go in too fast
if<00:06:38.930> we're<00:06:39.170> going<00:06:39.440> too<00:06:39.560> slow<00:06:39.950> I<00:06:39.980> have<00:06:40.340> no<00:06:40.580> idea

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
if we're going too slow I have no idea

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.450 
if we're going too slow I have no idea
but<00:06:41.240> anyways<00:06:41.540> let's<00:06:42.470> try<00:06:42.770> it<00:06:42.830> some<00:06:43.070> more<00:06:43.220> so

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
but anyways let's try it some more so

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.110 
but anyways let's try it some more so
here<00:06:43.610> we<00:06:43.730> go

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
here we go

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.480 
here we go
nope<00:06:44.870> okay<00:06:45.110> guys<00:06:45.560> so<00:06:45.680> I<00:06:45.740> think<00:06:45.830> that<00:06:46.340> I<00:06:46.400> have

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
nope okay guys so I think that I have

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.190 
nope okay guys so I think that I have
figured<00:06:46.700> it<00:06:46.910> out<00:06:46.940> all<00:06:47.480> we<00:06:47.570> need<00:06:47.690> to<00:06:47.780> do<00:06:47.870> is<00:06:48.020> just

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
figured it out all we need to do is just

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.100 
figured it out all we need to do is just
go<00:06:48.410> a<00:06:48.440> bit<00:06:48.710> slower<00:06:49.060> over<00:06:50.060> those<00:06:50.240> gaps<00:06:50.630> and<00:06:50.930> then

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
go a bit slower over those gaps and then

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.780 
go a bit slower over those gaps and then
we<00:06:51.260> should<00:06:51.320> be<00:06:51.710> able<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.010> make<00:06:52.220> it<00:06:52.400> so<00:06:52.520> let's<00:06:52.700> go

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
we should be able to make it so let's go

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.760 
we should be able to make it so let's go
and<00:06:52.910> slow<00:06:53.150> down<00:06:53.360> here<00:06:53.600> and<00:06:54.320> let's<00:06:54.530> make<00:06:54.590> the

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
and slow down here and let's make the

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.570 
and slow down here and let's make the
first<00:06:54.950> one

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
first one

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.670 
first one
keep<00:06:55.910> going<00:06:56.240> slow<00:06:56.510> okay<00:06:56.930> maybe<00:06:57.140> not<00:06:57.260> that<00:06:57.320> slow

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
keep going slow okay maybe not that slow

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.440 
keep going slow okay maybe not that slow
yes<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.010> video<00:06:58.190> there<00:06:58.370> we<00:06:58.430> go<00:06:58.550> use<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.300> boost

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
yes the video there we go use the boost

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.250 
yes the video there we go use the boost
use<00:06:59.630> the<00:06:59.750> boost<00:06:59.930> oh<00:07:01.600> that<00:07:02.600> was<00:07:02.720> so<00:07:02.900> close

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
use the boost oh that was so close

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.710 
use the boost oh that was so close
that<00:07:03.860> was<00:07:04.040> super<00:07:04.520> close<00:07:04.700> guys<00:07:05.030> we<00:07:05.480> are

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
that was super close guys we are

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.780
