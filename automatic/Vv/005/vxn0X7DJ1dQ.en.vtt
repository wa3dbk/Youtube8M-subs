00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to tenderize this system and all this is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000 
to tenderize this system and all this is
it's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> serrated<00:01:00.030> set<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> blades<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.829> we

it's a serrated set of blades and as we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.500 
it's a serrated set of blades and as we
use<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.340> I'll<00:01:02.579> show<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.850> exactly<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.300> it

use this I'll show you exactly how it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.840 
use this I'll show you exactly how it
works<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.559> deployed<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.250> set<00:01:05.729> of

across the surface and it can use

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
across the surface and it can use
multiple<00:01:12.479> times<00:01:12.750> multiple<00:01:13.439> angles<00:01:13.830> multiple

texture so as you can see all going to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
texture so as you can see all going to
do<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> take<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.150> tool<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.320> run<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> right

do is take this tool and run it right
across<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.060> meat<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> push<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
across this meat so as I push down on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
across this meat so as I push down on
there<00:01:26.189> those<00:01:26.430> blades<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:27.030> being<00:01:27.210> deployed

it's<00:03:19.489> like<00:03:19.639> this<00:03:19.819> system<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.930> eventually

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:21.259 
it's like this system and eventually
