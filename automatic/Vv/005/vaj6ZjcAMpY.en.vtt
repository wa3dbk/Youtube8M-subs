00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.620
 ok let's see how this goes like this 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.540
 girl, this is the thousand 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.559
 wonders because as you can see in 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.190
 screen 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 my new console has just arrived 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.480
 Playstation 3 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.270
 the 250 gb edition as seen here with 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.520
 my crime 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.670
 is new model this the super slim that 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.490
 came out recently 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.640
 and it caught my attention because this one 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.270
 comes with four games that are tiny 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.739
 1 and 2 in addition to the 10 if festival 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.720
 blogs and the public uncharted too 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.770
 although 'without 10 and I do not know if these games 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.180
 yes it will 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.850
 ah 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.860
 and other than as the box says there is a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 good percentage of savings to buy it 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.670
 all alone 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.670
 well let's see what the box has 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.479
 inside the box 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.290
 another box 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.610
 where does the solar console come from 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.950
 has play station network for reducer 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.369
 of bluray obviously 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.750
 to watch movies in 3-d and that is a 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.649
 250 gigabyte console let's see how it 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.649
 open this 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.270
 we go to the field with the camera 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.320
 the first 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 buttons 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.410
 wireless here 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.540
 the power cable 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 audio video cable which we are going to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.010
 discard because on an HDMI cable 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.010
 which is not included with the console 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.010
 but 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.400
 that if they gave me in the store I would 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.400
 present 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:47.980
 and a usb cable that I guess is for 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.980
 load the control 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.220
 here is the good 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 good 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.930
 let's see 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.930
 care here 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.730
 Salt 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.190
 Paris 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 with this new 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.880
 very well saw it the reverse 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.020
 this is the first ps3 that I bought 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.270
 but I have seen the others 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.500
 quite bigger and more 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.500
 they are heavier than these 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.840
 protective plastic that I have here 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.289
 or 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.660
 the disc tray for obviously the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.660
 playstation games 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.360
 so that this 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.310
 we started off super well because the coat in 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.310
 the hand is called the h 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.729
 here is the power button the button 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.729
 to open the tray 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.909
 the usb ports 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.680
 behind 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.460
 in the harbor 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.910
 In Internet 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.800
 port hdmi digital output output 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.800
 audio video and power output 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.260
 and I promised it to the box 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.260
 and sick 1 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:47.370
 and we were two with a super cover 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.370
 original is equal to that of 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.160
 is 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.520
 sforza 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.520
 only on playstation 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.350
 uncharted 2 edition game of the year very 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.560
 well I do not know what will be special here 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.560
 He says 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:17.560
 in multiplayer cooperative mode in the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.950
 maps and characters 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.950
 and an animated comic book and I liked it 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.680
 it comes too 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:34.480
 manual I guess so 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.480
 of a membership for a month 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.910
 Y 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.080
 the manuals and 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.080
 little things of rigor 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.370
 they are the new 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.759
 everything that this pack brings 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.850
 I hope that if you have the opportunity and not 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:02.220
 they have a playstation 3 that is a 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.700
 good option to buy it because 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:09.190
 come four games that according to laws 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.330
 specialized press of video games are 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.730
 very good 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.870
 all have scores over 9 points of 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:19.030
 10 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:21.129
 and that of watching movies in blu-ray with 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.500
 this thing 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:26.090
 very well 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.630
 I hope they take good care of us and we
