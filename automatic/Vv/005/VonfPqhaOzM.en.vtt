00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.180
 good 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.100
 or the one that they release and that in this 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.800
 occasion we will show how to install 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.070
 a custom room based on android 4.4 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.630
 points 2 for samsung galaxy s 4 mini 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.130
 the gti version and 91 95 l to be able 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.870
 be to what is right in recovery 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.940
 previously you must have rooted 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.920
 what is the equipment and install what is 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 the custom recovery for that we already have 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.280
 a video that I leave it here for 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.930
 they can come and they can rootear you 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.330
 do all the steps to be able to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.199
 successfully install what is being 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.809
 fair 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.550
 for this there will be two files one 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.739
 which is the rom and the other that are the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.239
 google apps very well for this what 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.909
 we have here in what is the desktop 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.020
 you can not see well there is like 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.580
 can see what we have in what is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.350
 desk what are we going to go to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.940
 then it is to connect what is 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.640
 the computer the computer to be able 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.520
 pass these two files and be able to 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 continue with what is the installation 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.670
 more so that I know it once today 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.799
 recognized let's copy the two 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.960
 files in the phone's memory 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.600
 we give here to open the phone number 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.490
 we put what are the two files 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 we have to finish here is a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 little pesadito well then we are going to 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 pass what is the video nothing else for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.220
 that what you finish copying and if you already 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 we return with good installation because 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.890
 they have passed what are the files to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.720
 What we are going to do next is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.520
 turn off the computer 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.950
 here we will turn it off and enter what 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.020
 is the mode recover the recovers mode with 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 the top button keys home and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 poor at the same time 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.320
 for this equipment to turn off to 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.100
 to be able to continue with what the list 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.100
 of kurt shoulder 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.380
 to see is a pretty light rumba this 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.750
 It is the first time we will try 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.490
 we have already seen in another side type is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.620
 well it looks pretty good it promises that 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.810
 It is very light for this team if 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.610
 cut this equipment so fast that it 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.740
 supposes that with this course to create much 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.120
 faster very well it would be off 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.980
 in everything while we are recovering 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.720
 I respect you again the volume above 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 home and poor at the same time 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.870
 the degree release them and as you can see 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.980
 the channel of legends and you can enter 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.980
 what is in record mode 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.460
 and to be able to install what is the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.460
 shoulder first you have to do is 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.230
 give us white da tan factors set this one goes 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.240
 to erase all memory files 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.860
 all all contacts therefore they 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.630
 I recommend before doing all the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.650
 steps you can do what that backup 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.640
 first white data to the wct tour with the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.200
 center button and we confirm you 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.530
 when they are cleaning what is the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.530
 team 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.980
 in a corner of cleaned of what is 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.440
 wait for the cip 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.430
 and we are going to give you your reports of 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.140
 character the first option 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.790
 we give it back to the first option and 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.780
 we look for the Rome that in this case 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.780
 wv pm 11 and here is 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.190
 to confirmation 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.600
 and here they lie, cutting down what is so much 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.100
 once you have finished installing 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 this breaks what we see next 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.960
 are activities that are in this case the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 play thor and I think rather some 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.150
 others 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.689
 what are the basic ones to be able to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.689
 use it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.870
 settle here 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.620
 you will leave the video because I want to see what 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.900
 that they see every step that we are going to have 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.770
 another version so that it does not get confused 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.770
 part behind the wheel 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.290
 again so good an apology for 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.730
 by the noises that there is music or some 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.190
 strange noise that can be heard by 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.350
 there because there's a party in my house for 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.090
 so I can not help it 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.849
 here we have installing what this 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.050
 package but 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:26.360
 a little more and the video since I do not want 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.220
 that evening too much at the time 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.159
 that ends we go back to show how 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.259
 are the guides, well, here 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.240
 finished what is the installation here 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.250
 fit in vertices such kart fornÃ©s 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.319
 complete now let's clarify what is 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.389
 the guide is a similar process what 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.610
 We did with the rom let's go to the tiger nut and 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.069
 flourishes from here we give the first 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.430
 option and we choose now the idea is that 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.440
 the apps here here signet points and you 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.690
 we give with the central button we are going to 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.009
 install and there it is already finished 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.120
 install what are all google to 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.949
 94 forgiveness of 44.2 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.650
 and this mode install with the blue bar 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.240
 as first that installing when 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.340
 this one ends then we should have 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.870
 finished with the installation the only thing 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.880
 that we have to restart the phone to 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.860
 who can see that we already have 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.860
 android 4.4 points 2 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.830
 very well here we already finished therefore 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.089
 with the key and more let's go back and you 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.429
 let's give what is the first option 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.669
 that says system but in redwood system 

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.669
 now 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.490
 it is already restarting what is the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.550
 team and it should be restarted well 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.050
 with what is different from what we are 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.850
 accustomed you should not start with what 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.240
 what is the custom recovery that in this 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.250
 case that angel mode if it is not wrong 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.630
 but with the custom room company that as 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.509
 can see if it is indeed a 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.520
 elder fed mont based on android 4.4 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.110
 points as you know that normally 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.490
 first beginnings in the phones every 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.830
 Once we install a new rom 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.000
 well a little late since it has 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.740
 have to load all the files that are 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.050
 all the modifications that were 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.430
 we did and so good at this moment what 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.199
 let's see again pause the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.520
 video so that it does not stretch so long and 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.949
 when rain and when it starts 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.599
 completely because then we will continue 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.440
 giving what is this little review that 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.060
 let's see it 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 well here as you can see it has already 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.300
 rebooted what is the team we are 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.700
 on the screen it start 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.960
 cyanogenmod to configure it and then 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.670
 good it resets approximately 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.040
 after about two minutes after 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.360
 we passed the video then in this case 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.090
 let's put what is in Spanish in 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.340
 usa we give you next next in this 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.500
 good case in this case then we are going to 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.210
 issue some small parts then for 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.180
 make it fast this little video we 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.110
 omit here we will see that we are not left 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.640
 we do not give it to next - well that already 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.810
 you can configure later you 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.270
 today will have more let's do it for 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.880
 I can show you what this course is 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.010
 in recovery quickly as they can 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.590
 measure is welcoming us 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.020
 to the team and well as you can see here already 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.730
 you can see that we already have what it is 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.680
 android kitkat as you can - go out all 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.630
 those who leave normally welcome 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.240
 and everything as you can see here we already have 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.340
 guides that are the play store / mail the 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.100
 sangha outs in the voice search the 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.480
 search bar in the same way and then 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.910
 to confirm good that is already 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.010
 android 4.4 points we go to configuration 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.290
 let's go to the bottom we're going 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.220
 about the device and here as 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.460
 can see we already have 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.890
 is the gt version and 91-95 in this case 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.860
 for being custom we do not take off the letter 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.290
 l and for the rom version of android 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.550
 forgiveness 4.4 points 2 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.260
 palmer the one that we keep tight comes out 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.270
 android 4.4 point 2 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.130
 let's keep it tight and we get 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.740
 all versions of what they have already 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.720
 existed and how can you see well 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.880
 this is a video as you can see 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.130
 pretty fast very simple without any 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.900
 problem to be able to install this rom and 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.700
 Well that was all for this little 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.100
 video I hope you have served them I hope 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.230
 can successfully update their 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.680
