your left analog stick now to lead your
wide<00:02:08.220> receiver<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.440> big<00:02:10.679> change

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
wide receiver so that's a big change

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.690

it's gonna get away it's gonna take

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.070 
it's gonna get away it's gonna take
while<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.060> get<00:02:13.150> used<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.840> took<00:02:14.020> me

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
while to get used to that it took me

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.699 
while to get used to that it took me
probably<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.800> good<00:02:14.980> game<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.580> realize<00:02:15.849> okay

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
probably a good game to realize okay

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.020 
probably a good game to realize okay
this<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:17.920> part<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.849> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
this is just part of it this is the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.580 
this is just part of it this is the
change<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.930> how<00:02:20.050> they're<00:02:20.290> trying<00:02:20.500> to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
change this is how they're trying to

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.309 
change this is how they're trying to
prove<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> passing<00:02:21.550> game<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.200> could

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
prove the passing game I think it could

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.809 
prove the passing game I think it could
be<00:02:23.440> something<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.069> better<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.610> have

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
be something for the better but I have

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.339 
be something for the better but I have
to<00:02:24.970> wait<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.450> kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> like<00:02:26.170> having

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
to wait and see I kind of like having

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.600 
to wait and see I kind of like having
total<00:02:26.650> control<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.370> little<00:02:27.519> bit

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
total control so it's a little bit

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880 
total control so it's a little bit
strange<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.090> me<00:02:28.209> just<00:02:28.480> press<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> button<00:02:29.500> and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
strange for me just press a button and

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.979 
strange for me just press a button and
just<00:02:30.400> kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.730> hold<00:02:30.940> back<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:31.810> just

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
just kind of hold back and then just

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.290 
just kind of hold back and then just
read<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.349> defense<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:33.190> guess<00:02:33.849> as<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> small

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
read the defense I guess as a small

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.430 
read the defense I guess as a small

especially if it's a demo most people
are<00:04:12.459> going<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.639> download<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.090> demo<00:04:13.299> are

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389

probably<00:04:13.630> more<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.900> your<00:04:14.019> hardcore<00:04:14.380> fans

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
probably more of your hardcore fans

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.729 
probably more of your hardcore fans
anyway<00:04:15.099> so<00:04:15.250> why<00:04:16.120> not<00:04:16.150> quite<00:04:17.049> have<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.349> demo

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
anyway so why not quite have the demo

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.259 
anyway so why not quite have the demo
and<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:17.979> harder<00:04:18.220> difficulty<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.910> know<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.209> that

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
and a harder difficulty you know so that

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.290 
and a harder difficulty you know so that
way<00:04:19.539> you<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.500> get<00:04:21.190> people<00:04:21.579> excited<00:04:21.669> about<00:04:22.090> the

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
way you can get people excited about the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.490 
way you can get people excited about the
game<00:04:22.330> because<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.810> games<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.140> little<00:04:23.380> bit

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
game because of the games a little bit

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.960 
game because of the games a little bit
of<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.620> challenge<00:04:23.919> in<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> demo<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.760> think

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
of a challenge in the demo I think

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.870 
of a challenge in the demo I think
people<00:04:25.090> reading<00:04:25.479> more

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
people reading more

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.030 
people reading more

talk<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.430> little<00:04:43.550> bit<00:04:43.790> about<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.060> running<00:04:44.300> game

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
talk a little bit about the running game

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.940 
talk a little bit about the running game
the<00:04:44.840> big<00:04:44.960> thing<00:04:45.170> with<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.350> running<00:04:45.500> game<00:04:45.590> is

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
the big thing with the running game is

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.680 
the big thing with the running game is
the<00:04:46.340> animations<00:04:46.790> are<00:04:46.910> the<00:04:47.000> same<00:04:47.180> basically

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
the animations are the same basically

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.680 
the animations are the same basically
but<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:49.370> biggest<00:04:49.610> difference<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.390> the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
but the biggest difference is the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.050 
but the biggest difference is the
trenches<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.920> have<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.580> noticed<00:04:52.940> any

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
trenches I have not noticed any

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.450 
trenches I have not noticed any
difference<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:54.170> blocking<00:04:54.650> animations<00:04:55.280> look

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
difference the blocking animations look

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.310 
difference the blocking animations look
exactly<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.090> same<00:04:56.210> from<00:04:56.540> last<00:04:56.630> year<00:04:57.110> and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
exactly the same from last year and

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.870 
exactly the same from last year and
that's<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.680> little<00:04:57.770> bit<00:04:58.010> frustrating<00:04:58.610> used<00:04:58.790> to

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
that's a little bit frustrating used to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.620 
that's a little bit frustrating used to
be<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.480> this<00:04:59.660> whole<00:05:00.490> it's<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.610> same<00:05:01.820> one<00:05:02.360> two

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
be it's this whole it's the same one two

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.690 
be it's this whole it's the same one two
animations<00:05:03.020> we've<00:05:03.410> seen<00:05:03.680> every<00:05:04.160> year<00:05:04.490> and

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
animations we've seen every year and

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.340 
animations we've seen every year and
it's<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:05.270> little<00:05:05.510> bit<00:05:05.600> old<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:06.050> would<00:05:06.110> like<00:05:06.320> to

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
it's a little bit old I would like to

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.230 
it's a little bit old I would like to
see<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.770> vastly<00:05:07.310> improved<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.910> little<00:05:08.030> bit

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
see that vastly improved a little bit

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.670 
see that vastly improved a little bit
more<00:05:08.360> of<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.540> struggle<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.020> trenches<00:05:09.470> I

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
more of a struggle in the trenches I

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.070 
more of a struggle in the trenches I
mean<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.520> me<00:05:10.640> football<00:05:10.970> is<00:05:11.180> won<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.600> lost<00:05:11.780> in

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
mean to me football is won and lost in

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.290 
mean to me football is won and lost in
the<00:05:12.200> trenches<00:05:12.590> so<00:05:12.800> why<00:05:13.040> not<00:05:13.310> fix<00:05:13.700> that<00:05:14.000> first

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
the trenches so why not fix that first

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.300 
the trenches so why not fix that first
before<00:05:14.540> you<00:05:14.840> fix<00:05:15.080> anything<00:05:15.410> else<00:05:15.770> that's<00:05:16.040> just

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
before you fix anything else that's just

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.880 
before you fix anything else that's just
my<00:05:16.550> thought<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.090> maybe<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.110> am<00:05:18.350> just<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.740> retard

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
my thought and maybe I am just a retard

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.970 
my thought and maybe I am just a retard
I'll<00:05:19.400> reap<00:05:19.850> pod<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:21.440> don't<00:05:21.710> know<00:05:21.770> what<00:05:21.890> else

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
I'll reap pod and I don't know what else

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.860 
I'll reap pod and I don't know what else
to<00:05:22.100> say<00:05:22.370> but<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:22.850> don't<00:05:23.240> know<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.630> would<00:05:23.750> have

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
to say but I don't know it would have

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.360 
to say but I don't know it would have
been<00:05:23.930> nice<00:05:24.140> to<00:05:24.170> see<00:05:24.530> an<00:05:24.680> improvement<00:05:24.800> in<00:05:25.280> the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
been nice to see an improvement in the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.160 
been nice to see an improvement in the
trenches<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:25.910> little<00:05:26.150> bit<00:05:26.270> better<00:05:26.390> animations

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
trenches a little bit better animations

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.070 
trenches a little bit better animations
down<00:05:27.470> there<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:28.070> mean<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:29.180> passing<00:05:29.630> games<00:05:29.810> nice

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
down there I mean the passing games nice

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.440 
down there I mean the passing games nice
but<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.740> know<00:05:31.430> let's<00:05:31.610> try<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.880> balance<00:05:32.090> it<00:05:32.360> out

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
but you know let's try to balance it out

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.910 
but you know let's try to balance it out
a<00:05:32.510> little<00:05:32.690> bit<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:32.960> think<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.440> mean<00:05:33.560> look<00:05:33.680> at<00:05:33.740> this

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
a little bit I think I mean look at this

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.100 
a little bit I think I mean look at this
I<00:05:34.190> mean<00:05:34.760> offensive<00:05:35.480> lineman<00:05:35.780> just<00:05:35.930> kind<00:05:36.080> of

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
I mean offensive lineman just kind of

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.700 
I mean offensive lineman just kind of
stepping<00:05:36.350> back<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.890> there<00:05:37.760> I<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:39.170> normally

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
stepping back and there I that normally

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.230 
stepping back and there I that normally
in<00:05:39.800> the<00:05:39.890> past<00:05:40.160> would<00:05:40.400> probably<00:05:40.820> be<00:05:40.940> an

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
in the past would probably be an

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.970 
in the past would probably be an
interception<00:05:41.810> not<00:05:42.140> gonna<00:05:42.290> lie<00:05:42.440> so<00:05:42.650> that's<00:05:42.860> a

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
interception not gonna lie so that's a

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.460 
interception not gonna lie so that's a
nice<00:05:43.190> addition<00:05:43.760> you<00:05:44.570> had<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.750> double<00:05:44.960> coverage

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
nice addition you had a double coverage

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.460 
nice addition you had a double coverage
there<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:46.040> it<00:05:46.610> was<00:05:46.700> thrown<00:05:46.970> in<00:05:47.210> nicely<00:05:47.470> throw

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
there and it was thrown in nicely throw

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.550 
there and it was thrown in nicely throw
a<00:05:48.710> catch<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.670> used<00:05:50.390> to<00:05:50.450> be<00:05:50.510> in<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.690> bat<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.050> in

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
a catch and used to be in the bat and in

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.170 
a catch and used to be in the bat and in
the<00:05:51.710> past<00:05:52.010> it<00:05:52.220> used<00:05:52.310> to<00:05:52.430> be<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.670> no<00:05:52.880> look

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
the past it used to be that no look

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.090 
the past it used to be that no look
interception<00:05:53.930> to<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:54.380> so<00:05:54.470> what<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.650> has

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
interception to it and so what that has

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.680 
interception to it and so what that has
been<00:05:55.280> removed<00:05:55.520> which<00:05:55.670> is<00:05:55.790> nice<00:05:56.000> more<00:05:56.360> swats

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
been removed which is nice more swats

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.110 
been removed which is nice more swats
it's<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.350> start<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.710> turnover<00:05:58.490> oh<00:05:58.670> gee<00:05:58.910> have

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
it's the start the turnover oh gee have

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.020 
it's the start the turnover oh gee have
the<00:05:59.300> past<00:05:59.630> but<00:06:00.560> it's<00:06:01.040> not<00:06:01.220> as<00:06:01.370> significant<00:06:01.910> as

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
the past but it's not as significant as

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.150 
the past but it's not as significant as
last<00:06:02.270> year<00:06:02.480> and<00:06:02.630> speaking<00:06:03.320> of<00:06:03.410> defense<00:06:03.890> when<00:06:04.130> i

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
last year and speaking of defense when i

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.400 
last year and speaking of defense when i
was<00:06:04.400> playing<00:06:04.670> defense<00:06:05.330> i<00:06:05.660> would<00:06:06.200> have<00:06:06.290> been

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
was playing defense i would have been

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.050 
was playing defense i would have been
nice<00:06:06.620> to<00:06:06.650> have<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:07.040> little<00:06:07.130> bit<00:06:07.340> more<00:06:07.460> animation

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
nice to have a little bit more animation

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.940 
nice to have a little bit more animation
power<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.540> get<00:06:08.660> past<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.140> offensive<00:06:09.470> lineman

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
power to get past the offensive lineman

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.530 
power to get past the offensive lineman
like<00:06:10.040> a<00:06:10.070> bull<00:06:10.340> rush<00:06:10.670> or<00:06:10.940> some<00:06:11.120> kind<00:06:11.330> of<00:06:11.360> other

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
like a bull rush or some kind of other

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.940 
like a bull rush or some kind of other
movies<00:06:11.750> but<00:06:12.080> it<00:06:12.230> didn't<00:06:12.500> have<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.830> available

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
movies but it didn't have that available

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.880 
movies but it didn't have that available
so<00:06:13.910> it<00:06:14.750> just<00:06:14.780> didn't<00:06:15.260> feel<00:06:15.440> and<00:06:15.680> very

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
so it just didn't feel and very

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.730 
so it just didn't feel and very
enjoyable<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:17.180> let's<00:06:17.480> talk<00:06:17.750> about<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.320> crowd

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
enjoyable and let's talk about the crowd

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.820 
enjoyable and let's talk about the crowd
the<00:06:19.550> crowd<00:06:19.820> just<00:06:20.390> didn't<00:06:20.720> feel<00:06:20.930> very<00:06:20.960> into

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
the crowd just didn't feel very into

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.650 
the crowd just didn't feel very into
this<00:06:22.010> game<00:06:22.490> at<00:06:22.700> all<00:06:22.850> it's<00:06:23.270> a<00:06:23.420> college

this game at all it's a college
atmosphere<00:06:23.990> guys<00:06:24.500> if<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:25.040> crowd<00:06:25.310> should<00:06:25.670> be

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
atmosphere guys if the crowd should be
