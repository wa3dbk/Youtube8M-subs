opportunity sebald went ahead and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.440 
opportunity sebald went ahead and
created<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.620> model<00:02:19.800> world<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.910> seems<00:02:21.150> as<00:02:21.270> if

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
created a model world and it seems as if

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.350 
created a model world and it seems as if
they<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.960> succeeded<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.270> replacing<00:02:24.270> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
Egypt that felt we have had at number

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.590 
Egypt that felt we have had at number
long<00:03:20.220> time<00:03:20.430> ago<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:24.209> wouldn't<00:03:24.510> have

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
long time ago and we wouldn't have

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.870 
long time ago and we wouldn't have
developed<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.470> type<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.070> weapons<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:26.820> a

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
developed the type of weapons you have a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.060 
developed the type of weapons you have a
war<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.600> flight<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.680> all<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:28.920> stuff

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
war and flight and all this stuff

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.720 
war and flight and all this stuff
because<00:03:29.570> man<00:03:30.570> hadn't<00:03:31.140> come<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.590> live<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.280> as

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
because man hadn't come to live here as

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.880 
because man hadn't come to live here as
it<00:03:32.970> seems<00:03:33.330> many<00:03:33.660> forever<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> other

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it seems many forever and so the other

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.699 
it seems many forever and so the other
worlds<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:39.690> will<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> very<00:03:40.260> easy<00:03:40.530> as

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
worlds this we will have a very easy as

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.890 
worlds this we will have a very easy as
we<00:03:41.160> thought<00:03:41.190> primitive<00:03:42.120> life<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.780> know

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
we thought primitive life but you know

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.460 
we thought primitive life but you know
that's<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:43.590> wonderful<00:03:44.870> they<00:03:45.870> don't<00:03:46.050> have<00:03:46.230> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
that's so wonderful they don't have the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.460 
that's so wonderful they don't have the
hot<00:03:46.709> Sun<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.360> they<00:03:48.480> don't<00:03:48.690> need<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:49.019> suit<00:03:49.260> and

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
hot Sun so they don't need the suit and

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.030 
hot Sun so they don't need the suit and
tie<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.820> drop<00:03:50.820> winters<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.540> summers<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.950> all

tie and drop winters and summers and all

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.229 
tie and drop winters and summers and all
of<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> they<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.760> an<00:03:53.880> even

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
of that they just have an even

this water around the earth the Sun

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.560 
this water around the earth the Sun
would<00:04:01.470> he<00:04:01.950> dump<00:04:02.310> during<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.670> day<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.150> at

would he dump during the day and at

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.660 
would he dump during the day and at
night<00:04:03.630> at<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.380> Sun<00:04:04.560> went<00:04:04.769> wrong<00:04:05.010> keep<00:04:05.310> into

night at the Sun went wrong keep into

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.310 
night at the Sun went wrong keep into
the<00:04:05.790> water<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.330> when<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> water<00:04:06.870> keeps

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
giving off heat during the night so as

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.970 
giving off heat during the night so as
to<00:04:11.070> give<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.370> even<00:04:11.820> temperature<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:13.380> absorbs

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
to give it even temperature it absorbs

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.909 
to give it even temperature it absorbs
the<00:04:14.160> heat<00:04:14.540> during<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> day<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.109> he's<00:04:16.680> also

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the heat during the day and he's also

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.159 
the heat during the day and he's also
want<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.489> make<00:04:17.729> sure<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.390> was<00:04:18.780> more<00:04:18.989> like

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
want to make sure that it was more like

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.320 
want to make sure that it was more like
the<00:04:19.320> high<00:04:19.530> spring<00:04:20.810> blow<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:22.430> right<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the high spring blow for right that is a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.050 
the high spring blow for right that is a
su<00:04:24.630> default<00:04:25.020> again<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.650> then<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.760> spring

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
su default again and then the spring

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.740 
su default again and then the spring
comes<00:04:27.330> close

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
comes close

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.400 
comes close
summer<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.650> was<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> very<00:04:28.980> comparable

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
summer it was a very comparable

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.330 
summer it was a very comparable
temperature<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.470> they<00:04:34.470> don't<00:04:34.680> read<00:04:35.010> the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
temperature and so they don't read the

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.480 
temperature and so they don't read the
normal<00:04:35.760> police<00:04:36.030> station<00:04:36.630> is<00:04:36.870> no<00:04:37.050> hospital<00:04:37.770> so

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
normal police station is no hospital so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.070 
normal police station is no hospital so
there's<00:04:38.610> no<00:04:38.790> medical<00:04:39.090> technology<00:04:39.750> model

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
there's no medical technology model
