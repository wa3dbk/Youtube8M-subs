00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
character and bravery getting on the

character and bravery getting on the
bowl<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> pressure<00:00:58.800> was<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.100> us<00:00:59.250> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
but actually was that the third goal of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.649 
but actually was that the third goal of
the<00:01:11.369> game<00:01:11.430> wasn't<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> Redmond's<00:01:12.240> coming<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659

soon<00:01:12.810> enough<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.049> their<00:01:13.260> equaliser<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
soon enough for their equaliser that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.140 
soon enough for their equaliser that
that<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.280> probably<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.850> settled

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that was probably the one that settled

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.620 
that was probably the one that settled
it<00:01:15.240> yeah<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.650> those<00:01:17.580> fatal<00:01:18.150> teams<00:01:18.450> within

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
think absolute scored a vital team at

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780 
think absolute scored a vital team at
this<00:01:21.750> place<00:01:21.990> wait<00:01:22.500> before<00:01:22.619> halftime<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.340> then

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
this place wait before halftime and then

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.980 
this place wait before halftime and then
obviously<00:01:23.909> getting<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.479> first<00:01:24.659> goal<00:01:24.869> was

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
obviously getting that first goal was

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
obviously getting that first goal was
crucial<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.380> us<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> thing

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
crucial for us but I think the thing

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
crucial for us but I think the thing
that<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.670> important<00:01:27.090> once<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.360> were<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.509> 11<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that was important once we were in 11 it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.719 
that was important once we were in 11 it
was<00:01:28.470> important<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:28.950> got<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> lead

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
was important we got back in the lead

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
was important we got back in the lead
relatively<00:01:30.360> quickly<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
relatively quickly because I think the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.080 
relatively quickly because I think the
longer<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.590> team<00:01:31.920> goes<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> more<00:01:32.880> difficult

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
longer that team goes the more difficult

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
longer that team goes the more difficult
then<00:01:33.479> becomes<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.079> fun<00:01:34.259> start<00:01:34.530> getting

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
then becomes and the fun start getting

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
then becomes and the fun start getting
agitated<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.700> sometimes<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.270> done

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
agitated and that can sometimes be done

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 
agitated and that can sometimes be done
in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> players<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> thankfully<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.850> us

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
in the players and but thankfully for us

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
in the players and but thankfully for us
that<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.600> wasn't<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> case<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.380> managed<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that that wasn't the case and managed to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
that that wasn't the case and managed to
get<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> goal<00:01:41.280> relatively<00:01:41.790> quickly<00:01:41.970> did<00:01:42.689> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
get a goal relatively quickly did you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
get a goal relatively quickly did you
give<00:01:42.899> Nathan<00:01:43.320> Redmond<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.710> specific

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
give Nathan Redmond any specific

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.649 
give Nathan Redmond any specific
instructions<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.850> halftime<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.540> he

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
instructions at halftime because he

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
instructions at halftime because he
looked<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.530> different<00:01:47.070> player<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
looked at a different player in the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
looked at a different player in the
second<00:01:47.670> half<00:01:47.759> today<00:01:47.909> no<00:01:48.600> I'm<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.200> just

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
sorry I tell me calm down you know I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.920 
sorry I tell me calm down you know I
think<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.240> fans<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.540> starting<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.810> get

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
think the fans are starting to get

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.899 
think the fans are starting to get
agitated<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.610> expect

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
agitated to them because they expect

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.280 
agitated to them because they expect
this<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.210> seen<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.659> after<00:01:54.930> 10<00:01:55.110> minutes

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this to be seen on up after 10 minutes

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
this to be seen on up after 10 minutes
so<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.579> guess<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.939> which

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so and I think I guess that's which

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.130 
so and I think I guess that's which
that's<00:01:57.240> never<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.719> case<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
that's never going to be the case you

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.450 
that's never going to be the case you
know<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.439> too<00:01:58.530> hard<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.310> way

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
know it's going too hard for the way

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.770 
know it's going too hard for the way
they<00:01:59.610> set<00:01:59.820> up<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> try<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> stop<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> playing

stages I felt and as I see I was

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.610 
stages I felt and as I see I was
completely<00:02:56.940> confident<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.660> clothes<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.110> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
completely confident my clothes and I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.250 
completely confident my clothes and I
feel<00:02:58.799> expected<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.400> go<00:02:59.579> through<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.260> no

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
feel expected this to go through and no

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.330 
feel expected this to go through and no
that's<00:03:01.440> easy<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> say<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:02.099> that<00:03:02.250> we've

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
that's easy to say that know that we've

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.850 
that's easy to say that know that we've
done<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> but<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.780> think<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.590> don't<00:03:04.769> have

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
done it but I think if you don't have

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.800 
done it but I think if you don't have
that<00:03:04.890> sort<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.190> confidence<00:03:05.610> then<00:03:05.849> people<00:03:06.720> can

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
that sort of confidence then people can

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.479 
that sort of confidence then people can
sense<00:03:07.019> that<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.500> I'll<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.040> quote

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
sense that but I'll just quote

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.729 
sense that but I'll just quote
completely<00:03:09.090> confident<00:03:09.480> mood<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.140> I<00:03:10.200> have

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
completely confident mood so I have

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.380 
completely confident mood so I have
enough<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.549> was<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.819> making<00:03:12.090> sure<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.329> were
