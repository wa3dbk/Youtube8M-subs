00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
new hard drive like this or I'll get
multiple<00:00:34.590> hard<00:00:34.770> drives<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.090> gonna

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
multiple hard drives so what you gonna

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.430 
multiple hard drives so what you gonna
want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:47.570> what<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.719> gonna<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.200> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
works without your hard drive in it

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
works without your hard drive in it
means<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> problem<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> hard

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
means there is a problem if you hard

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.200 
means there is a problem if you hard
drive<00:01:06.140> see<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> e<00:01:08.070> 69<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:08.970> drive

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

drive see this is the e 69 for my drive
I'm<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.510> too<00:01:09.630> sure<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.560> probable<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I'm not too sure if it's probable that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.220 
I'm not too sure if it's probable that
but<00:01:11.520> we're<00:01:11.670> about<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.909> find<00:01:12.119> out

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.950 

now<00:01:30.700> let's<00:01:30.910> see<00:01:31.090> what<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.330> does

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.440 

says<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.620> system<00:01:41.220> updates<00:01:41.580> room<00:01:41.760> all<00:01:42.360> right

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
yeah small but so that means it is my

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.060 
yeah small but so that means it is my
hard<00:01:46.080> drive<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
hard drive in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460 
hard drive in

end of it if it doesn't work then I need
a<00:03:37.920> new<00:03:38.040> hard<00:03:38.280> drive<00:03:38.490> still

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.920

oh and another thing that caused this is
that<00:04:17.140> what<00:04:17.320> I've<00:04:17.500> been<00:04:17.709> usually<00:04:18.130> doing<00:04:18.329> I've

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
that what I've been usually doing I've

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.090 
that what I've been usually doing I've
been<00:04:19.630> taking<00:04:20.049> out<00:04:20.110> my<00:04:20.260> hard<00:04:20.500> drives<00:04:20.739> with<00:04:21.070> the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
been taking out my hard drives with the

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.310 
been taking out my hard drives with the
cons<00:04:21.549> are<00:04:21.760> still<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:22.510> if<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.930> do<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.290> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.610 
cons are still on so if you do that a
lot<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.560> should<00:04:23.800> just<00:04:24.160> stop<00:04:25.020> yeah<00:04:26.020> that's
