00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 I renew and not change 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.340
 and indeed the new peugeot 208 e is true 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.450
 a great commercial success starting 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 from 2012 one million sales and 83 thousand 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 cars sold in Italy therefore a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.699
 great success the car liked 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.520
 a lot therefore could not be distorted 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.859
 a winning project and therefore have been 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 it has obviously been modified in design 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.660
 the front lights have been modified 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 the wider grille the relative part 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.570
 to the fog lights 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 the sportiest, most dynamic car yes 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 this aspect is slightly accentuated 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.640
 so liked the clientele a lot 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 the most dynamic sporting aspect 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.530
 of the car and us taillights with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.270
 LED technology new colors to give 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.129
 even more dynamic the car as for 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 example the orange power the color of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.600
 launch an engine a metallic color 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.620
 with golden specks and then two large ones 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 new two new matt matt colors 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 at the same time also satin finish 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 in addition to the visual aspect they also have a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 tactile appearance is very cute very much 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.789
 beautiful that give dynamism and elegance to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.949
 second that it is eyes great white silver 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.920
 to the car a patent for what 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 then arrives on the large production at 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 cost little more than a paint 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.979
 metallic and then change obviously 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.290
 the part relating to new rims 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 alloy wheels and then of course the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 on-board technology 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.270
 and then of course the technology on board 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.659
 technology on board the new info 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.759
 tel 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.710
 of the big touchscreen from 7 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 inch is maintained was one of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 great keys to peugeot's success 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.189
 208 as well as the worst to the task 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.409
 or the steering wheel and compact that gives 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 driving pleasure and handling the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 car and the dashboard and that yes 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.100
 reads above the crown of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.619
 steering wheel 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 today the technology is renewed therefore not 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.460
 more only with the info tainment that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 there was already from 2012 but also with the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 mirror screen or the possibility of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.860
 connect your smartphone to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.990
 screen and then bring back some of those 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.610
 which is the information present on the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.619
 our smartphone directly on the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.180
 large touchscreen and then the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.340
 technology is obviously expressed too 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.110
 through the engines new petrol engines 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 and new diesel engines all in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.719
 specifications euro 6 three-cylinder engines 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.910
 1000 of 68 horses 1200 of 82 horses the 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.280
 more tech engine that also becomes turbo 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.530
 then 1200 three-cylinder 110 horses 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.630
 combined with a 5-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.300
 or the brand new automatic transmission e 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.550
 at6 and then as tradition for i 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.430
 diesel engines euro 6 of course four 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.430
 1600 cylinders of 75 100 and 120 horses 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.069
 of course sport has always been 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.110
 inside the DNA of the peugeot brand 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.450
 208 obviously collects the inheritance 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.910
 important of all two peugeot series 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.330
 and therefore obviously also of the 205 la 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.660
 205 gti 30 years later it is called 208 gti 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 208 hp engine 6 euro 4 cylinder 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.709
 turbo and then in this case is added 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.410
 an even sportier version yet 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.350
 the more radical the 208 gti by peugeot sport 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.420
 always 208 horses even if an engine 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.010
 deeply modified in the line 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.680
 landfill and therefore in the supply of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.750
 power a more wider lower car 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.730
 with 18-inch differential wheels 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 mechanical torsen and 6-speed gearbox 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.180
 close together for driving pleasure 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 even more powerful
