why that isn't that quite sure but we
need<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.470> understand<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.070> women<00:01:24.400> respond<00:01:24.880> to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
need to understand that women respond to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.790 
need to understand that women respond to
things<00:01:25.330> like<00:01:25.600> character<00:01:25.900> qualities<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800

virtues and kindness and understanding

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.780 
virtues and kindness and understanding
and<00:01:29.050> those<00:01:29.830> are<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.160> things<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.460> we<00:01:30.610> need<00:01:30.730> to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
and those are the things that we need to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.360 
and those are the things that we need to
develop<00:01:31.450> into<00:01:32.080> our<00:01:32.200> own<00:01:32.380> persona<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.160> if<00:01:33.280> we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
develop into our own persona and if we

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.000 
develop into our own persona and if we
don't<00:01:33.520> grasp<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.300> simple<00:01:34.360> thing<00:01:35.110> then<00:01:35.650> we

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
don't grasp that simple thing then we

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.580 
don't grasp that simple thing then we
think<00:01:36.330> women<00:01:37.330> ought<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.750> get<00:01:37.870> turned<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.380> to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
think women ought to get turned on to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.890 
think women ought to get turned on to
the<00:01:38.800> things<00:01:39.040> that<00:01:39.250> may<00:01:39.400> turn<00:01:39.460> us<00:01:39.910> on<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:40.390> it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
the things that may turn us on and it's

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.620

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
so that just came a huge illustration

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.410 
so that just came a huge illustration
and<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:01.980> they're<00:03:02.549> not<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.849> difficult<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and and they're not that difficult to

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.479 
and and they're not that difficult to
figure<00:03:03.659> out<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:04.170> stop<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.620> most<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.980> us<00:03:05.069> are

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
figure out if we stop and most of us are

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.949 
figure out if we stop and most of us are
wise<00:03:05.760> enough<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.090> say<00:03:06.359> you<00:03:06.420> know<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.599> kind<00:03:06.900> of

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959

wise enough to say you know I kind of
know<00:03:07.139> that<00:03:07.409> but<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.099> matter<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.370> making<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
know that but it's a matter of making a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.690 
know that but it's a matter of making a
slight<00:03:09.269> adjustment<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.950> when<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.489> make

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
slight adjustment and and when you make

slight adjustment and and when you make
that<00:03:11.939> slight<00:03:12.239> adjustment<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.870> has<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> huge

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that slight adjustment it has a huge

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.319 
that slight adjustment it has a huge
impact<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.819> some<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> great

simple<00:03:28.049> idea<00:03:28.290> here<00:03:28.919> think<00:03:29.579> through<00:03:29.909> what

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
simple idea here think through what
