red-hot towards the end of last season
and<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.720> expect<00:03:07.050> him<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.200> get<00:03:07.320> back<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.650> his

scoring<00:03:08.040> wise<00:03:08.190> very<00:03:08.610> soon<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.239> think<00:03:09.750> he<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:09.930> up

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
scoring wise very soon I think he put up

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.930 
scoring wise very soon I think he put up
such<00:03:10.230> great<00:03:10.500> numbers<00:03:10.620> last<00:03:10.920> year<00:03:11.100> 13<00:03:11.730> goals

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.260 
and 14 games it's just so much
expectation<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.190> him<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.430> think<00:03:14.459> right<00:03:15.000> now<00:03:15.209> he

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
expectation on him I think right now he

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.880
