hard<00:00:17.230> drive<00:00:17.439> that's<00:00:18.010> named<00:00:18.250> cheetah<00:00:18.580> because

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
hard drive that's named cheetah because

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.999 
hard drive that's named cheetah because
it<00:00:19.000> is<00:00:19.150> so<00:00:19.420> freakin<00:00:19.840> fast<00:00:20.050> since<00:00:20.740> I<00:00:20.830> recently

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
it is so freakin fast since I recently

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.510 
it is so freakin fast since I recently
purchased<00:00:21.340> a<00:00:21.610> cheetah<00:00:21.849> 300<00:00:22.660> gigabyte<00:00:23.520> 15,000

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
purchased a cheetah 300 gigabyte 15,000

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.909 
purchased a cheetah 300 gigabyte 15,000
rpm<00:00:25.060> Drive<00:00:25.390> that<00:00:25.750> that's<00:00:25.930> pretty<00:00:26.140> fast<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.710> I

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
rpm Drive that that's pretty fast and I

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.400 
rpm Drive that that's pretty fast and I
want<00:00:27.430> more<00:00:27.610> space<00:00:27.719> so<00:00:28.719> I<00:00:28.750> was<00:00:28.960> thinking<00:00:29.290> about

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
want more space so I was thinking about

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.370 
want more space so I was thinking about
buying<00:00:29.800> another<00:00:30.040> and<00:00:30.489> making<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:31.090> raid<00:00:31.329> a<00:00:31.599> raid

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
buying another and making a raid a raid

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.319 
buying another and making a raid a raid
0<00:00:32.590> configuration<00:00:33.010> would<00:00:33.940> that<00:00:34.120> just<00:00:34.300> be

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
0 configuration would that just be

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.150 
0 configuration would that just be
overkill<00:00:34.750> to<00:00:34.960> get<00:00:35.079> a<00:00:35.110> few<00:00:35.320> more<00:00:35.410> gigs<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:35.980> it's

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
overkill to get a few more gigs and it's

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.560 
overkill to get a few more gigs and it's

storage review site you might want to

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.139 
storage review site you might want to
look<00:01:03.130> at<00:01:03.280> if<00:01:03.460> you're<00:01:03.550> looking<00:01:03.790> at<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:03.970> cheetah

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
look at if you're looking at the cheetah

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.550 
look at if you're looking at the cheetah
and<00:01:04.329> it<00:01:04.449> talks<00:01:04.629> about<00:01:04.689> some<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.110> speeds<00:01:05.350> of

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
and it talks about some of the speeds of

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.889 
and it talks about some of the speeds of
it<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:06.130> basically<00:01:06.460> most<00:01:07.060> hard<00:01:07.390> drives<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.869> a

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
it but basically most hard drives on a

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.789 
it but basically most hard drives on a
desktop<00:01:08.320> computer<00:01:08.560> are<00:01:09.210> 7200<00:01:10.210> rpm<00:01:10.799> 7,200

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
desktop computer are 7200 rpm 7,200

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.700 
desktop computer are 7200 rpm 7,200
revolutions<00:01:12.670> per<00:01:12.729> minute<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.990> laptops<00:01:14.500> are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
revolutions per minute the laptops are

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.550 
revolutions per minute the laptops are
usually<00:01:15.009> 5400<00:01:15.880> or<00:01:16.020> 4200<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.260> know<00:01:17.350> if<00:01:17.440> you

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
usually 5400 or 4200 you know if you

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
usually 5400 or 4200 you know if you
haven't<00:01:17.799> dealt<00:01:18.010> with<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.159> for<00:01:18.220> when<00:01:18.400> you<00:01:18.490> buy

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
haven't dealt with this for when you buy

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.370 
haven't dealt with this for when you buy
a<00:01:18.610> computer<00:01:18.760> they<00:01:19.540> always<00:01:19.720> say<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:19.870> you<00:01:20.290> get

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
a computer they always say like you get

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.050 
a computer they always say like you get
120<00:01:20.920> gigabyte<00:01:21.190> hard<00:01:21.310> drive<00:01:21.400> they'll<00:01:21.790> tell<00:01:22.000> you

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
120 gigabyte hard drive they'll tell you

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.850 
120 gigabyte hard drive they'll tell you
the<00:01:22.150> speed<00:01:22.450> ask<00:01:22.750> about<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.320> speed<00:01:23.590> because

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the speed ask about the speed because

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.289 
the speed ask about the speed because
it's<00:01:24.040> very<00:01:24.250> important<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:24.820> performance

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
it's very important in the performance

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.660 
it's very important in the performance
of<00:01:25.420> your<00:01:25.450> computer<00:01:25.620> how<00:01:26.620> fast<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.159> drive<00:01:27.430> is

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
of your computer how fast that drive is

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.100 
of your computer how fast that drive is
there<00:01:27.850> on<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.030> laptop<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.420> can't<00:01:28.780> really<00:01:28.930> go

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
there on the laptop you can't really go

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.140 
there on the laptop you can't really go
beyond<00:01:29.409> 7200<00:01:30.280> it'll<00:01:30.460> kill<00:01:30.610> your<00:01:30.729> battery<00:01:31.090> and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
beyond 7200 it'll kill your battery and

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.700 
beyond 7200 it'll kill your battery and
they're<00:01:31.510> always<00:01:31.690> made<00:01:31.930> much<00:01:32.110> smaller<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:32.619> they

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
they're always made much smaller so they

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.890 
they're always made much smaller so they
can't<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.040> quite<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.430> fast<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.600> Cheetahs

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
can't go quite so fast but the Cheetahs

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
can't go quite so fast but the Cheetahs
are<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:35.020> think<00:01:35.140> they're<00:01:35.290> 2<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.560> 1/2<00:01:35.619> inch

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
are I think they're 2 and 1/2 inch

them a copy my personal feeling is you

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.670 
them a copy my personal feeling is you
probably<00:03:17.940> don't<00:03:18.180> need<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.750> cheetah<00:03:19.140> 300

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

other gigabytes of files that you've got

other gigabytes of files that you've got
if<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.810> need<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> few<00:03:25.200> extra<00:03:25.230> gigabytes<00:03:25.860> of

if you need a few extra gigabytes of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.620 
if you need a few extra gigabytes of
storage<00:03:26.069> maybe<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.790> should<00:03:26.940> archive<00:03:27.299> some<00:03:27.480> of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
storage maybe you should archive some of

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.759 
storage maybe you should archive some of
your<00:03:27.750> files<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.140> compress<00:03:28.470> them<00:03:28.650> with

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
your files you can compress them with

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.229 
your files you can compress them with
zipping<00:03:29.069> them<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.820> ways<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
zipping them that's one ways to do it

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.380 
zipping them that's one ways to do it
the<00:03:30.930> other<00:03:31.380> way<00:03:31.530> would<00:03:31.799> be<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:35.269> buy<00:03:36.269> an

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
the other way would be to buy an

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.120 
the other way would be to buy an
external<00:03:36.690> drive<00:03:36.959> or<00:03:37.200> an<00:03:37.290> extra<00:03:37.500> internal<00:03:38.010> one

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
external drive or an extra internal one

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.590 
external drive or an extra internal one
that's<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.400> lot<00:03:38.579> cheaper<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.269> don't<00:03:39.420> need<00:03:39.510> to

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
that's a lot cheaper you don't need to

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.759 
that's a lot cheaper you don't need to
go<00:03:39.690> with<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.959> fast<00:03:40.170> because<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.620> pay<00:03:40.739> a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
go with that fast because you will pay a

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.050 
go with that fast because you will pay a
couple<00:03:40.980> hundred<00:03:41.220> dollars<00:03:41.370> more<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.000> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
couple hundred dollars more for that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.009 
couple hundred dollars more for that
hard<00:03:42.299> drive<00:03:43.609> for<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.700> cheetah<00:03:45.329> than<00:03:45.870> you

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
hard drive for the cheetah than you

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.390 
hard drive for the cheetah than you
would<00:03:46.200> for<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.829> standard<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.280> know

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
would for just a standard you know

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.849 
would for just a standard you know
Seagate<00:03:47.790> 7200<00:03:48.510> rpm<00:03:48.840> right<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.560> take<00:03:49.739> an

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
Seagate 7200 rpm right you take an

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.130 
Seagate 7200 rpm right you take an
external<00:03:50.130> drive<00:03:50.370> archive<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.030> back<00:03:51.239> but<00:03:51.989> if

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
external drive archive it back but if

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.660 
external drive archive it back but if
you<00:03:52.170> really<00:03:52.380> do<00:03:52.560> want<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.980> speed<00:03:53.280> yeah

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
you really do want all that speed yeah

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.599 
you really do want all that speed yeah
you<00:03:54.420> could<00:03:54.630> is<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.079> overkill<00:03:55.590> yeah<00:03:56.190> I'd<00:03:56.370> say

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
you could is it overkill yeah I'd say

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.250 
you could is it overkill yeah I'd say
it's<00:03:56.760> probably<00:03:56.850> overkill<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.540> do<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.870> way

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's probably overkill to do it that way

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.840 
it's probably overkill to do it that way
I<00:03:58.290> don't<00:03:58.620> think<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.829> raids<00:03:59.010> gonna<00:03:59.670> give<00:03:59.790> you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
I don't think the raids gonna give you

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.039 
I don't think the raids gonna give you
that<00:04:00.030> much<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.359> speed<00:04:00.540> improvement<00:04:00.930> you've

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
that much of a speed improvement you've

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.110 
that much of a speed improvement you've
already<00:04:01.200> done<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.920> lot<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.340> what<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.670> can<00:04:02.910> do

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
already done a lot of what you can do

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.490 
already done a lot of what you can do
but<00:04:03.540> if<00:04:03.630> you're<00:04:03.690> serious<00:04:03.959> gamer<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.410> you've

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
but if you're serious gamer and you've

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.720 
but if you're serious gamer and you've
got<00:04:04.590> huge<00:04:04.769> megabytes<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> files<00:04:05.579> you're

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
got huge megabytes of files you're

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.789 
got huge megabytes of files you're
trying<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> read<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.299> write<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.930> know<00:04:07.500> that

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
trying to read and write to I know that

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.309 
trying to read and write to I know that
extra<00:04:08.340> frame<00:04:08.730> per<00:04:09.090> second<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.109> make<00:04:10.290> a

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
extra frame per second you make a

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.190 
extra frame per second you make a
difference<00:04:10.859> in<00:04:11.069> your<00:04:11.130> success<00:04:11.519> in<00:04:12.200> playing

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
difference in your success in playing

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.370 
difference in your success in playing
these<00:04:13.380> things<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:14.870> keep<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.079> mind<00:04:16.169> I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
these things so keep that in mind I

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.020 
these things so keep that in mind I
guess<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.560> would<00:04:17.190> say<00:04:17.310> probably<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:18.000> I

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
guess I would say probably you know I

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.460 
guess I would say probably you know I
would<00:04:18.269> just<00:04:18.390> put<00:04:18.539> probably<00:04:19.079> most<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.350> those

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
would just put probably most of those

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.960 
would just put probably most of those
files<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.829> are<00:04:19.979> on<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.160> drive<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.820> need

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
files that are on that drive you need

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.120 
files that are on that drive you need
extra<00:04:21.239> storage<00:04:21.299> not<00:04:21.989> all<00:04:22.139> those<00:04:22.320> needing<00:04:22.979> as

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
extra storage not all those needing as

fast<00:04:23.430> access<00:04:23.940> move<00:04:24.300> those<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> separate

fast access move those to a separate

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
Drive that's a little bit slower and
