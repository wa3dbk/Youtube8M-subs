are endless

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.770 
are endless
okay<00:02:20.510> but<00:02:21.319> if<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.040> remember<00:02:22.250> how<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.550> did<00:02:22.819> my

version of the snare it was what it was
I<00:02:27.049> add<00:02:27.319> reverb<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:30.880> okay

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
I add reverb on to it okay

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.440 
I add reverb on to it okay
and<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.140> put<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.799> used<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.700> gate<00:02:35.360> will<00:02:35.989> use<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.680> to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and I put I used a gate will use them to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:59.289 
and I put I used a gate will use them to
skate<00:02:38.450> today<00:02:56.829> yeah<00:02:57.829> that's<00:02:58.010> good<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.670> little

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
skate today yeah that's good a little

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:07.410 
skate today yeah that's good a little
bit<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.480> release<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.019> doesn't<00:03:00.319> sound<00:03:00.470> sorry

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.050 

then<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.650> add<00:03:09.769> some<00:03:09.799> distortion<00:03:10.609> I'm

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
then you can add some distortion I'm

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.960 
then you can add some distortion I'm
gonna<00:03:11.329> use<00:03:11.510> call<00:03:14.950> if<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.160> don't<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.609> call

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
gonna use call if you don't have call

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.050 
gonna use call if you don't have call
any<00:03:17.930> any<00:03:18.380> kind<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.100> distortion<00:03:19.459> or<00:03:19.880> anything

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
any any kind of distortion or anything

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.199 
any any kind of distortion or anything
you<00:03:20.569> can<00:03:20.750> use<00:03:21.010> cabinet<00:03:22.010> saturated<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.030> can

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
you can use cabinet saturated you can

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.309 
you can use cabinet saturated you can
use<00:03:23.829> you<00:03:24.829> can<00:03:24.980> use<00:03:25.010> anything<00:03:25.900> once<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.109> sort

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
use you can use anything once you sort

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.500 
use you can use anything once you sort
of<00:03:27.410> got<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.799> strong<00:03:28.280> sort<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.730> tail<00:03:28.970> kind<00:03:29.389> of

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
of got this strong sort of tail kind of

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.400 
of got this strong sort of tail kind of
reverb<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:33.170> options<00:03:33.440> are<00:03:33.530> endless

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
reverb then the options are endless

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.199 
reverb then the options are endless
because<00:03:36.410> when<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.430> start<00:03:37.639> shaping<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.000> sound

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
because when you start shaping the sound

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.150 
because when you start shaping the sound
that's<00:03:38.450> gonna<00:03:38.660> kind<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.650> sound<00:03:39.829> like<00:03:39.889> one

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
that's gonna kind of sound like one

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.720 
that's gonna kind of sound like one
really<00:03:40.400> long<00:03:40.639> hollow<00:03:41.510> jaws<00:03:41.750> for<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:43.220> taking

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
really long hollow jaws for for taking

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.039 
really long hollow jaws for for taking
days<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:46.639> load<00:03:46.790> up<00:03:46.970> when<00:03:47.120> I'm<00:03:47.269> doing<00:03:47.690> screen

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
days to to load up when I'm doing screen

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.809 
days to to load up when I'm doing screen
capture<00:03:48.530> then<00:03:48.680> it's<00:03:48.829> it<00:03:49.489> always<00:03:49.670> is<00:03:50.599> so<00:03:51.819> it's

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
capture then it's it always is so it's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:05.199 
capture then it's it always is so it's
so

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.720 

so<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:07.319> doesn't<00:04:07.650> sound<00:04:07.769> great<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.700> I

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
so that doesn't sound great but like I

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.880 
so that doesn't sound great but like I
said<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.060> gonna<00:04:09.209> spend<00:04:09.480> 15<00:04:10.379> minutes<00:04:10.409> on<00:04:10.830> it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
said I'm gonna spend 15 minutes on it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.789 
said I'm gonna spend 15 minutes on it
this<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.120> technique<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.659> big<00:04:12.989> reverb<00:04:13.500> and

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
this is the technique a big reverb and

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.460 
this is the technique a big reverb and
then<00:04:14.040> it's<00:04:14.250> all<00:04:14.370> about<00:04:14.610> Reese<00:04:14.909> on<00:04:15.120> playing

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
then it's all about Reese on playing

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.710 
then it's all about Reese on playing
shaping<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> sound<00:04:16.859> making<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.850> fit<00:04:18.180> how<00:04:18.660> you

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
shaping a sound making it fit how you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.180 
shaping a sound making it fit how you
want<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:21.320> you<00:04:22.320> don't<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:22.710> want<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.040> lot<00:04:23.070> of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
want it you don't really want a lot of

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.990 
want it you don't really want a lot of
the<00:04:23.970> wind<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.510> that's<00:04:24.750> important<00:04:26.000> unless

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
the wind on it that's important unless

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.029 
the wind on it that's important unless
it's<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.419> loaded<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.900> mix<00:04:28.110> like<00:04:28.770> if<00:04:28.889> it's

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
it's so loaded in the mix like if it's

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.100 
it's so loaded in the mix like if it's
play<00:04:29.280> by<00:04:29.490> itself<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.660> not<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> elements

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
play by itself and it's not the elements

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.600 
play by itself and it's not the elements

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.300 

think<00:04:45.600> I'm<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.110> original<00:04:46.440> one<00:04:46.650> from<00:04:47.190> America

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
think I'm the original one from America

think I'm the original one from America
Giada<00:04:48.080> he<00:04:49.080> had<00:04:49.169> some<00:04:49.320> kind<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.590> photon<00:04:50.190> that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
Giada he had some kind of photon that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.520 
Giada he had some kind of photon that
was<00:04:50.580> been<00:04:50.729> controlled<00:04:51.030> by<00:04:51.060> an<00:04:51.180> out<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.300> focus

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
was been controlled by an out of focus

you<00:04:52.530> can<00:04:52.710> hear<00:04:52.949> you<00:04:53.820> can<00:04:54.030> hear<00:04:54.060> like<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.449> falter

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
you can hear you can hear like a falter

you can hear you can hear like a falter
kind<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.169> working<00:04:55.410> on<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.620> but<00:04:56.539> I'd<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:57.930> wouldn't

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
kind of working on it but I'd I wouldn't

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.719 
kind of working on it but I'd I wouldn't
solve<00:04:58.530> all<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.740> out<00:04:58.919> just<00:04:59.190> to<00:04:59.280> try<00:04:59.460> create

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
solve all that out just to try create

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.940 
solve all that out just to try create
your<00:04:59.849> own<00:04:59.880> because<00:05:00.450> it's<00:05:01.349> much<00:05:01.470> better<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:01.860> you

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
your own because it's much better if you

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.500 
your own because it's much better if you
trade<00:05:02.160> your<00:05:02.310> own<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:02.580> make<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:02.789> fit<00:05:03.060> better<00:05:03.090> in

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
trade your own you make it fit better in

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.839 
trade your own you make it fit better in
the<00:05:03.630> mix<00:05:03.810> as<00:05:03.930> well<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.380> so<00:05:05.310> that's<00:05:05.430> pretty<00:05:05.760> much

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
the mix as well so so that's pretty much

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.110 
the mix as well so so that's pretty much
the<00:05:05.940> technique<00:05:07.160> like<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:08.310> say<00:05:08.490> these<00:05:08.789> kind<00:05:09.030> of

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
the technique like I say these kind of

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.000 
the technique like I say these kind of
things<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:09.419> take<00:05:09.630> hours<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.470> was<00:05:10.620> just<00:05:10.800> I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
things can take hours this was just I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.879 
things can take hours this was just I
mean<00:05:11.130> it<00:05:11.430> sounds<00:05:11.700> pretty<00:05:11.970> good<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.930> we've

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
mean it sounds pretty good and we've

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.129 
mean it sounds pretty good and we've
been<00:05:14.099> working<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.639> for<00:05:14.669> how<00:05:15.330> long<00:05:15.510> couple

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
been working on it for how long couple

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.250 
been working on it for how long couple
minutes<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.479> technique<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:18.990> use

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
minutes so this is a technique I use

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.610 
minutes so this is a technique I use
it's<00:05:19.620> not<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.830> only<00:05:20.039> technique<00:05:21.470> I'm<00:05:22.470> gonna

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
it's not the only technique I'm gonna

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.439 
it's not the only technique I'm gonna
put<00:05:22.889> this<00:05:23.010> one<00:05:23.070> up<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.820> one<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.000> used<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.419> my

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
put this one up and the one I used in my

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.689 
put this one up and the one I used in my
track<00:05:24.870> which<00:05:25.500> is<00:05:25.680> called<00:05:25.889> searching<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.580> can
