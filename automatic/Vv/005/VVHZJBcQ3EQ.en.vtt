unless<00:04:35.580> I'm<00:04:35.729> gonna<00:04:35.850> do<00:04:36.060> at<00:04:36.150> least<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.419> hundred

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
unless I'm gonna do at least a hundred

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.860 
unless I'm gonna do at least a hundred
rounds<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:38.210> okay<00:04:41.270> in<00:04:42.270> really<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.750> only

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
rounds to it okay in really the only

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.930 
rounds to it okay in really the only
difference<00:04:43.050> is<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:44.160> Winchester<00:04:44.820> is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
difference is this the Winchester is

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.100 
difference is this the Winchester is
just<00:04:45.210> like<00:04:45.600> real<00:04:46.260> smooth<00:04:47.010> but<00:04:47.729> not<00:04:48.110> really

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
just like real smooth but not really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.750 
just like real smooth but not really
that<00:04:49.229> much<00:04:49.440> I<00:04:49.620> mean<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:49.860> know<00:04:49.979> krumping<00:04:50.640> is

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760
