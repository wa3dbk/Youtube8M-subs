00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.670
 hello everybody sees me a return 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.769
 with a special video mac so that's 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.609
 mac products that I hosted 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 lately whether it's shopping or 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.920
 exchanges or gifts so here we go 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.930
 if you want to see what is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 I had lately like mac products 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 stay with me in the first place I'm going 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.340
 so introduce you the new version 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 the way with diagrams so you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.160
 so know the old one so she's a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 black background completely we saw you 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 not so what they had in it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 had to open maryse out so 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.180
 a new version like this so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.879
 with the the closure completely 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.510
 transparent and art could see so 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.580
 the headlights in the pallet she 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.310
 can be bought in two parts 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.950
 pallets to consists of two parts 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.200
 a part where you actually put your 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.180
 lighthouses and subsequently seven parts 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.759
 wanted to clip inside the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.439
 palette is there so you'll have 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.909
 here is the cover and that is street 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 is completely transparent which you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.720
 can see see to make to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.210
 interior 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.329
 the palette so they cost 30 a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.549
 thirty red knee there is more so 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.740
 you have to buy both parts 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.340
 did not stand apart and you do it 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.049
 yourself 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.049
 you stack them one inside the other 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.990
 great what can i say by 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.369
 compared to this novelty which is that 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.200
 the plaintiffs vote because that makes 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.220
 still a few months that she 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.370
 exit the transparent side on the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.670
 closing is really convenient 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.510
 so you can see the lighthouses and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.209
 personally it inspires me when I 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.739
 look at the palettes in front of me and 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.709
 necessarily the one that attracts me is the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.480
 colors that are visible and the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.230
 closing so I really like the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 closing it is more or less so 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.810
 it's not really magnetic but it's 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.080
 more or less magnetic 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.660
 so here's the little flat I can 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.959
 to say it is in relation to this principle 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.250
 to have two parts is charged so 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.620
 two components of the palette 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.900
 we could have just one I do not know 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.120
 for what reason they did not 2 ya 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 badly from collection that came out these 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.470
 recent times and frankly forcibly 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.150
 to have several collections one gets 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.790
 not tired but here I am 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.549
 personally -30 and I choose 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.730
 always a few items I do not I do not 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.930
 not jump on it so on all 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.910
 collections coming out of chez mac 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.860
 especially that they make almost all 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.240
 two months and so that's it 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.710
 concerning the 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.320
 yesterday not the last collection 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.040
 the penultimate so the magnetic news 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.680
 I think I took a gloss that my dear 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.820
 actually advised me to take this is the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.740
 hover price is these years when you 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.700
 go there the whole collection it was in 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:43.320
 nude tones 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.480
 so here I am putting you a switch here 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.120
 in the collection we so there was 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.710
 nude lipsticks and as I do not 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.100
 I'm not very very doubt about the 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.410
 lips 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.570
 so here I just fell for this 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.370
 gloss that I find they get married 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.440
 great with other colors with 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.900
 other lip pencils having played little 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.670
 and therefore worked a gloss with a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.530
 customer or a gloss with a red to 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.320
 lips it can give something 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.080
 very very very beautiful of the punk connection 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.700
 to the killer I will introduce you to the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.890
 sewing connection and outlets 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.350
 in the United States and on the French site 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.820
 a few months ago now 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.830
 unfortunately she did not go out 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.090
 belgium but I had as always and 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:27.550
 a customer angels from elsewhere who 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.340
 I was able to buy myself 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.680
 it 's something to lipstick so there is 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.660
 of lipstick that I spent at a 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.050
 friend she flaps so much and 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.450
 I kept some by which I kept the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.660

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.630

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.330

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.370
 lips and but this lipstick I them 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.030
 wore a lot of times by adding a 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.870
 a touch of gloss sometimes 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.970
 transparent sometimes a little apple green and 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.780
 it really gives a magnificent effect 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.700
 on lips if you like dark 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.990

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.660
