00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.580
 but to everyone I show you a 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.120
 timer a staircase timer 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.870
 this is very old is a 20 9 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.190
 90 250 volts and 10 amps 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.590
 in this ballet roulette regulates the time 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.340
 that we want it to be on and this 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.710
 it's electors 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.290
 this is with the push buttons you mean 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.290
 that will time the time with 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.540
 relationship to how we select it here in 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:09.399
 the roulette is vertical we would say that it is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.920
 fixed if we put it there is 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.990
 constantly on and there's no need to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.800
 to go doing the pulsation and this that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.800
 it's off 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.100
 well the operation 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.980
 regardless of what we're going to see 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.650
 and with the cables have a good 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.380
 power to what is the switch 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 this would be the turn of the lamp 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 power also of neutral and return 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.170
 pushbutton operation or 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.170
 first parts that make up is 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.400
 and a coil in which has a plunger 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.140
 once it has current this goes up 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.380
 up he stays there and he has 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.040
 a mercury switch already very 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.750
 old and apart nowadays are already 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.830
 prohibited in this system of 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.810
 switches also has a contact 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.260
 here another one here that is the one who does the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 timing and a metal plate that 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.220
 it expands 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.100
 if we raise what is the plunger with 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.190
 what is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.670
 the coil 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.750
 this to have ground current by the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.300
 downstairs 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.519
 disconnects and little by little it gets cold 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.280
 the metal plate 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.360
 right now the switch would be 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.030
 working this keeps on cooling down 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:51.239
 and disconnect in case we're going to see how 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.239
 it works and the scheme that is 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.060
 that usually comes with numbers is 1 2 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.069
 3 and 4 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.469
 we have that 2 is the neutral 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.290
 we feed him and apart from that he will go 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.969
 by all floors by all 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.590
 stairway landings or all sites 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.150
 that you want to feed this is the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.780
 neutral where you will also have a round 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.770
 pushbutton 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.319
 all this this connection that is here 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.920
 I would be inside a box I would go 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.209
 the push button has a turn 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.030
 and is the one that activates so that it works 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.870
 that is the whole system also has the 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.480
 phase enters by number 3 and once 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.489
 we give the button is activated in order to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.750
 the lamps during the time also 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.190
 scheduled and once the plate 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.910
 bimetallic cools down then disconnects 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.480
 there were also other possibilities 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.599
 formerly they had 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.150
 on the roofs a feeder 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.920
 television then or a plug that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.960
 they needed for a lamp above 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.930
 so 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.810
 and black a thread was also raised and 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.780
 said four - wire was because 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.390
 any villain in the part of the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.810
 roof or anywhere could 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.790
 take 220 and put or a light bulb 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.650
 with a switch for a room a 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.000
 plug the antenna feeder what 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.220
 I can very well, because this is the 9 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.700
 I'm going to do the installation, I hope 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.650
 like it and I said it I have it as a 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.200
 relic because all these things that 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.140
 They are very old because I have repaired 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.370
 I sometimes like to keep them and 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.370
 Besides, it still works
