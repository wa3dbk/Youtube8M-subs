00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.910
 hello everyone here I am back 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 with a video on lipstick from the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.650
 mark melanie you had asked me 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.330
 and this video linger a little bit 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.629
 just because I do them but 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.480
 before but I lost some of 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.730
 the recording unfortunately so I 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.739
 just come back to the beginning of the video for 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.480
 tell you my opinion about these reds to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.699
 lips and I will leave you later 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.410
 smashes as well as the momentum of 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.149
 colors and lipsticks 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.500
 so what can I say about 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.710
 these lipsticks first of all who 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.579
 are super pigmented he would have text 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.309
 pretty creamy textures and are they 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.590
 dry the palate at the student but the 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.020
 little flat that I have and with its reds 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.619
 lipstick is that if you do not put 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.320
 a contour lip outline you have 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.600
 so the colors they have 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.570
 tend to cut their teeth small of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.369
 little folds that you have so the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.610
 fine lines that you have around the lips 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.960
 I do not know because 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.390
 girls maybe you will not have 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.000
 not this concern but for people 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.700
 of a certain age that also starts to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.530
 see this kind of been reduced to the middle 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.600
 around the eyes and around the lips 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.640
 so we try to pay attention to that 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.350
 and we try to find the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.450
 best products kg capoue who 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.700
 hide that kind of problem and I knew 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.070
 little worries so if I do not put 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 with only those with its reds to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.250
 lips 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.630
 melanie and because they have they have a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.060
 creamy texture 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.789

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.149
 glossy the majority of these roja delivery 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.549
 to a glossy enough finish and they have 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.799
 tendency to spin in the airs 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.990
 were very hard so I had to share 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.899

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.270
