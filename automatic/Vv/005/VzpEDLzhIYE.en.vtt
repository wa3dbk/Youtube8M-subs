00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.120
 was leaving 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.110
 decided to leave them on 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.240
 security island 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.580
 sleep here well because the only 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.810
 the best option was to move away from 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:38.070
 hitting the collision was to leave here already 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.320
 I was practically the face of us not 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.660
 got neither on the counter on an island 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.460
 security and at the meeting 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.310
 that's where the glass rolls this place beats 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.820
 I understand, yes, this is already with me 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.150
 rejected on the counter from the blow because 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.280
 that punch was a good battery and they 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.480
 hit the right front door 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.280
 i.e 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.830
 no not forward they had to make sure 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.260
 but if they are the police then they should not 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.239
 violate the rules of the road and not 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.650
 create an accident rate and immediately a group 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.569
 will already understand how someone 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.209
 we have broken now just by the facts 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.850
 operate on what happened based on that 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.340
 what could i do to create 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.800
 I ask the crash to the right, I would have gathered there 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.740
 several cars here I made a decision 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.150
 go here on the island of security 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.539
 already deleted when I coped with them 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.830
 prologue that is already started 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.699
 unfold so when I left 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.860
 car under the police turns 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.060
 unfolded in the area of ​​the island but not 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.740
 The islands have a couple of words about 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.680
 directly how the accident occurred where 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.110
 you went to the oncoming traffic lane avoiding 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.990
 collisions even when i made the decision 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 get away from the collision because again 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.940
 same genre I did not understand what they want 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.250
 make they included no turns no 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.750
 included well I do not understand what the guys wanted 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.860
 make here a machine which patrol on 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.340
 which rode before you sharply 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:12.500
 stopped abruptly start the camp that is 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.660
 I'm already just leaving here, I already understood 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.150
 what I practically security in this 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.660
 the moment they took me hit right and 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.479
 the car is turned back to 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.639
 your patrol back there to Crimea 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.919
 they are what truths get me 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:34.720
 brake happened yes tell with whom 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.720
 you were driving and if injured in an accident 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.870
 the ambulance was watched thank God cost 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:45.440
 Yes patrol guys were together at 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.139
 typewriters are not affected by the word that 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.410
 said patrol on the accident that 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:53.300
 Does your version match 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.010
 By all indications that there is no because they 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.340
 immediately began to become follow or 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.180
 which we confirm them wrong 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.180
 meaning what exactly 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.330
 I personally understood what they were saying 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.280
 designers supergroup have any 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.090
 nothing is said yet only 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.510
 drove up 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.860
 and started making out we are already standing here 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.650
 a half hour or two 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.510

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:25.220
