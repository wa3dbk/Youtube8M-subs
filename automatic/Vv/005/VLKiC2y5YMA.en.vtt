metal has been marked and we're ready to
cut<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:06.000> our<00:02:06.630> case<00:02:06.930> where<00:02:07.140> we'll<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.500> using<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
cut in our case where we'll be using a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.980 
cut in our case where we'll be using a
dremel<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.490> look<00:02:08.700> at<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.060> okay<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
dremel to look at this okay now that the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.540 
dremel to look at this okay now that the
aluminum<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.500> cut<00:02:10.740> what<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.100> want<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.430> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
aluminum is cut what you want to do is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.220 
aluminum is cut what you want to do is
you<00:02:11.670> want<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.910> test<00:02:12.090> fit<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> put

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you want to test fit it you want to put

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.310 
you want to test fit it you want to put
it<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.500> top<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.950> petal<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.790> ensure<00:02:15.210> that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
it on top of the petal to ensure that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.340 
it on top of the petal to ensure that
the<00:02:16.320> actual<00:02:16.740> cuts<00:02:17.040> fit<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.120> petal<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.080> next

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the actual cuts fit the petal the next

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.320 
the actual cuts fit the petal the next
step<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> very<00:02:19.680> important<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.060> want<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
step is very important what you want to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.090 
step is very important what you want to
do<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.630> as<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.990> can<00:02:22.140> see<00:02:22.320> some<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.770> edges

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
do is as you can see some of the edges

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.220 
do is as you can see some of the edges
are<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> little<00:02:23.459> bit<00:02:23.670> rough<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.110> make

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
are a little bit rough you want to make

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.500 
are a little bit rough you want to make
sure<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.530> grind<00:02:25.890> those<00:02:26.190> edges<00:02:26.730> down<00:02:26.940> as<00:02:27.209> best
