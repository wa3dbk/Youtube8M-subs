harmonica<00:00:04.890> today<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:05.819> using<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:06.270> c-major

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
harmonica today we're using a c-major

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.020 
harmonica today we're using a c-major
diatonic<00:00:07.470> harmonica<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.519> we're<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> be

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
diatonic harmonica and we're going to be

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:20.970 
diatonic harmonica and we're going to be
talking<00:00:09.240> about<00:00:09.389> vibrato

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:30.510 

so<00:00:21.970> this<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.510> threat<00:00:22.870> for<00:00:22.900> Bronte<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:30.310> is<00:00:30.490> a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
so this is a threat for Bronte this is a

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.849 
so this is a threat for Bronte this is a
Jo<00:00:30.820> vibrato<00:00:31.210> which<00:00:31.660> I'm<00:00:31.870> not<00:00:32.050> very<00:00:32.169> good<00:00:32.230> at

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:46.200 

and<00:00:38.859> then<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.699> hand<00:00:39.909> karate<00:00:44.249> so<00:00:45.249> let's<00:00:45.909> start

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
and then the hand karate so let's start

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.279 
and then the hand karate so let's start
with<00:00:46.329> a<00:00:46.359> throat<00:00:46.659> vibrato

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
with a throat vibrato

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.569 
with a throat vibrato
because<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.649> think<00:00:47.710> this<00:00:48.039> is<00:00:48.250> one<00:00:48.429> that's

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
because I think this is one that's

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.250 
because I think this is one that's
easiest<00:00:49.149> for<00:00:49.420> me<00:00:49.859> although<00:00:50.859> I<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:52.600> it's

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
easiest for me although I think it's

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.849 
easiest for me although I think it's
some<00:00:53.619> people<00:00:53.799> can<00:00:54.070> find<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.339> quite<00:00:54.460> hard<00:00:55.859> so

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
some people can find it quite hard so

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.859 
some people can find it quite hard so
how<00:00:57.010> do<00:00:57.070> you<00:00:57.189> do<00:00:57.369> well<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:58.059> three<00:00:58.449> brother

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
how do you do well the the three brother

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.599 
how do you do well the the three brother
is<00:00:59.140> all<00:00:59.289> about<00:01:00.570> changing<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.689> air<00:01:02.609> airflow

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
is all about changing the air airflow

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.830 
is all about changing the air airflow
very<00:01:04.299> very<00:01:04.570> slightly<00:01:05.070> into<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.100> harmonica<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
very very slightly into the harmonica so

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
very very slightly into the harmonica so
you<00:01:07.929> want<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.289> do<00:01:08.439> that<00:01:08.619> by<00:01:09.929> constricting<00:01:10.929> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you want to do that by constricting and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.889 
you want to do that by constricting and
opening<00:01:13.299> your<00:01:13.330> throat<00:01:13.899> very<00:01:14.740> very<00:01:15.009> quickly

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
opening your throat very very quickly

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.050 
opening your throat very very quickly
you<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:17.080> get<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.289> similar<00:01:17.619> effect<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.880> to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
you can get a similar effect just to

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.419 
you can get a similar effect just to
understand<00:01:19.600> what<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:20.709> all<00:01:20.950> about

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
understand what it's what it's all about

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.690 
understand what it's what it's all about
if<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:22.060> blow<00:01:22.869> into<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.259> harmonica<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:24.069> hit

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
if you blow into the harmonica and hit

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.469 
if you blow into the harmonica and hit
your<00:01:24.940> diaphragm<00:01:26.399> just<00:01:27.399> underneath<00:01:28.240> your

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
your diaphragm just underneath your

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.800 
your diaphragm just underneath your
breast<00:01:28.929> plate<00:01:29.229> so<00:01:29.530> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.569> straight

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
breast plate so this is just a straight

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.240 
breast plate so this is just a straight
note<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.409> then<00:01:32.590> I'm<00:01:32.709> going<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:32.890> hit<00:01:33.069> my

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
note and then I'm going to hit my

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.710 
note and then I'm going to hit my
diaphragm

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.630 

they<00:01:41.720> say<00:01:41.930> there's<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.200> difference<00:01:42.710> when<00:01:43.610> you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
they say there's a difference when you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.690 
they say there's a difference when you
increase<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.530> amount<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:46.220> air<00:01:46.399> flowing

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
increase that amount of air flowing

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.810 
increase that amount of air flowing
through<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.180> food<00:01:47.750> harmonica<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.490> how<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:49.729> you

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
through the food harmonica so how do you

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.880 
through the food harmonica so how do you
do<00:01:49.939> one<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.479> best<00:01:50.689> ways<00:01:50.899> I've<00:01:51.110> found<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.680> to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
do one of the best ways I've found is to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.600 
do one of the best ways I've found is to
lie<00:01:52.159> down<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:53.149> play<00:01:53.479> your<00:01:53.630> harmonica<00:01:54.610> lying

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
lie down and play your harmonica lying

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.609 
lie down and play your harmonica lying
down<00:01:55.850> with<00:01:56.090> their<00:01:56.240> head<00:01:56.420> facing<00:01:57.080> straight<00:01:57.380> up

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
down with their head facing straight up

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.870 
down with their head facing straight up
and<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:59.450> practice<00:02:00.009> trying<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:01.220> create<00:02:01.460> this

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and just practice trying to create this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
and just practice trying to create this
sound

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.130 

and<00:02:07.940> Alethea

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.580 

and<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.790> alter<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.819> speed<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.590> as

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and you can alter the speed of that as

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.470 
and you can alter the speed of that as
much<00:02:18.860> as<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.850> what<00:02:19.970> about<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.270> two

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
much as you like so what about the two

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.440 
much as you like so what about the two
of<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.720> Bharata<00:02:21.640> again<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> said<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.240> not

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
of a Bharata again like I said I'm not

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.530 
of a Bharata again like I said I'm not
very<00:02:23.959> good<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.760> don't<00:02:26.180> really

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
very good at this and I don't really

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.170 
very good at this and I don't really
know<00:02:26.750> anyone<00:02:27.050> who<00:02:27.319> is<00:02:27.550> amazingly<00:02:28.550> good<00:02:28.640> at<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
know anyone who is amazingly good at it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.080 
know anyone who is amazingly good at it
I<00:02:29.240> don't<00:02:29.510> don't<00:02:29.840> think<00:02:29.959> it's<00:02:30.080> an<00:02:30.200> amazing

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
I don't don't think it's an amazing

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.070 
I don't don't think it's an amazing
technique<00:02:32.090> when<00:02:32.360> you've<00:02:32.480> got<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> throat

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
technique when you've got the throat

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.380 
technique when you've got the throat
karate<00:02:33.470> now<00:02:33.770> but<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:35.360> basically<00:02:35.900> involves

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
karate now but it basically involves

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.910 
karate now but it basically involves
dropping<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:40.010> tightening<00:02:40.820> your<00:02:40.970> jaw

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
dropping and tightening your jaw

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.160 
dropping and tightening your jaw
repeatedly<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.750> there's<00:02:44.750> obviously<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
repeatedly so there's obviously a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
repeatedly so there's obviously a
difference<00:02:45.590> in<00:02:45.739> sound<00:02:45.980> between

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.740 

that's<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.540> mr.<00:02:55.720> Banerjee<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> trick

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
that's all mr. Banerjee and so the trick

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.949 
that's all mr. Banerjee and so the trick
is<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.709> to<00:03:00.010> work<00:03:00.580> your<00:03:00.819> jaw<00:03:01.090> enough<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.930> that

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
is to is to work your jaw enough so that

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.520 
is to is to work your jaw enough so that
you<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.379> get<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.830> time<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:04.530> quickly

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
you can get it in time and quickly

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.290 
you can get it in time and quickly
enough<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.800> make<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.250> sound<00:03:06.459> good

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
enough to make you sound good
