00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.900
 of this channel this time we have 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 camera review of the tsja or mini 4 and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.139
 this interface usually changes with 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.449
 updates so you could see it 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 different on your device and we're going to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 start by analyzing your interface as you see 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.130
 here we have a hdr selector that we 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.160
 allows us to have hdr live after we 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 allows to have a normal or off hdr 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 I recommend that you have it live 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.010
 because it looks a lot better 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 photography we take it and as you see the shot 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 very fast that I've always liked 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 these xiao cameras take me the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 pictures very fast later we have 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.390
 here the camera selector for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
 exchange between the front and the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 back we go down and we have the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.930
 flash selector if we want it to be 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 as a normal flash we want it to be 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.379
 always on or we want it to be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.539
 automatic 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.520
 let's put it off because that's the way it is 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.530
 as I like button to start the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.420
 video recording the button to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 change of mode for example you change 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.399
 to the photo mode you switch to mode 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 but you can not record and take 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.960
 photographs at the same time then 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's go to photography and if we want to see 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 the list of effects we make a site like this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.170
 and they see in real time all the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.450
 filters as you see we have enough for 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.640
 mirror example that is a pretty effect 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 heavier than here you can see it or 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.799
 we have we go again to do this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 effect this gesture forgiveness and we have another 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.420
 effect for example mosaic and here you can 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.179
 place this so it looks pretty good 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.789
 quite original if you want a 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:42.929
 different photo there an effect is achieved 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.340
 very peculiar you get to have this then 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.080
 your list of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 effects very original effects 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.539
 japanese 70s in the end we have several 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 filters we are also going to return to normal 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.470
 what we have here and then if we do 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.720
 light to the other side we have the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.140
 modes for example refocus we are going to 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.640
 select refocus and I'll put my 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.030
 hand so that the approach we're going to put it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.429
 took the photograph wait a few seconds 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 not to move the device much and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.380
 then I can see it we're going to 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.750
 preview the already in the gallery 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.000
 there we have it as you see says magic focus 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.340
 so now I can select another 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.750
 area that wants to focus and as you see now 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.390
 focuses on the back 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.800
 there he focuses my hand and there he focuses the part 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.890
 back so you can do this 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.810
 approach that is well enough 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.900
 ok but I do not know how useful it is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.330
 now the other way that is h dt that is 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.920
 night mode I do not know why he will have that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.840
 name but it 's obviously night mode 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.340
 when you have very little light is a way 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.080
 that will serve you but you should not move 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 much the cell phone later we have the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.610
 timer something that I also like and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.250
 we have a ten time selector 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.709
 seconds five seconds three seconds or 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.709
 nothing we are going to put for example five 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.000
 seconds and as you see it emits a sound 321 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.530
 and ready to take the picture is 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.350
 good enough to take some pictures 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.970
 with the rear camera so I like it 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.530
 also have a timer after 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.020
 we have skin tones that simply goes 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.940
 to blur or it will light up a bit 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.180
 different the skin you can have high 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.800
 medium low and high medium low or off 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.209
 then also if you want me to 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.830
 Blur your skin a little bit 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.110
 select there we have the mode 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.630
 panoramic let's take some pictures 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.970
 panoramic as you see we are moving forward 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.750
 moving forward and stop when 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.400
 we want 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.980
 says saving it takes a while for 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.630
 process and let's see the result is 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.930
 pretty good although it does not come out with good 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.280
 resolution as you see it comes out very blurred 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.470
 then the panorama does not come with the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.360
 resolution that we would like and finally 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.920
 we go to manual mode we have here the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.810
 manual mode that allows us as you see 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.940
 also the most broken interface and that does not 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 like we have here the selector 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.720
 white balance incandescent light 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.970
 day I always say these balance sheets of 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.860
 whites are to set the color if 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 is that the screen is not seeing 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.840
 in automatic mode as seen in 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.040
 the reality in this case if you see 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.500
 we also have the focus as you see 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.360
 you can do a manual approach to 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.239
 focus on nearby objects manually 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.890
 or far away then you can create some 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.110
 very nice effects with this approach 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.030
 manual we're also going to put it in 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.329
 automatic we have manual exposure 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.680
 also to see the speed of 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.750
 shutter that the cell phone has 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.520
 obviously if you put 2 seconds 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.860
 the sensor is going to have 2 seconds of 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.570
 time to capture light and therefore it goes 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.490
 to leave a very illuminated photograph in 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 this case came out white if you know of 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.670
 photography you know take advantage of this mode if 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.710
 do not 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.810
 with automatic mode 3 was enough 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.840
 we also have the selector made that 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.790
 as you see we have iso 100 up to 3200 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.370
 then we have a pretty good range 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.470
 to take some original photos we're going to 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.720
 put for example a photo so it goes to 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.300
 leave a little moved by the kind of 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.220
 parameters that I put then we have 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.080
 all this these possibilities in this 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.970
 camera and finally we have the button 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.620
 configuration to allow saving 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.180
 location if you want to disable the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.640
 camera sounds if you want that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.650
 save the date you have and the date 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.260
 written in the photograph if you want a 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.300
 reference lines guide this is very 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.950
 interesting that scans qr codes in 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.930
 real time is something that all 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.330
 cameras should now integrate what 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.340
 you want me to do if you leave the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.500
 capture button and it's for you to shoot 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.210
 in burst how do you want your 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.640
 Facial detection quality as you see 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.080
 you also have many options you can 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.360
 even change the contrast of your 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.820
 photographs the saturation the sharpness 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.670
 to have some more pictures to your 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.530
 then let's go back to the mode 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.810
 normal to return to normal mode you should 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.490
 deactivate the manual and now we are going to 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.090
 leave the button pressed for what 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.300
 how to take the burst 10 12 17 how many goes 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.770
 30 can continue to take it looks like the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.050
 iphone then since we take all the 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.750
 We can see them here, but the 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.090
 we see separate it seems to be since it took 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.539
 all the blast here we have it and as 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.880
 you see tells us one of 59 2 of 59 and so 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.830
 we could go seeing all of us not the 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.449
 group and that I do not like much and good 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.490
 as you see that is all we are going to change to 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.440
 the front camera and the front camera 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.539
 we only have the account mode 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.419
 regressive and a curious detail 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.460
 it simply shows us an age 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.680
 approximate that here calculates an age 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.630
 very large and then if you're a man or 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.520
 woman then that's all that 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.130
 we have and here if you want me to 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.810
 diffuse in a high medium low or 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.800
 totally turned off 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.900
 then those are all 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.180
 configurations that we find in it already 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.860
 me four me and in his camera I hope that 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.780
 you liked this video and see you 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.090
 the next one after we find the 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.280
 headset for calls a camera 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.400
 front of 5 megapixels and there is 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.539
 hidden a small led 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.700
 notifications after we will find 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:52.810
 the 5 inch screen converter 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.810
 full hd 1080 by 1920 pixels
