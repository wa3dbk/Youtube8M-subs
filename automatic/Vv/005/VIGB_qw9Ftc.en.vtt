00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
to change away from large stereo systems

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.269 
to change away from large stereo systems
with<00:00:28.859> lots<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.640> piles<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.779> components<00:00:31.410> as

a<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.739> could<00:00:34.920> create<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a way that we could create a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.920 
a way that we could create a
high-performance<00:00:35.880> audio<00:00:36.149> system<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> was

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
high-performance audio system that was

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720 
high-performance audio system that was
essentially<00:00:37.500> disguised<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> beautiful

essentially disguised as a beautiful
pair<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> loudspeakers<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.649> did<00:00:40.890> was

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
pair of loudspeakers so what we did was

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.410 
pair of loudspeakers so what we did was
we<00:00:41.910> took<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:43.010> loudspeaker<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.059> six<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we took a loudspeaker and a six and a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.260 
we took a loudspeaker and a six and a
half<00:00:45.480> inch<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.989> size<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.670> built<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.239> of

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
performance audio system so that was

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
performance audio system so that was
really<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> basic<00:02:06.060> concept<00:02:06.569> in<00:02:06.780> terms<00:02:06.959> of

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
really the basic concept in terms of

techniques that you would use in Jenner

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
techniques that you would use in Jenner
and<00:02:32.280> creating<00:02:32.640> high-performance<00:02:33.269> cars<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and creating high-performance cars and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.479 
and creating high-performance cars and
aircraft<00:02:34.079> it's<00:02:34.349> not<00:02:34.530> about<00:02:34.769> weight<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.280> heft

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
aircraft it's not about weight and heft

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.000 
aircraft it's not about weight and heft
to<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.299> create<00:02:36.629> something<00:02:37.140> that's<00:02:37.410> very<00:02:37.530> solid

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to to create something that's very solid

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
to to create something that's very solid
it's<00:02:38.129> about<00:02:38.430> using<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.420> very<00:02:39.690> stiff<00:02:40.049> very

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
it's about using very very stiff very

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.900 
it's about using very very stiff very
very<00:02:40.440> strong<00:02:40.739> materials<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.489> knowing<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.849> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
very strong materials and knowing how to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.390 
very strong materials and knowing how to
brace<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.450> scientifically<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.859> a<00:02:43.890> great

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
brace them scientifically so a great

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.210 
brace them scientifically so a great
deal<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.609> thought<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:44.910> attention<00:02:45.150> went<00:02:45.720> into

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
deal of thought and attention went into

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.039 
deal of thought and attention went into
to<00:02:47.220> getting<00:02:47.790> all<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> residences<00:02:48.690> out<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
to getting all the residences out of the

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.569 
to getting all the residences out of the
cabinet<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.769> speakers<00:02:50.130> sound<00:02:50.280> very

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
cabinet so the speakers sound very

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.670 
cabinet so the speakers sound very
natural<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.150> lifelike<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.959> really<00:02:52.530> were

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
natural and lifelike and really were

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.319 
natural and lifelike and really were
they<00:02:52.859> where<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.370> think<00:02:53.609> particularly<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
they where we think particularly that

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.020 
they where we think particularly that
they<00:02:54.480> shine<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.650> area<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> imaging<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
they shine is in the area of imaging the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.050 
they shine is in the area of imaging the
imaging<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:57.660> speakers<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:59.060> absolutely

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
imaging on these speakers is absolutely

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.909 
imaging on these speakers is absolutely
razor<00:03:00.359> sharp<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.530> those<00:03:01.650> things

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
razor sharp and it's one of those things

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.759 
razor sharp and it's one of those things
where<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.310> create<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.959> beautiful

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
where we can create that that beautiful

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.159 
where we can create that that beautiful
pallet<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.819> three-dimensional<00:03:06.569> space<00:03:06.599> of

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
pallet in three-dimensional space of

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.659 
pallet in three-dimensional space of
where<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> artists<00:03:08.069> sound<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.519> they're

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
where the artists sound like they're

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.129 
where the artists sound like they're
coming<00:03:08.940> from<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.359> where<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.569> music<00:03:09.870> sounds

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
coming from and where the music sounds

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.990 
coming from and where the music sounds
like<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.440> coming<00:03:10.709> from<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:11.700> really

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
like it's coming from and that's really

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.210 
like it's coming from and that's really
probably<00:03:12.720> what<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:13.019> consider<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.919> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
probably what we consider to be the the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.539 
probably what we consider to be the the
highest<00:03:14.870> order<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.260> performance<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.280> all<00:03:17.400> out

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
highest order of performance of all out

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.589 
highest order of performance of all out
speakers<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.540> our<00:03:18.989> imaging<00:03:20.180> capable<00:03:21.180> sounding

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599
