 using a barrier such as a wall of the

 the friend let to increase vehicle 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.980
 few until I can ask for it up close 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.489
 some dogs are more motivated by 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.440
 toys then found that more 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.250
 motivates even the dog and uses 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.250
 improve this leap 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.680
 now we are going to use this people that he 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.870
 already knows as a basis for the next 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.580

 let it jump closer to your waist 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.299
 possible 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.739
 Ufa 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:43.200
 the cast 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.159
 gradually picking up the leg 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.159
 stretched 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.379
 also 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.050
 it's little 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.930
 also jumps 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:29.630
 also joked the chicken 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.010
 this same transformation will be done 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.940
 to teach others to practice this 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.710
 new 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.880
 one of the times they have to stay with the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.889
 back to top 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.889
 If he hits, then reward. 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.460
 gradually turning his back on him 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.460
 He even managed to stay totally on his back. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:30.430
 counts the set a goal 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:55.910
 drive crazy
