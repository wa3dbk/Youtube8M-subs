this<00:00:00.719> episode<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.199> experimented<00:00:01.920> with<00:00:01.979> 3d

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
this episode I experimented with 3d

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.910 
this episode I experimented with 3d
printers<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:03.449> make<00:00:03.600> molds<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.380> concrete

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
printers to make molds for a concrete

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.250 
printers to make molds for a concrete
product<00:00:05.400> line<00:00:08.480> my<00:00:09.480> friends<00:00:09.870> over<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
product line my friends over at the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.140 
product line my friends over at the
urban<00:00:10.559> animal<00:00:11.010> scientist<00:00:11.490> asked<00:00:11.849> me<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
urban animal scientist asked me if I

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.799 
urban animal scientist asked me if I
could<00:00:12.210> design<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.960> better<00:00:13.320> dish<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.099> dog<00:00:14.340> food

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
could design a better dish for dog food

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.390 
could design a better dish for dog food
so<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> turned<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> handsomest<00:00:16.890> dog<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.369> know

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
so I turned to the handsomest dog I know

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.929 
so I turned to the handsomest dog I know
Fletcher<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> watched<00:00:19.320> him<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> meal<00:00:20.130> his

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Fletcher and watched him have a meal his

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.420 
Fletcher and watched him have a meal his
typical<00:00:21.330> dog<00:00:21.750> dish<00:00:22.080> has<00:00:22.410> straight<00:00:22.980> edges

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
typical dog dish has straight edges

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
typical dog dish has straight edges
which<00:00:23.699> makes<00:00:24.000> getting<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> food<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
which makes getting all the food a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
which makes getting all the food a
little<00:00:25.350> bit<00:00:25.590> difficult<00:00:25.859> without<00:00:26.430> moving

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
little bit difficult without moving

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.900 
little bit difficult without moving
around<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.330> bowl<00:00:27.800> bowls<00:00:28.800> with<00:00:29.130> sloped<00:00:29.490> edges

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
around the bowl bowls with sloped edges

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
around the bowl bowls with sloped edges
often<00:00:30.570> tip<00:00:30.750> over

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
often tip over

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.889 
often tip over
resulting<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.769> messes<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.480> wanted<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
resulting in messes so I wanted to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
resulting in messes so I wanted to
design<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> dish<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.829> easy<00:00:35.040> access<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
design a dish with easy access to the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.479 
design a dish with easy access to the
food<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.420> wouldn't<00:00:37.050> tip<00:00:37.230> over<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> made<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
food that wouldn't tip over so I made a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.080 
food that wouldn't tip over so I made a
3d<00:00:38.910> model<00:00:39.300> using<00:00:39.540> 1/2<00:00:40.170> 3d<00:00:40.680> i<00:00:40.920> sculpted<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> with

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
3d model using 1/2 3d i sculpted it with

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.110 
3d model using 1/2 3d i sculpted it with
meshmixer<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.280> printed<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> prototype<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
meshmixer and printed the prototype with

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.080 
meshmixer and printed the prototype with
my<00:00:45.329> MakerBot<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:48.980> sanded<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.039> prototype<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
my MakerBot I sanded the prototype with

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.380 
my MakerBot I sanded the prototype with
some<00:00:51.300> fine<00:00:51.539> grade<00:00:51.840> sandpaper<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:54.120> make<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
some fine grade sandpaper to make the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
some fine grade sandpaper to make the
silicone<00:00:54.809> mold<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.289> glued<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.770> piece<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
silicone mold I glued a piece of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.200 
silicone mold I glued a piece of
Tupperware<00:00:56.430> down<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> laminate<00:00:58.320> board<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
Tupperware down to a laminate board I

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.340 
Tupperware down to a laminate board I
cut<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> bottom<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> Tupperware<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
cut out the bottom of the Tupperware and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
cut out the bottom of the Tupperware and
glued<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.860> prototype<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> few<00:01:05.939> dots

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
glued in the prototype with a few dots

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.070 
glued in the prototype with a few dots
of<00:01:06.420> hot<00:01:06.450> glue<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.790> then<00:01:08.790> mix<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.479> parts<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of hot glue I then mix the two parts of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.010 
of hot glue I then mix the two parts of
mold<00:01:10.320> star<00:01:10.619> 30<00:01:10.979> together<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.810> poured<00:01:12.810> them

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
mold star 30 together and poured them

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.440 
mold star 30 together and poured them
into<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.439> mold

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
once the silicon is cured you can remove

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.640 
once the silicon is cured you can remove
the<00:01:21.700> Tupperware<00:01:22.000> mold<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:25.260> pull<00:01:26.260> out<00:01:26.440> the
