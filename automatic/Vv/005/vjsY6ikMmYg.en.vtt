00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.260
 young people here is the market too 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.940
 another commentary in the background 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.580
 I leave a team deathmatch game 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.029
 Run fast with the scorpion 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.750
 magazine silencer was involved 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.429
 geissen raiders still in the water and on 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.180
 the conclusion I think the holiday games I 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.400
 lightning a heli and the loud 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.360
 notar users reached for the first time 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.420
 someone gets and yes otherwise I have 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.490
 you prepared the theme of lag switching 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.780
 He has appointed each of them is a thing 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.910
 I'll just come to my mustard 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.650
 Add that just does not not concern 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.660
 what this subtract 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.280
 First of all, that's it at all 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.190
 a small box 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.000
 you can between the router and the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.560
 xbox stuck and which in the game 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.089
 causes that when you look at one 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.719
 opponent tells that I just do not 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.829
 Moved is made by the company 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:13.869
 what I want it to be and how the 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.229
 life works is in black ops 2 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.600
 visited the so-called host system that 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.009
 works just so that just one of 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.869
 The team becomes random 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.429
 Selected rust still knows well 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.659
 the west line and besides, all will 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.499
 sent signals 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.420
 if these signals then i say it on 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.939
 best 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.909
 For example, I shoot with the house 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.009
 sent almost give signal back 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.290
 I will become the abstract of his will 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.430
 he sent you back and you got 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:51.060
 it always goes with everyone with everyone 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.619
 next day so and this thing i 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.049
 just does that if you are if you are 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.920
 I aim for an opponent then comes 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 not directly that the opponent still 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.429
 can react or or else but 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 it comes dead directly dead 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.930
 so I shoot enemies dead because of me 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.299
 compost dies because opponents of this is 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.380
 the causes I have just gets the little 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.420
 that's why it's only possible 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.010
 mostly if at call of duty 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.930
 not at battlefield or otherwise 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.860
 because these games are all over 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.760
 run servers that are not tasted 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.170
 because on these servers could this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.090
 modern times just have to even 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.320
 turn off myself that I put myself 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.549
 which does not hold anything so that's it 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.140
 actually so far and what can you still 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.820
 do against this thing you can 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.440
 Actually, we can do these people 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.560
 to report there 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.590
 I heard one of those from the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 this gameplay so popular 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.150
 has become 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.500
 the thing has already said much the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 Incidentally, I will link pages there 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.190
 I point my finger down 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.010
 not for seville because of that it is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.720
 stay you can maybe report that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.579
 I do not know if that brings much 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.560
 maybe if there are enough people 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.579
 to report this 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.319
 but otherwise I do not feel like it 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.680
 that tractor then because I'm doing here 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.989
 can 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.560
 I just do not know about their servers 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.850
 but always runs this wittenhorst 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.079
 Well 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.810
 where can you get this team from 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.269
 already said by a company from the us 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.540
 You have to pay 50 dollars 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.280
 Send and his credit card number 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.410
 which will probably prevent that 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.970
 here are some little kids one 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.019
 pretty much at the beginning of this shit 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.489
 but I have heard of the max fps 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.260
 and I have myself for a 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.760
 guided visit and successful 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.049
 found that one is so one 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.489
 can easily build a part 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.940
 If the time I look I think 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.319
 so far inferior but that was it 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.790
 My opinion on the things I hold 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.140
 deposit a little more music 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.970
 behind the gameplay because I find it 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.010
 actually is a brand new coming 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.810
 7.30 3 comes out after my first one 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.360
 first takes a bit wrong though 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.360
 I wish you a nice day 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.990
 74 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.240
 This bosch in the US scene 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.200
 No 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.199
 bodyguards 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.180
 here so yes 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.180
 si 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.710
 in st
