00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
tutorials back but I'm just using my 217

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
tutorials back but I'm just using my 217
to<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.649> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> crease<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.490> bit

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to put it in the crease a little bit

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
to put it in the crease a little bit
this<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.149> adds<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.780> more<00:01:22.020> depth

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
this just adds a little bit more depth

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.900 
this just adds a little bit more depth
now<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.130> taking<00:01:23.490> night<00:01:23.729> star<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.420> NARS<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
now I'm taking night star from NARS and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.620 
now I'm taking night star from NARS and
putting<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> inner<00:01:27.840> part<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.830> my<00:01:28.950> eye

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
putting it in the inner part of my eye

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
putting it in the inner part of my eye
and<00:01:30.630> blending<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.679> up<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.580> as<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and blending it up a little bit as you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.820 
and blending it up a little bit as you
can<00:01:33.179> see<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.929> adds<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.289> little<00:01:34.470> bit<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
can see this just adds a little bit of a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.460 
can see this just adds a little bit of a
highlighted<00:01:35.550> color<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.869> look<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.350> it's

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
highlighted color to the look so it's

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.639 
highlighted color to the look so it's
not<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.190> boring<00:01:38.880> tan<00:01:39.479> pigment<00:01:40.080> I'm
