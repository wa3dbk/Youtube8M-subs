00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.830
 water it is one of our most precious 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.849
 natural resources 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 but our water supply is limited 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.330
 97.5% of the water on earth is salt and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.369
 only 2.5% is sweet but more than 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 two thirds of this fresh water is in the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.500
 pool caps and glaciers 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
 so only 0.5% is in our lakes 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 rivers and groundwater and we can 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.580
 use for agriculture industry and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.350
 own use 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.440
 but due to pollution the quality of 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.780
 this water very bad 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.750
 according to the world health organization 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.640
 is only 0.007 percent of all it 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.910
 water in the world safe for 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.440
 consumption and this miniscule amount 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.130
 must pass through more than 7 billion people 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.309
 the water is not shared either 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.200
 equally distributed around the world at 1.2 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.580
 billion people live in areas with 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.920
 water scarcity 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.119
 like the southwest of the usa india 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.100
 spain north africa australia and it 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.720
 north of china 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.180
 at the same time the demand for water is increasing 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.619
 just add it 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.660
 the last hundred years is the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.800
 world population is now simple and 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.800
 the use of water has increased sixfold 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.509
 but our total water supply is the same 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.910
 Many more people have continued to use it 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.910
 of the same limited amount of water 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.790
 what is the cause of this enormous 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.790
 growth in water consumption 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.569
 An important reason is the growing 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.610
 middle class in emerging markets like 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.229
 disposable income is rising 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.729
 people change their eating habits and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.009
 she will eat more meat 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.860
 thirteen hundred liters of water are needed 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.369
 for the production of one kilo of wheat 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.550
 34 100 liters for 1 kilo of rice but there 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.150
 15,500 liters of water is needed for the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.160
 production of one kilo of beef 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.990
 and if the population remains prosperous 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.260
 the meat consumption is growing 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.090
 expected to double in 2050 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.040
 with this pace the total demand is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 water in 2030 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.570
 40 percent higher than the amount that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.860
 is available in the world 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.170
 but what can we do with this water 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 do a problem 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.650
 develop innovative companies 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.270
 solutions to the water scarcity 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 to improve quality 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.120
 and more efficient use of this precious 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.220
 natural resource 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.380
 that's how 70 percent of the total goes 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.240
 water consumption to agriculture 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.130
 what the ground water supply in some 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.320
 regions depleted 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.459
 by for technologies such as 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.530
 farmers can choose drip irrigation 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.780
 the water consumption for their crops with 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.780
 70 to 80 percent 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.340
 also urbanization and industrialization 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.810
 put the supply of fresh water under pressure 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.760
 the industry is responsible for 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.230
 around 20% of the global 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.910
 water consumption 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.430
 for everything from producing 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.860
 clothing and electronic gadgets to it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.239
 generating electricity is very much 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.709
 need water 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.720
 in addition, it becomes industrial 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.680
 wastewater discharged into our waters 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.580
 which pollutes our water 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.950
 technologies for recycling 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.320
 industrial water such as advanced 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.390
 filtration systems and closed recycling 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.640
 Systems can help to put pressure on 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.180
 to reduce our water resources and the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.549
 refine 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.079
 at the same time, the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.540
 urbanization in developing countries 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.430
 increasing entire water supply 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.109
 networks 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.250
 sewerage systems and 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.840
 water treatment plants 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.599
 this stimulates the demand for pipes 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.159
 engineers and construction plans in the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.930
 developed countries is outdated 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.560
 infrastructure in the meantime 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.129
 replacement 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.810
 up to 30% leaks in the cities 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.340
 it is clear that the old pipes 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.139
 must be replaced 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.269
 but measurement systems and advanced 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.370
 Sensors can also be used by utility companies 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.689
 useful for tracking down and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.489
 to fix it 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.799
 without ruining entire parts of the city 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.510
 There are even more ways to get the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.519
 amount of fresh water available 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.129
 raise some countries in coastal areas 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.349
 with water scarcity such as saudi arabia 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.169
 the united arab emirates and 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.879
 Spain are moving to desalination to the 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.590
 meet growing demand 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.389
 For example, Singapore has plans to change the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.840
 desalination scupper chic expand 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.609
 to go with that in 2006 30% of the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.949
 meet total water needs 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.810
 companies that have degreasing technologies 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.199
 delivering can help make this possible 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.380
 to make 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.970
 robecosam invested in this and many others 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.250
 companies that offer solutions for 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.990
 the global water problem 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.729
 investing in these types of solutions 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.930
 further than just people by the water 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.699
 help out 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.770
 it's also about taking advantage of it 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.080
 long-term growth opportunities and it 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 increase the portfolio return 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.340
 we water industry is expected 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.990
 grow from $ 500 billion now to 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.990
 one million in 2020 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.419
 robecosam sustainable water capital 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.949
 gather to use ours sustainably 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.949
 water supply possible
