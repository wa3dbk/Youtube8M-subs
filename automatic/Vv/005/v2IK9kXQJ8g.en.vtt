nice rebound okay and we couple that up
with<00:00:37.110> what<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> full<00:00:38.129> wood<00:00:38.340> core<00:00:38.540> some<00:00:39.540> titanium

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
with what a full wood core some titanium

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
with what a full wood core some titanium
as<00:00:40.500> well<00:00:40.680> yeah<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> wood<00:00:41.969> core<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.300> there

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
as well yeah we put a wood core in there

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.290 
as well yeah we put a wood core in there
so<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.780> nice<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:42.960> damp<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:45.059> layers

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so it's nice and damp we do two layers

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950 
so it's nice and damp we do two layers
of<00:00:45.739> of<00:00:46.739> titanium<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.510> way<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.750> we

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
of of titanium which is the way that we

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
of of titanium which is the way that we
build<00:00:49.230> our<00:00:49.410> titanium<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.610> ski

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
build our titanium and put it in the ski

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.869 
build our titanium and put it in the ski
it<00:00:51.210> creates<00:00:51.690> awesome<00:00:52.760> torsional<00:00:53.760> rigidity

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it creates awesome torsional rigidity

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.569 
it creates awesome torsional rigidity
without<00:00:54.750> compromising<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> flex<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.250> ski

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
without compromising the flex of the ski

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.840 
without compromising the flex of the ski
okay<00:00:57.059> um<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.500> wood<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> ski<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
okay um when you put wood into a ski and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.170 
okay um when you put wood into a ski and
metal<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.989> tends<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> dampen<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
metal it tends to dampen it so in the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899 
metal it tends to dampen it so in the
bamboo<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.379> bamboo<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.920> okay<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
bamboo we put bamboo it okay and the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
bamboo we put bamboo it okay and the
bamboo<00:01:06.270> helps<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> ski-doo<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:07.799> yeah<00:01:08.280> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
bamboo helps the ski-doo what yeah but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
bamboo helps the ski-doo what yeah but
not<00:01:08.670> only<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> renewable<00:01:09.600> source<00:01:09.750> which

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
not only is it a renewable source which

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.399 
not only is it a renewable source which
is<00:01:10.380> great<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.850> also<00:01:12.030> creates<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:13.020> pop

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
is great but it also creates more pop

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.950 
is great but it also creates more pop
and<00:01:13.740> snap<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.400> makes<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> much<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.360> lively

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and snap it makes it a much more lively

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.840 
and snap it makes it a much more lively
energetic<00:01:16.619> ski<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:19.290> other

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
energetic ski so that we can use other

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.240 
energetic ski so that we can use other
materials<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.180> dampen<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> without

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
materials to dampen it without

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.960 
materials to dampen it without
compromising<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> type<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> performance

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
compromising that type of performance

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.420 
compromising that type of performance
that<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.990> gear<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.259> looking<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.860> okay<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that this gear is looking for okay and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.609 
that this gear is looking for okay and
some<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.450> unique<00:01:27.720> features<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.500> have

some other unique features are we have

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
some other unique features are we have
an<00:01:28.710> anti<00:01:29.009> vibration<00:01:29.220> system<00:01:29.790> yep<00:01:30.509> which<00:01:30.750> does

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
an anti vibration system yep which does

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.719 
an anti vibration system yep which does
exactly<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> says<00:01:31.740> anti-vibration

exactly what it says anti-vibration

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
exactly what it says anti-vibration
underfoot<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> smooth<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.350> give<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
underfoot to smooth it out give it a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
underfoot to smooth it out give it a
nice<00:01:35.100> silky<00:01:35.520> smooth<00:01:35.790> ride<00:01:36.060> okay<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> then

we've also got all-terrain rocker

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
we've also got all-terrain rocker
because<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> little

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
because this is going to be a little

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.899 
because this is going to be a little
more<00:01:40.470> adventurous<00:01:40.710> ski<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.340> probably<00:01:41.670> yeah
