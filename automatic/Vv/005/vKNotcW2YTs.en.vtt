00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.949 
this map it's kind of like the ACR cept
a<00:02:12.110> little<00:02:12.410> more<00:02:12.530> recoil<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.190> stuff<00:02:13.959> there's

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a little more recoil and stuff there's

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.720 
a little more recoil and stuff there's
that<00:02:15.110> sniper<00:02:15.380> again<00:02:15.650> his<00:02:15.890> heels<00:02:16.430> up<00:02:16.520> there<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
that sniper again his heels up there the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.300 
that sniper again his heels up there the
whole<00:02:16.819> game<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.209> keeps<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.510> back<00:02:17.630> there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
whole game just keeps going back there

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.559 
whole game just keeps going back there
again<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:19.850> it's<00:02:20.000> accurate<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
again for because it's accurate it

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.760 
again for because it's accurate it
doesn't<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.020> do<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.260> good<00:02:21.470> damage

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
doesn't have to do that good damage

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.140 
doesn't have to do that good damage
which<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.069> why<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> stopping<00:02:22.580> power<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:23.030> it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
which is why you stopping power on it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.370 
which is why you stopping power on it
that<00:02:25.150> because<00:02:26.150> it's<00:02:26.300> pretty<00:02:26.780> accurate<00:02:26.930> and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
that because it's pretty accurate and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.900 
that because it's pretty accurate and
you<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:27.770> use<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.890> along<00:02:28.130> ranges<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.610> stuff<00:02:30.910> my

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
you can use it along ranges and stuff my

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.990 
you can use it along ranges and stuff my
killstreaks<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.600> 579<00:02:33.819> which<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.670> guys<00:02:37.819> have

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
killstreaks are 579 which you guys have

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.030 
killstreaks are 579 which you guys have
told<00:02:38.090> me<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.269> switch<00:02:38.330> up<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> will<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.680> just

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
told me to switch up so I will it's just

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.259 
told me to switch up so I will it's just
all<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> games<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.640> have<00:02:40.819> been<00:02:40.910> uploading

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
all the games that have been uploading

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.059 
all the games that have been uploading
now<00:02:41.420> I'll<00:02:41.680> pre-recorded<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.920> was

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
now I'll pre-recorded and that was

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.759 
now I'll pre-recorded and that was
pretty<00:02:43.489> much<00:02:43.610> most<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:44.000> them<00:02:44.120> i<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.269> using<00:02:44.769> the

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
pretty much most of them i was using the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.610 
pretty much most of them i was using the
scale<00:02:45.980> streak<00:02:47.110> pulmonary<00:02:48.110> i<00:02:48.260> killed<00:02:48.500> else

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
scale streak pulmonary i killed else

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.259 
scale streak pulmonary i killed else
calling<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.010> my<00:02:49.190> pretty<00:02:49.700> much<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.910> was<00:02:50.030> kind<00:02:50.239> of

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
calling in my pretty much it was kind of

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:58.150 
calling in my pretty much it was kind of
sucked<00:02:50.510> ah<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:57.319> yeah<00:02:57.500> probably<00:02:57.769> by<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.010> map

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
sucked ah so yeah probably by the map

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.289 
sucked ah so yeah probably by the map
pack<00:02:58.340> once<00:02:58.519> school<00:02:58.790> gets<00:02:58.940> out<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:02.180> i'll

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
pack once school gets out and then i'll

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.970 
pack once school gets out and then i'll
upload<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.570> few<00:03:02.720> game<00:03:02.870> plays<00:03:03.049> on<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.320> what<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
upload a few game plays on it what you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.860 
upload a few game plays on it what you
probably<00:03:04.100> still<00:03:04.459> what<00:03:04.850> still<00:03:04.940> impaled<00:03:05.269> by<00:03:05.390> ps3

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
probably still what still impaled by ps3

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.210 
probably still what still impaled by ps3
for<00:03:06.019> then<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> still<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.739> considered<00:03:07.190> new

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
for then so to still be considered new

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.400 
for then so to still be considered new
and<00:03:10.390> pretty<00:03:11.390> much<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.720> looking<00:03:11.959> forward<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
and pretty much is looking forward to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.190 
and pretty much is looking forward to
black<00:03:12.560> ops<00:03:12.890> i<00:03:13.190> really<00:03:13.519> hope<00:03:13.549> they<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:15.880> do<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
black ops i really hope they can do just

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.690 
black ops i really hope they can do just
fix<00:03:18.650> all<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.859> problems<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.250> modern<00:03:19.579> warfare

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
fix all the problems that modern warfare

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
fix all the problems that modern warfare
2<00:03:19.940> has<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:21.100> bring<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.160> really<00:03:22.370> good<00:03:22.489> game<00:03:22.720> is

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
2 has and bring a really good game is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.210 
2 has and bring a really good game is
that<00:03:23.900> probably<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.290> keep<00:03:24.380> letting<00:03:24.890> modern

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
that probably just keep letting modern

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.890 
that probably just keep letting modern
warfare<00:03:25.370> 2<00:03:25.609> into<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.940> comes<00:03:26.120> out<00:03:26.299> just<00:03:26.690> like

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
warfare 2 into that comes out just like

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.920 
warfare 2 into that comes out just like
november<00:03:27.350> nine<00:03:27.560> i<00:03:27.829> believe<00:03:28.900> there's<00:03:29.900> like

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
november nine i believe there's like

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.560 
november nine i believe there's like
five<00:03:30.200> months<00:03:30.380> away<00:03:30.680> all<00:03:31.040> right<00:03:31.239> don't<00:03:32.239> put<00:03:32.450> me

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
five months away all right don't put me

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:41.440 
five months away all right don't put me
on<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.810> but<00:03:33.019> around<00:03:33.500> there<00:03:38.470> so<00:03:39.730> fell<00:03:40.730> out<00:03:40.940> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
on that but around there so fell out it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.430 
on that but around there so fell out it
seems<00:03:41.630> like<00:03:41.810> you<00:03:41.900> have<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.109> stay<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
seems like you have to stay on the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.970 
seems like you have to stay on the
outside<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.720> most<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.930> gunfights<00:03:45.620> you'll

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
outside and most of the gunfights you'll

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.590 
outside and most of the gunfights you'll
get<00:03:46.130> into<00:03:46.310> our<00:03:46.549> long<00:03:46.760> range<00:03:46.940> which<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.390> why<00:03:47.540> the

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
get into our long range which is why the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.440 
get into our long range which is why the
m4<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.410> good<00:03:48.560> gun<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:50.120> can<00:03:50.150> just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
m4 is a good gun for it you can just

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.690 
m4 is a good gun for it you can just
pick<00:03:50.690> people<00:03:50.720> off<00:03:51.019> long-range<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:52.609> why

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
pick people off long-range so so why

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.390 
pick people off long-range so so why
snipers<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> good<00:03:53.269> for<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.920> can<00:03:55.100> see<00:03:55.220> here

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
like a very bad score to go away would

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.890 
like a very bad score to go away would
just<00:05:03.560> put<00:05:04.130> Jack<00:05:04.280> insertion<00:05:04.669> and<00:05:04.850> then<00:05:05.600> to<00:05:05.720> stay

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
just put Jack insertion and then to stay

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.600 
just put Jack insertion and then to stay
in<00:05:05.960> one<00:05:06.080> spot<00:05:06.230> of<00:05:06.560> map<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.919> whole<00:05:07.070> entire<00:05:07.340> game

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
in one spot of map the whole entire game

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.100 
in one spot of map the whole entire game
that's<00:05:08.919> really<00:05:09.919> annoying<00:05:10.070> I<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:14.690> see<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.840> think

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
and I'm trying to figure out where they

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.180 
and I'm trying to figure out where they
spawn<00:05:28.810> we<00:05:29.810> don't<00:05:29.930> nobody<00:05:30.229> uses<00:05:30.500> UAB<00:05:30.830> anymore

spawn we don't nobody uses UAB anymore

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.950 
spawn we don't nobody uses UAB anymore
which<00:05:31.370> I<00:05:31.520> really<00:05:31.640> hope<00:05:31.850> be<00:05:32.570> cool<00:05:32.750> if<00:05:32.810> they

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
which I really hope be cool if they

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.659 
which I really hope be cool if they
brought<00:05:33.350> back<00:05:33.530> three<00:05:33.710> five<00:05:33.919> seven<00:05:34.130> and<00:05:34.310> black

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
brought back three five seven and black

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.820 
brought back three five seven and black
ops<00:05:34.850> which<00:05:35.060> I<00:05:35.150> know<00:05:35.210> they're<00:05:35.390> not<00:05:35.419> going<00:05:35.570> to<00:05:35.630> do

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
ops which I know they're not going to do

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.310 
ops which I know they're not going to do
or<00:05:36.970> they<00:05:37.970> could<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.210> make<00:05:38.870> three

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
or they could just make three

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.580 
or they could just make three
automatically<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.160> first<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:42.290> UAV

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
automatically the first the UAV

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.840 
automatically the first the UAV
automatically<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.430> then<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.580> can<00:05:43.700> choose

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
automatically and then you can choose

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.890 
automatically and then you can choose
the<00:05:43.880> second<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.330> think<00:05:44.570> that'd<00:05:44.750> be<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.870> good

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
the second to think that'd be a good

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.540 
the second to think that'd be a good
idea<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.380> didn't<00:05:46.250> know<00:05:46.280> where<00:05:46.460> they<00:05:46.520> were

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
idea I didn't know where they were

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.950 
idea I didn't know where they were
spawning<00:05:46.910> so<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.180> just<00:05:47.330> dropped<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.630> Harrier

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
spawning so I just dropped the Harrier

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.030 
spawning so I just dropped the Harrier
back<00:05:48.169> on<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.380> pool<00:05:48.560> because<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.860> knew<00:05:49.010> that

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
back on the pool because I knew that

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.680 
back on the pool because I knew that
sniper<00:05:49.370> would<00:05:49.550> be<00:05:49.669> there<00:05:49.820> again<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:52.660> one<00:05:53.660> of

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
sniper would be there again and one of

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.270 
sniper would be there again and one of
the<00:05:53.810> reasons<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:54.200> think<00:05:54.229> people<00:05:54.470> camp<00:05:54.800> a<00:05:54.890> lot<00:05:55.010> is

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
the reasons I think people camp a lot is

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.460 
the reasons I think people camp a lot is
because<00:05:55.520> in<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.510> game<00:05:56.600> is<00:05:56.900> because<00:05:57.200> there's

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
because in this game is because there's

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.890 
because in this game is because there's
not<00:05:57.650> always<00:05:57.970> UAVs<00:05:58.970> up<00:05:59.180> like<00:05:59.390> if<00:05:59.570> you<00:05:59.600> aren't<00:05:59.840> a

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
not always UAVs up like if you aren't a

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.110 
not always UAVs up like if you aren't a
good<00:06:00.050> team<00:06:00.229> in<00:06:00.470> cod4<00:06:00.850> they're<00:06:01.850> pretty<00:06:02.060> much

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
good team in cod4 they're pretty much

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.860 
good team in cod4 they're pretty much
always<00:06:02.510> be<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:02.990> UAV<00:06:03.320> because<00:06:04.720> if<00:06:05.720> you're

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
always be a UAV because if you're

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.210 
always be a UAV because if you're
planning<00:06:06.080> a<00:06:06.140> good<00:06:06.260> team<00:06:06.410> everyone<00:06:06.890> keep

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
planning a good team everyone keep

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.620
