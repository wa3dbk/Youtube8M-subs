00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.880
 speak personal beauty guilherme and in the area 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 with one more game point and come here you are 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.030
 guarding the cold because of the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.650
 experience of faith 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 Surely the game will sell to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 damn right just that many people do not're 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
 enjoying the changes made in mechanics 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.270
 about the game 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 most of the criticism is due to the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 move system that now counts 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 with super-slipping jumps and even 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.840
 leave in the air 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 this agility all came to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 game taiwan fire and a player was 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 through twitter complain about this 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.559
 similarity to one responsible for the new 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 code and his response was when the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.989
 people to play in November will see that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 The game is very different and how are you? 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.579
 your expectations for the advance of the faith 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.579
 and another first person shooter game 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.739
 which has recently come out is the dest nÃ© and the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.640
 expectations for him were also in the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.980
 heights 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 although he is selling well he does not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.500
 has been as positive as this. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 neither the media nor the players so much that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 responsible studio may lose two 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 million and a half dollars because of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 an agreement that had been made with 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.380
 activision if the game reaches the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.630
 at least 90 no critical goal 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.090
 after a month of release they 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 They earn this bonus only currently 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 average is at 77 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.340
 It will be kind of hard to get in the 90s 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.579
 huh 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.079
 and look this game has succeeded in radios 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.509

 20 million players

 This is a game of cards that 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.400
 takes advantage of the mythology created by 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590

 talking about success recently was 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.439
 released in Japan the super smash bros and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.680

 no less than 1 million units

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.960

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.270
 second place was not even born 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.150
 thousand units remembering that for now 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.620
 the game is available only remembering 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.930
 that for now the game is available 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.330
 only for the 3ds 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.840
 the version of the river follows without a date 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.180
 was defined and the purchase of the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.180
 studio responsible for greater craft 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.000
 microsoft the company disbursed 2 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.310
 million and a half dollars and now owns 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.010
 officially from minecraft only that they 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.500
 reassured the players and affirmed 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840
 that it will remain available and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.690
 receiving updates on all 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.880
 platforms available and the crew asked 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.830
 quite so now you're back here 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.150
 in the grÃªmio bridge a frame that the frame 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.860
 of analysis or better 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.660
 My analysis is what we will check 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.760
 So, how did you get the Haywards Airways game? 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.010
 mix in an amazing way the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 the universe of the franchise the legend of 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.200
 zelda with totally new gameplay 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.390
 inspired by the net wars franchise 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
 The result is a game 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.610
 Dramatic style featuring 13 characters 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.920
 well known in the universe of zelda 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.410
 although in general this type of game is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.900
 well, this factor was well 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.390
 outlined in May hors thanks to 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.700
 number of controllable characters and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.780
 to creative and well made combos 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.970
 special 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.680
 the game keeps the sensation for a long time 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.230
 of a new game 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.390
 It's ten hours of game play and you're not going 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.490
 have a lot of difficulty playing pleasure 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.040
 although you need to think a bit 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.470
 find out how to finalize some bosses 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.490
 in general the level of difficulty is not there 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.190
 so high 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.320
 graphically the game does not make ugly with 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.660
 kandinsky extremely beautiful and 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.710
 well-worked gameplay with the visual 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.290
 great 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.360
 the negative point is for the multiplayer 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.670
 first that you have no online mode and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.340
 local multiplayer the graphics fall 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.100
 absurdly both in resolution and 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.860
 in textures and scrolls until led when 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.290
 many enemies on the screen in general thunderbolt 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.600
 hours will please both zelda fans 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.600
