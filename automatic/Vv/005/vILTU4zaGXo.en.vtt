00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:14.030 

okay<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:04.710> i<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.500> was<00:02:07.680> okay<00:02:09.289> um<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.920> was

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
okay so i think that was okay um it was

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.590 
okay so i think that was okay um it was
funny<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.730> whole<00:02:14.880> time<00:02:15.120> before<00:02:15.569> I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
funny because the whole time before I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.720 
funny because the whole time before I
was<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.050> setting<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.530> up<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.680> like<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.190> minute

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
was like setting it up for like a minute

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.729 
was like setting it up for like a minute
trying<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> figure<00:02:18.480> out<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:19.590> going

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
trying to figure out I know it's going

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.680 
trying to figure out I know it's going
to<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.860> pushed<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.370> way<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> don't<00:02:21.510> know

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
to be pushed this way but I don't know

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.470 
to be pushed this way but I don't know
how<00:02:21.900> far<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.620> i<00:02:23.100> set<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.300> goes

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
how far and i set it up and it goes

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.970 
how far and i set it up and it goes
farther<00:02:24.750> than<00:02:24.900> what<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> thought<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.800> going

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
farther than what I thought it was going

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.290 
farther than what I thought it was going
to<00:02:26.040> go<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:29.040> easy<00:02:29.520> easily

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
to go I think because it's easy easily

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.500 
to go I think because it's easy easily
rebuild<00:02:30.720> 'add<00:02:31.069> rebuildable<00:02:32.069> i'm<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:33.300> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
crashes um that's basically it for this

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.680 
crashes um that's basically it for this
video<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:28.130> hope<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.310> three<00:03:29.580> crashes<00:03:30.060> made<00:03:30.390> for

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
video I hope all three crashes made for

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.950 
video I hope all three crashes made for
