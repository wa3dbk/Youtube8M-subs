00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
seated row but I'm using my body

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.860 
seated row but I'm using my body
momentum<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:26.250> squeeze<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:27.000> step<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.360> 30<00:03:27.600> reps

momentum to squeeze in a step of 30 reps

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.440 
momentum to squeeze in a step of 30 reps
it's<00:03:28.590> an<00:03:28.739> exercise<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.160> I've<00:03:29.880> been<00:03:30.060> doing<00:03:30.300> of

probably last year when I see in the fur

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.090 
probably last year when I see in the fur
the<00:03:33.209> exercise<00:03:33.959> been<00:03:34.170> described<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.709> me<00:03:34.769> first

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
the exercise been described to me first

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.530 
the exercise been described to me first
of<00:03:35.220> all<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.640> thought<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.970> was<00:03:36.060> not<00:03:36.209> gonna<00:03:36.360> be<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
of all I thought it was not gonna be a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.840 
of all I thought it was not gonna be a
benefit<00:03:37.050> at<00:03:37.170> all<00:03:37.320> I'm<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.040> used<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.310> doing<00:03:38.610> a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
benefit at all I'm so used to doing a

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.830 
benefit at all I'm so used to doing a
seated<00:03:39.239> row<00:03:39.680> very<00:03:40.680> similar<00:03:40.980> exercise<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:42.060> lot

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
seated row very similar exercise a lot

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.810 
seated row very similar exercise a lot
more<00:03:43.080> weight<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.590> course<00:03:43.860> I'm<00:03:44.220> trying<00:03:44.670> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
more weight of course I'm trying to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.400 
more weight of course I'm trying to
squeeze<00:03:45.030> at<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.330> top<00:03:45.390> but<00:03:45.810> your<00:03:46.019> body<00:03:46.200> been

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
squeeze at the top but your body been

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.130 
squeeze at the top but your body been
pulled<00:03:46.620> forward<00:03:47.060> once<00:03:48.060> once<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.780> tried<00:03:48.989> this

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
pulled forward once once I tried this

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.350 
pulled forward once once I tried this
exercise<00:03:49.650> again<00:03:49.980> we're<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.519> tree<00:03:50.760> rep<00:03:50.940> ranges

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
exercise again we're a tree rep ranges

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.660 
exercise again we're a tree rep ranges
increased<00:03:52.080> significantly<00:03:53.070> but<00:03:53.310> Europe

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
increased significantly but Europe

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.350 
increased significantly but Europe
allowed<00:03:54.030> us<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.239> try<00:03:55.049> different<00:03:55.440> varied

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
allowed us to try different varied

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.630 
allowed us to try different varied

squeezes full range of motion to keeping

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.949 
squeezes full range of motion to keeping
it<00:03:59.700> short<00:03:59.760> range<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.330> motion<00:04:00.600> then<00:04:00.780> obviously

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
it short range of motion then obviously

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.020 
it short range of motion then obviously
squeezing<00:04:01.590> at<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.769> bottom<00:04:02.130> it's<00:04:02.519> definitely

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
squeezing at the bottom it's definitely

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.420 
squeezing at the bottom it's definitely
helped<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:04.470> it's<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.709> great<00:04:04.980> finishing

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
helped and it's a great finishing

helped and it's a great finishing
exercise<00:04:05.940> puts<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.330> lot<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.540> blood<00:04:06.750> volume<00:04:07.010> into

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
exercise puts a lot of blood volume into

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.000 
exercise puts a lot of blood volume into
your<00:04:08.130> back<00:04:08.340> and<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.299> sort<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.720> helped<00:04:10.230> even<00:04:10.860> in
