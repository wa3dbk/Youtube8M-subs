I'm six one actually

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.839 
I'm six one actually
kind<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.140> average<00:02:13.500> I'd<00:02:13.680> say<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.489> was<00:02:14.670> too

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
kind of average I'd say this was too

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.770 
kind of average I'd say this was too
short<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.540> hung<00:02:16.019> like<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.010> guess<00:02:17.310> mid<00:02:17.970> chest<00:02:18.390> for

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
short it hung like I guess mid chest for

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.630 
short it hung like I guess mid chest for
me<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.410> basically<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.890> was<00:02:19.980> great<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.400> keeping

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
me so basically it was great for keeping

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
me so basically it was great for keeping
my<00:02:20.940> iPhone<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.660> me<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.200> time<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
my iPhone with me all the time but I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
my iPhone with me all the time but I
really<00:02:23.400> couldn't<00:02:23.670> use<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.300> phone<00:02:24.569> while<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
really couldn't use my phone while this

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.350 
really couldn't use my phone while this
was<00:02:25.230> attached<00:02:25.530> especially<00:02:25.769> since<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:27.000> hangs

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
was attached especially since it hangs

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 
was attached especially since it hangs
facing<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.340> imagine<00:02:29.640> this

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
facing down so if you imagine this

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
facing down so if you imagine this
hanging<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:30.540> my<00:02:30.660> chest<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.530> were<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.739> flip

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
hanging for my chest if I were to flip

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.740 
hanging for my chest if I were to flip
it<00:02:32.099> straight<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.370> its<00:02:32.670> upside<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.540> had

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it straight up its upside down so I had

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660 
it straight up its upside down so I had
to<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.049> give<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> some<00:02:34.830> slack<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.129> turn<00:02:35.549> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
to like give it some slack and turn it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.059 
to like give it some slack and turn it
around<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.840> too<00:02:37.110> short<00:02:37.349> people

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
around and it was just too short people

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.530 
around and it was just too short people
that<00:02:38.160> were<00:02:38.250> smaller<00:02:38.549> like<00:02:38.879> my<00:02:39.120> wife<00:02:39.299> or<00:02:39.510> my

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that were smaller like my wife or my

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
that were smaller like my wife or my
daughter<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:40.170> shorter<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.980> were<00:02:41.129> able<00:02:41.280> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
daughter was shorter they were able to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.580 
daughter was shorter they were able to
actually<00:02:41.819> keep<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.170> use<00:02:43.379> their

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
actually keep this on and use their

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.530 
actually keep this on and use their
phone<00:02:43.769> at<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> same<00:02:44.220> time<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.700> my<00:02:45.120> only<00:02:45.269> point

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
phone at the same time so my only point

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.699 
phone at the same time so my only point
about<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> lanyard<00:02:46.079> is<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.319> wish<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.560> was<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
about the lanyard is I wish it was a

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.110 
about the lanyard is I wish it was a
little<00:02:46.739> bit<00:02:47.010> longer<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.700> you're<00:02:47.819> tall

little bit longer and if you're tall

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
little bit longer and if you're tall
you're<00:02:48.780> probably<00:02:48.989> not<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.590> order<00:02:49.829> this

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you're probably not going to order this

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.589
