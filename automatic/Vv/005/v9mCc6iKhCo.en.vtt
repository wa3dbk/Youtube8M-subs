actually we did get busted in a sense I

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.710 
actually we did get busted in a sense I
mean<00:00:11.230> it<00:00:11.350> was<00:00:11.549> it<00:00:12.549> was<00:00:12.700> a<00:00:12.730> local<00:00:13.030> contest<00:00:13.570> in

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:13.720 
mean it was it was a local contest in

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.800 
mean it was it was a local contest in
Boulder<00:00:14.110> it<00:00:14.860> was<00:00:15.070> done<00:00:16.000> on<00:00:16.150> this<00:00:16.270> road<00:00:16.540> called

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
Boulder it was done on this road called

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.660 
Boulder it was done on this road called
Columbine<00:00:17.380> where<00:00:17.619> we<00:00:17.740> skated<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.220> lot<00:00:18.400> it<00:00:18.580> was

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
Columbine where we skated a lot it was

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.359 
Columbine where we skated a lot it was
just<00:00:19.060> kind<00:00:19.240> of<00:00:19.300> a<00:00:19.450> a<00:00:19.720> gentle<00:00:20.680> slope<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.279> it

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
just kind of a a gentle slope and it

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.400 
just kind of a a gentle slope and it
probably<00:00:21.550> went<00:00:21.849> for<00:00:22.090> five<00:00:22.960> or<00:00:23.110> six<00:00:23.140> blocks

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
probably went for five or six blocks

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.470 
probably went for five or six blocks
there<00:00:24.040> was<00:00:24.160> very<00:00:24.369> little<00:00:24.610> traffic<00:00:24.849> on<00:00:25.149> it<00:00:25.300> so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
there was very little traffic on it so

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.729 
there was very little traffic on it so
we<00:00:25.630> would<00:00:25.750> always<00:00:25.899> go<00:00:26.110> there<00:00:26.259> and<00:00:26.410> set<00:00:26.590> up

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
we would always go there and set up

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.889 
we would always go there and set up
slalom<00:00:27.009> courses<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:27.730> stuff<00:00:27.910> so<00:00:28.239> and<00:00:28.599> I<00:00:28.840> don't

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
slalom courses and stuff so and I don't

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.130 
slalom courses and stuff so and I don't
remember<00:00:29.110> who<00:00:29.410> organized<00:00:29.919> that<00:00:30.070> contest<00:00:30.669> but

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
remember who organized that contest but

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.979 
remember who organized that contest but
it<00:00:32.140> was<00:00:32.410> basically<00:00:33.130> slalom<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.420> down<00:00:34.690> hill

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
it was basically slalom and a down hill

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.240 
it was basically slalom and a down hill
and<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:37.030> knew<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.390> wheels<00:00:37.630> were<00:00:38.289> way<00:00:38.710> faster

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
and we knew the wheels were way faster

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.860 
and we knew the wheels were way faster
than<00:00:39.399> anything<00:00:39.640> out<00:00:39.910> there<00:00:40.120> but<00:00:40.329> they<00:00:40.449> were<00:00:40.510> so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
than anything out there but they were so

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.700 
than anything out there but they were so
fast<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.699> know<00:00:43.019> you<00:00:44.019> couldn't<00:00:44.410> ride

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
fast that you know you couldn't ride

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.410 
fast that you know you couldn't ride
them<00:00:44.920> standing<00:00:45.429> up<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.730> normal<00:00:46.030> way<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.300> you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
them standing up the normal way that you

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.029 
them standing up the normal way that you
would<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:47.079> know<00:00:47.109> it<00:00:47.289> were<00:00:47.379> like<00:00:47.530> on<00:00:47.679> a<00:00:47.710> slalom

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
would you know it were like on a slalom

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.639 
would you know it were like on a slalom
course<00:00:48.219> or<00:00:48.609> anything<00:00:48.789> so<00:00:49.269> we<00:00:49.510> found<00:00:50.410> this

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
course or anything so we found this

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.160 
course or anything so we found this
naive<00:00:50.920> I<00:00:51.579> think<00:00:51.940> he<00:00:52.030> was<00:00:52.179> like<00:00:52.300> 14<00:00:52.809> year<00:00:53.019> old

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
naive I think he was like 14 year old

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.220 
naive I think he was like 14 year old
kid<00:00:53.440> who<00:00:54.100> who<00:00:54.760> would<00:00:54.940> ride<00:00:55.210> it<00:00:55.390> laying<00:00:55.780> down<00:00:55.989> on

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
kid who who would ride it laying down on

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.060 
kid who who would ride it laying down on
his<00:00:56.350> board<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.890> we<00:00:57.429> gave<00:00:57.640> him<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.940> wheels<00:00:58.149> and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
his board and we gave him the wheels and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.680 
his board and we gave him the wheels and
we<00:01:00.070> actually<00:01:00.489> chopped<00:01:00.879> them<00:01:01.089> off<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.300> little

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
we actually chopped them off a little

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.899 
we actually chopped them off a little
bit<00:01:01.809> because<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.129> original<00:01:03.579> design

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
bit because the the original design

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.149 
bit because the the original design
which<00:01:04.089> was<00:01:04.269> like<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> power<00:01:04.690> pole<00:01:04.960> was<00:01:05.140> so<00:01:05.440> thin

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
which was like a power pole was so thin

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.810 
which was like a power pole was so thin
at<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> edge<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.610> was<00:01:06.940> just<00:01:07.180> floppy<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
at the edge it was just floppy and you

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.319 
at the edge it was just floppy and you
know<00:01:09.939> he<00:01:10.119> got<00:01:10.270> on<00:01:10.540> there<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.740> think<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
know he got on there and I think the the

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:14.999 
know he got on there and I think the the
downhill<00:01:13.570> was<00:01:13.899> probably<00:01:14.229> three<00:01:14.560> blocks<00:01:14.860> long

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
downhill was probably three blocks long

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.810 
downhill was probably three blocks long
and<00:01:15.549> he<00:01:15.670> won<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.720> contest<00:01:17.140> by<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.890> don't<00:01:18.700> know<00:01:18.759> I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
and he won the contest by I don't know I

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.100 
and he won the contest by I don't know I
think<00:01:18.909> he<00:01:19.119> crossed<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.479> finish<00:01:19.570> line<00:01:19.990> before

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
think he crossed the finish line before

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.990 
think he crossed the finish line before
anybody<00:01:20.619> else<00:01:20.799> was<00:01:21.040> halfway<00:01:21.399> down<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.729> course

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
anybody else was halfway down the course

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.539 
anybody else was halfway down the course
you<00:01:22.240> know<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.450> everybody<00:01:22.689> was<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.549> that's
