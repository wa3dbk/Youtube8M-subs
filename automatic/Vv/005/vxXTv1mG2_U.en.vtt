00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello for this set use the regular type 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.359
 translucent and cut it in the form of 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.970
 peak thus forming my stilettos not 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:20.350
 because I like it but because it avoids 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.290
 I have that kind of guy on hand 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.570
 I'm going to use these three acrylics that 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.490
 are the black the silver and a mixture of 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.430
 gliders and of course the crystalline 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.640
 to encapsulate the glitter and protect my 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 nail bed like here when I use 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 dark colors always try to put 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.330
 one capita sometimes I forget to 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.580
 no I am smearing me because of my natural nail 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.790
 by itself it's already fine pores and it's 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.239
 easy spot the problem of when I 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.510
 I used this type of tips and cut it on 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.159
 kind liked it and cut it in peak but I 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.900
 I despair and I try to do it very 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.580
 fast and I always have left 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.930
 small but I agree as I apply 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.790
 the acrylics I'm forming the structure 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.299
 of the nail if I see that on one side I 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.490
 I am very crooked or very like cut 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.140
 I'm also crushing the acrylic 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.750
 so that it forms that piece of nail that I 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.520
 I took it with the scissors very well 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.520
 since in this part I show you a 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.899
 wire that is what I'm going to do 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 the marks of the two ones these in 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.400
 where he applied this black color 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.650
 the acrylic I apply it thick here 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.130
 as nothing else is the tip if I'm going to be able 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.670
 finish the full point and do the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.260
 marks as you see here I do not use thread 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.840
 because I was doing a little bit 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.400
 as unstable and apart almost not 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.159
 I noticed the marquitas I wanted a 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.679
 deeper mark 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.310
 most of the time you're going to have to 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:07.840
 fix it with the brush 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.520
 As the wire is very thick, it leaves 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.280
 as raised the acrylic there is that 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.980
 fix it before it dries and I'll 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.830
 make a complete nail therefore I 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.870
 I'm going to have to go half and half if I do not 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.450
 is going to take out the acrylic at least 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.950
 this I have dry very fast is more 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.590
 dry the acrylic and I will not reach 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.750
 make the print up down so 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.370
 here I stop the part is drying up 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.860
 from above if they are fixed it is getting 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 for here 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.270
 and I have to start doing the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.140
 brands up here 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.930
 I'm going down 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.000
 after he has finished this part he applied 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.510
 on the tip to the rest of the acrylic and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.340
 I will continue with the marks before 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.770
 that dry I give a retouch with the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.430
 brush if a bit was left 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.860
 crooked or some badly made picture 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.570
 after and slime and pull or as you can see 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.510
 here the nails of these of squares 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.060
 because if they are not very virtuous but 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.780
 not so deep that you're going to damage the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.739
 impressions I will use a matte glaze 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.620
 for two of the nails that are this 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.630
 silver and thumb good ones 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.260
 silver as a gray and marry 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.689
 gray 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.120
 so let's leave it in gray and the gel 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.579
 ultraviolet obviously in those that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.730
 they have free and the black squares for 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.540
 that look like skin like that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.940
 bright and then I put a few pebbles 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.690
 in each corner that ends a small square 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.500
 and with the silver acrylic formed 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.150
 cracks are not the big thing because the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.890
 forms with acrylic is a little bit more 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.130
 complicated 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.130
 but that's what I did on my finger 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.110
 it's all boys and girls I already shared 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.970
 the last set that I was doing making them 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.190
 I also tone you use something 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.739
 fresher or more to their style and they are not 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:21.799
