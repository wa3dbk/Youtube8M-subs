00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello very good everyone I am marbles and 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.000
 I'm here in this video to try 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.529
 offer you a solution to a problem that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 seems to be very typical in league 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.660
 of legends is the problem of loading the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.719
 leasing and is that you stay in this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 let's say we give you double click 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 the ico fleiss jens icon comes out and here 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.840
 it takes a lot of minutes until you 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.490
 there is an error in which you do not load 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 what would be the launcher that is this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 right where the step that I am where 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.939
 we would give him to play the options would go 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.819
 of the registry and we would enter 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.559
 directly to the customer voucher lol has 

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:36.420
 let's say that three phases the launcher the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.379
 clicker and what would be then the game in 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.699
 Chinese for when we play good for the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.039
 that you have problems of the game and not 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.600
 you know or in the game are the 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.699
 options here to repair os 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 I recommend that we repair the game 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.559
 siegel if this is the step from which 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.539
 you have problems or if the step is more 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 advance if it's on the client if 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.249
 you enter the launcher up here in what 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.389
 what would be the gears you can also 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.159
 disconnect what would be the peer-to-peer 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:03.809
 that sometimes also gives problems and over 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.390
 everything to repair that really what's 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.409
 repair let's say the game would make a 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.569
 scanning of all files 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.340
 we have and I would look what is 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:14.159
 corrupt and replace it with one that does not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.899
 I agree it well let's do 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.090
 the solution the first step we have 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.500
 what to do is give the secondary button to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.429
 icon of the ico play is to give 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 properties is worth in direct access we 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.950
 we would go to advanced options and execute 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.109
 as an administrator worth this is one of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.200
 the most typical solutions let's say 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.729
 we could also make you debt with 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.729
 sorry to go to the compatibility tab 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.729
 and offer it in this way compatibility 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.649
 run this program in mode 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.579
 compatibility for windows xp service 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.240
 pack 3 we would give you to apply continue and 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.280
 accept this is true of many of those who 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.710
 the problem of blocking 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.039
 you will only solve it if this does not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.789
 it works then we would have to go to 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:07.239
 things greater than for example looking 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.950
 in the forum threads of licop legends 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.739
 the user the little one that many people 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 he has thanked you for this solution 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.819
 proposes this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.180
 young always talk to me when when 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.730
 I'm doing good videos what to delete 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.160
 some files that we are going to follow the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.590
 steps, we'll have to go to the route of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.730
 riot access that river testa en riot 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.370
 games dick of legends rats ok let's go to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.409
 see the rights project access path 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.269
 and the air client is worth and then release and 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.549
 always the highest number the most number 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.680
 high in this case would be the 91 all this 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.150
 are versions of the game then read the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.849
 highest number refers to the last 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250
 version that we are working 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.430
 then our case would be 91 and 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.400
 you delete these files worth these 2 this 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.040
 and this is worth this would cause the game that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.720
 Once, if you do not have a job, they are 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.900
 the corrupt ones let's say it would be a 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.510
 manual repair okay then we would have 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.120
 that go to the deploy folder that would be 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.490
 this one and erase what the folder would be 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.000
 meta clip info 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.240
 mod 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.950
 the files and click the click 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.920
 dot excel swf and the local ts itself 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.690
 ok this would be what would be what you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.470
 I said before a manual repair 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.610
 will force the game to be downloaded again 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.800
 is now those files 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.110
 once we execute it once we 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.430
 we put this and execute the program on 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.170
 program will take a little bit in going back to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.790
 download the files from the server 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.790
 and theoretically we will have made a 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.920
 manual repair this theoretically 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.350
 it has to work in the description os 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 I'll leave the link to the forum or else and 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.060
 I will also stick these steps because they are 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.830
 very very simple theoretically worth 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.080
 what I told you before executing the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.060
 the minecraft as administrator and with 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.989
 compatibility with windows 7 xp service 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.640
 pack 3 works and if we say that your 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.989
 case is a little more extreme then 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360
 we will have to do the manual repair 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.590
 here I leave the steps I hope that you 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320
 have solved life to those who 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.820
 you are extremely concerned with your 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.010
 lykov lexis because it makes a better 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.260
 month or a week or two days or one hour 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.000
 in which you can not play and that this if you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.190
 has solved please 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.290
 tell me in the comments always 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.780
 It's cool to help people and know what 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.200
 good greetings and until the next video 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.200
 see you later
