00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.099 
actually cook it and then you still have
to<00:02:02.579> watch<00:02:02.789> all<00:02:03.030> those<00:02:03.210> dishes<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.990> them

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
to watch all those dishes or get them

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.300 
to watch all those dishes or get them
prepped<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.329> put<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
prepped so you can put them in the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.999 
prepped so you can put them in the
dishwasher<00:02:08.509> now<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
dishwasher now this is the this is the

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
dishwasher now this is the this is the
screen<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.810> makes<00:02:13.019> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
screen and this is what makes the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.280 
screen and this is what makes the
Breville<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.849> good<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.540> much<00:02:15.720> better<00:02:15.989> than

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
Breville so good and so much better than

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.830 
Breville so good and so much better than
a<00:02:16.349> lot<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> competition<00:02:17.569> all<00:02:18.569> those

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
a lot of the competition all those

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.680 
a lot of the competition all those
little<00:02:19.019> tiny<00:02:19.319> blades<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.610> there<00:02:20.849> because

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
little tiny blades in there because

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.440 
little tiny blades in there because
those<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.379> chew<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.830> food<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.760> macerate

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
those actually chew the food or macerate

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.440 
those actually chew the food or macerate
it<00:02:24.480> into<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> fine<00:02:25.260> pulp<00:02:25.739> then<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.640> moisture<00:02:26.819> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
it into a fine pulp then the moisture is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.979 
it into a fine pulp then the moisture is
slung<00:02:28.140> out<00:02:28.319> around<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.860> sides<00:02:29.190> now<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.810> going

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
slung out around the sides now I'm going

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.830 
slung out around the sides now I'm going
to<00:02:31.049> let<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.500> sit<00:02:32.069> for<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.310> second<00:02:32.730> because

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
to let that sit for a second because

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.120 
to let that sit for a second because
that<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.019> going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> take<00:02:34.440> just<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.829> minute<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that is going to take just a minute to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.449 
that is going to take just a minute to
get<00:02:35.400> done<00:02:36.079> but<00:02:37.250> you<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.640> main<00:02:38.849> container

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
get done but you see the main container

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.580 
get done but you see the main container
that<00:02:41.459> wasn't<00:02:41.849> hard<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.360> want<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.110> make<00:02:43.200> sure<00:02:43.230> we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that wasn't hard I want to make sure we

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.140 
that wasn't hard I want to make sure we
get<00:02:43.769> up<00:02:43.890> around<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.459> lip<00:02:46.819> since<00:02:47.819> there's<00:02:48.000> no

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
get up around the lip since there's no

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.819 
get up around the lip since there's no
meat<00:02:48.360> product<00:02:48.780> obviously<00:02:48.989> passing<00:02:49.620> through

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
meat product obviously passing through

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:50.839 
meat product obviously passing through
there<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.129> really<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.640> worry<00:02:50.760> about

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
there you really have to worry about

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.550 
there you really have to worry about
munching<00:02:51.299> away<00:02:51.420> contamination<00:02:52.319> if<00:02:52.440> you've

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
munching away contamination if you've

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.220 
munching away contamination if you've
watched<00:02:52.799> your<00:02:53.010> produce<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.190> we'll<00:02:56.430> set<00:02:56.670> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
watched your produce so we'll set that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.069 
watched your produce so we'll set that
over<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:59.420> now<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:02.480> think<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:03.900> this

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
over there now I think I know what this

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.740 
over there now I think I know what this
is<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.790> Breville<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:05.940> kind<00:03:06.180> enough<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.480> send

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
is for Breville was kind enough to send
