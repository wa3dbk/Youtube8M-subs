00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.259
 different ensemble that anyway

 that the world does not re-enter 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.490
 these three alliances are supported 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.560
 fight for dominance in the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.239
 region cerro del only if an alliance 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.190
 has assumed the imperial city it is 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.020
 you will be able to do the first month of ball 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.510
 and attack his army 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.099
 for all kerber only pvp out there 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.930
 only in seoul instead of if you do not 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:32.080
 want to participate in the war of the learned 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.000
 your style just stays away for audel 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.890
 who comes to you for the first time 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810
 downright of the numerous fortresses 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.580
 watchtower and strategic nodes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 slain see max is this 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.610
 area as big as the entire world 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.930
 be from oblivion 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.239
 there is plenty of room for many 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.160
 schänkel now follows but a little 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.319
 Dampers fight for the fortifications 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.360
 are instantiated pointed designed xamax 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.489
 for the following reason excessive lex and 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.350
 unfair fighting situations for example 10 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.330
 around 100 should be avoided 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.730
 but do not be afraid of that 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.530
 Battlegrounds are at 200 versus 200 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.180
 player designed when the instance full 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 occupied is simply a new one 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.299
 Instance created the results 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.220
 both of them influence the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.750
 the game world has exactly how that in detail 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.370
 looks to be yet to show 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.040
 the medium cds becomes a sticking point 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.480
 the pvp dispute any alliance 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.519
 populate your bastions over one 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.660
 supply line with new soldiers becomes 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.519
 the way cut off and the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.530
 must severed supply lines this 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.910
 to be reconquered first or you 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.200
 just have to go longer 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.000
 what a tactical run you 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.230
 disadvantage aggravates the attacks of yours 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.150
 Enemies will not be long in coming 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.040
 let to take a castle is like 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.420
 the king to help when a 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.890
 group of players long enough in the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.870
 innermost area of ​​a fortress against 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.489
 the enemies claimed this as 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.170
 However, it is not easy to assume 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.579
 Use the turtles tactics 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.470
 after all, your enemy is trying 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.010
 catapults and hamburg the fortress too 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.660
 conquer 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.130
 the situation will be a lot 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.480
 harder if the other two 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.950
 alliances against you to one 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.140
 unite alliance of purpose 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 you can also overrun your position 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.950
 you already enter from level 10 where 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.049
 zenimax would like to implement something special 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.970
 so that even praise can get involved in 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.890
 you get civil differently than in the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.870
 other areas of it are special 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.060
 battlefield experience so you spurt 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.620
 in no time on the maximum level 50 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 Nevertheless, a classically leveled 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 character to be a lot stronger than 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.260
 a pvp character despite the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.190
 installation is the pvp system though 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.810
 not necessarily new 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.400
 It will set standards at the same time 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.480
 but an elementary part of the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.769
 its world of esb 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.570
 along with the many different ones 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.040
 moods your opponent down before her 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.480
 provided new challenges 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.250
 you can then have the class of her 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.990
 that is, enemies do not know which ones 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.550
 tricks he still has in stock so who 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.110
 believes to dominate his character 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.370
 can in the pvp again on the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.960
 put all the hard test 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.730
 because in the battle for cero deal is 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.010
 really separated the wheat from the chaff 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.690
 so much for the pvp system writes us 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.490
 in the comments what else you do 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.530
 want to see or hear and give us 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.400
 Something thumbs up we are out and about 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.400
 say at buy
