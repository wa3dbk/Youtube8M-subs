or even if you if you want to count a
centre-forward<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:26.220> well<00:02:26.400> obviously<00:02:27.000> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
centre-forward as well obviously I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.550 
centre-forward as well obviously I
wouldn't<00:02:27.480> recommend<00:02:27.810> putting<00:02:28.110> them<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
wouldn't recommend putting them in a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.650 
wouldn't recommend putting them in a
center<00:02:29.250> defensive<00:02:29.670> midfielder<00:02:30.060> role<00:02:30.239> but

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
center defensive midfielder role but

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.390 
center defensive midfielder role but
that<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.989> pretty<00:02:31.230> much<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:32.040> review

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400

trying<00:02:38.280> him<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.880> would<00:02:39.120> have<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.480> say<00:02:39.510> yes

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
trying him out I would have to say yes

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.199

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
central midfielder because I didn't even

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.539 
central midfielder because I didn't even
really<00:02:46.200> play<00:02:46.470> him<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.739> sentimental<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> pay

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
them as a cent attacking midfielder and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.309 
them as a cent attacking midfielder and
the<00:02:49.590> striker<00:02:50.040> sometimes<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.940> video<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.019> I

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
the striker sometimes in this video so I

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.130 
the striker sometimes in this video so I
I<00:02:52.860> don't<00:02:53.220> know<00:02:53.340> man<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:53.970> i<00:02:54.299> would<00:02:54.989> i

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I don't know man it's like i would i

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.300 
I don't know man it's like i would i
would<00:02:55.170> recommend<00:02:55.739> him<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.190> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
would recommend him if you have the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.740 
would recommend him if you have the
money<00:02:56.340> he's<00:02:56.940> probably<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.569> best

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
money he's probably one of the best

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.270 
money he's probably one of the best
sentiment<00:02:58.200> filters<00:02:58.470> out<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:58.769> if<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.040> don't

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
sentiment filters out there if you don't

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.180 
sentiment filters out there if you don't
obviously<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.120> would<00:03:00.390> settle<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:00.900> less<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
obviously I would settle for less so the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.259
