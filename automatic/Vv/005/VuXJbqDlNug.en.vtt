doing the Dermaroller we just did the
PRP<00:00:13.139> injections<00:00:14.009> platelet-rich<00:00:14.549> plasma<00:00:14.780> with

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
PRP injections platelet-rich plasma with

their stem cell-like effect with the
growth<00:00:17.580> factors<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.300> will<00:00:18.449> be<00:00:18.630> released

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
growth factors which will be released

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.410 
growth factors which will be released
over<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> next<00:00:19.770> two<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:19.949> three<00:00:20.070> weeks<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.640> now

over the next two or three weeks and now
we're<00:00:21.600> doing<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> derma<00:00:22.350> roller<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.800> I'm

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
we're doing the derma roller and I'm

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.349 
we're doing the derma roller and I'm
going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.430> little<00:00:23.670> closer<00:00:23.970> for

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
going to put that a little closer for

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.900 
going to put that a little closer for
the<00:00:24.900> camera<00:00:25.439> we<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.310> needles

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the camera we see these little needles

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.820 
the camera we see these little needles
and<00:00:27.090> he<00:00:27.510> doesn't<00:00:27.810> feel<00:00:28.019> any<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:28.560> they're

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and he doesn't feel any of these they're

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.189 
and he doesn't feel any of these they're
one<00:00:28.980> millimeter<00:00:29.429> needles<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.420> they're<00:00:31.019> going

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
one millimeter needles and they're going

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.290 
one millimeter needles and they're going
right<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.949> help<00:00:32.160> stimulate<00:00:32.399> follicle

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
right down to help stimulate follicle

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.389 
right down to help stimulate follicle
growth<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.590> mix<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> PRP<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.850> put<00:00:36.090> in

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
growth and to mix the PRP that we put in

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.060 
growth and to mix the PRP that we put in
platelet-rich<00:00:38.399> plasma<00:00:38.520> growth<00:00:39.300> factors

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
platelet-rich plasma growth factors

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
platelet-rich plasma growth factors
it'll<00:00:41.070> mix<00:00:41.309> well<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.670> into<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.780> little

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it'll mix well now into all the little

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.610 
it'll mix well now into all the little
spaces<00:00:43.320> where<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.160> our<00:00:45.079> little<00:00:46.079> needles

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
spaces where are our little needles

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
spaces where are our little needles
create<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.399> needle<00:00:47.760> marks<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.870> will

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
create little needle marks and that will

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
create little needle marks and that will
provoke<00:00:49.620> healing<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:50.969> areas

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
provoke healing in all of those areas

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
provoke healing in all of those areas
around<00:00:51.600> his<00:00:51.899> scalp<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> our<00:00:53.160> plan<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.610> course

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
around his scalp and our plan of course

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
around his scalp and our plan of course
is<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.680> stimulate<00:00:55.680> hair<00:00:56.370> growth<00:00:56.430> therefore

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
is to stimulate hair growth therefore

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.189 
is to stimulate hair growth therefore
he's<00:00:57.480> lost<00:00:57.719> it

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
he's lost it

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
he's lost it
and<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> right<00:01:00.239> time<00:01:00.270> with<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> young

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and this is the right time with a young

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.740 
and this is the right time with a young
man<00:01:01.320> before<00:01:01.949> all<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> hair<00:01:03.000> follicles<00:01:03.600> are

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
man before all of the hair follicles are

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100 
man before all of the hair follicles are
shut<00:01:03.989> off<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:05.100> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.700> stimulate<00:01:06.390> regrowth

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
shut off we want to stimulate regrowth

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.620 
shut off we want to stimulate regrowth
and<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.939> significant

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and we find will see significant

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
and we find will see significant
regrowth<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> next<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.770> three<00:01:10.979> four

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
regrowth over the next two three four

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
regrowth over the next two three four
months<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.659> may<00:01:12.840> treat<00:01:13.140> him<00:01:13.350> again

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
months and then we may treat him again

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.240 
months and then we may treat him again
in<00:01:13.950> six<00:01:14.369> months<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.409> wait<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.189> he

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
in six months we just wait to see how he

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
in six months we just wait to see how he
does<00:01:17.490> some<00:01:17.909> people<00:01:18.210> are<00:01:18.299> having<00:01:18.479> treatments

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
does some people are having treatments

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.679 
does some people are having treatments
like<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.470> every<00:01:19.830> six<00:01:20.189> months<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> new

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
like this every six months for a new

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.010 
like this every six months for a new
hair<00:01:22.229> growth<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.759> maintain<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.840> growth

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hair growth and to maintain the growth

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
hair growth and to maintain the growth
