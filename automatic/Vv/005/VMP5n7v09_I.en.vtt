00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.240
 My name is Wetzel and I am 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.240
 photographer 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.050
 i work as a photojournalist that has 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.320
 with my camera the stories 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.170
 I tell others to try 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.310
 my stories or my products 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.640
 always to the people at the center 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.750
 move 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.870
 that means even if he is not always in the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.730
 picture is in the background 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 always about the person in what he does 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 what it has for impact too 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.680
 Especially with portraits is natural 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.330
 incredibly important that you too 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 let's see how far you can go 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.010
 how mischa tests is whether you are exactly 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.410
 on quiet and short 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.940
 help zoom in are 36 megapixel 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.220
 incredibly good for just that sharpness too 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.860
 check the magnifying function on the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.540
 lcd-display helps me with that 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.850
 sharper where I put them 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.710
 would like to have 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.710
 the focus beijing reaffirms 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.890
 this selection itself was very little 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.550
 light is he incredible detail i 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.550
 Watch yourself 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.899
 especially if you again portraits 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.820
 Also a computer can be seen 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.310
 just part of the time is enough 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.500
 pictures with the change 30 megapixel are 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.969
 and you see the reforms the cantons 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.009
 have the eye we did not shoot 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.110
 as it is intended in the portrait 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.170
 he really finds it at the alpha 7 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.240
 wonderful when I report 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.640
 take pictures with my camera is for 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.829
 me very important that the autofocus good 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.109
 on the one hand, I have it with me 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.149
 he just a7 to loosen it autofokus 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.649
 if people make me fast 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.470
 I move with me too 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.950
 Move the sharpness with always wanders that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.950
 is very helpful 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.439
 Personally, it also helps me with one 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.090
 reportage work 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.650
 to use this size of the camera because 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.319
 It just does not make you so noticeable 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.209
 is in comparison to big ones 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.549
 Maybe that is 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.319
 here much more handy and still 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.909
 had no losses at all 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.909
 picture quality or performance 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.900
 cool 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.980
