00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
I was a little bit disappointed because

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.000 
I was a little bit disappointed because
to<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.730> by<00:02:12.060> far<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.630> best<00:02:12.959> test<00:02:13.500> on<00:02:13.709> him

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to me it was by far my best test on him

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.460 
to me it was by far my best test on him
it<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.459> first<00:02:14.640> time<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.180> actually<00:02:15.260> got<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
it was the first time we actually got to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.729 
it was the first time we actually got to
flying<00:02:16.860> changes<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> test<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:19.350> thought

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
flying changes in the test and I thought

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.920 
flying changes in the test and I thought
actually<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.700> lot<00:02:20.820> more<00:02:20.880> consistent<00:02:21.570> than<00:02:21.720> what

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
actually a lot more consistent than what

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390 
actually a lot more consistent than what
we<00:02:22.080> usually<00:02:22.110> get<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:22.620> were<00:02:22.709> no<00:02:22.860> major<00:02:23.040> bald

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.729 
we usually get there were no major bald
ones<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> could<00:02:24.239> tell<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:25.110> he<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> bit

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
ones that I could tell but he is a bit

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.830 
ones that I could tell but he is a bit
unsteady<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.390> nothing

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.130 
own tune in his head that he goes to
that's<00:03:39.820> exactly<00:03:40.000> what<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.390> look<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
that's exactly what it look like and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.920 
that's exactly what it look like and
then<00:03:41.500> padding<00:03:41.980> here<00:03:42.250> looked<00:03:42.730> fantastic<00:03:43.120> until

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
then padding here looked fantastic until

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.990 
then padding here looked fantastic until
the<00:03:44.050> double<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> corners<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.980> mean<00:03:45.130> he<00:03:45.760> was

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the double the corners I mean he was

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.949 
the double the corners I mean he was
years<00:03:46.480> grave<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.200> I<00:03:47.380> think<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:48.750> trying<00:03:49.750> to

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
years grave and I think just trying to

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.530 
years grave and I think just trying to
get<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.200> time<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:50.680> him<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.400> had<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.360> that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
get the time on him and had a bit that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.080 
get the time on him and had a bit that
was<00:03:52.690> probably<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.500> bit<00:03:53.709> too<00:03:53.739> strong<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:57.459> started

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
was probably a bit too strong it started

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.940 
was probably a bit too strong it started
building<00:03:58.870> up<00:03:58.989> as<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> got<00:03:59.560> about<00:03:59.769> three

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
building up as I got about three

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.860 
building up as I got about three
quarters<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.400> way<00:04:00.519> around<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.910> course<00:04:01.150> they

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
quarters the way around the course they

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.840 
quarters the way around the course they
don't<00:04:02.019> think<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.320> address<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.340> fact<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:03.670> I

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
don't think I address the fact that I

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.979 
don't think I address the fact that I
was<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.800> little<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.970> bit<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.450> what<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.810> was

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
was just a little a bit of what I was

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.390 
was just a little a bit of what I was
doing<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.380> dressage<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.709> think<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.130> kind<00:04:09.370> of

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
doing in the dressage I think it kind of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.650 
doing in the dressage I think it kind of
carried<00:04:09.730> over<00:04:09.850> yeah<00:04:12.780> for<00:04:13.780> sure<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.410> then<00:04:14.530> yeah

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
carried over yeah for sure and then yeah

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.479 
carried over yeah for sure and then yeah
he<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:16.989> he<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.500> good<00:04:17.769> just<00:04:17.979> that<00:04:18.190> we<00:04:18.370> just
