00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.720 
going to go and you're going to just go
to<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> map<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.189> you're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.489> run

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
to the map then you're going to run

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.530 
to the map then you're going to run
straight<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:16.999> these<00:02:17.999> are<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.209> two<00:02:18.389> things

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
straight up these are the two things

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.420 
straight up these are the two things
that<00:02:18.659> can<00:02:18.840> happen<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.169> can<00:02:19.409> go<00:02:19.529> up<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:20.069> and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
that can happen you can go up this and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.740 
that can happen you can go up this and
slide<00:02:20.969> down<00:02:20.999> like

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
slide down like

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.720 
slide down like
about<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.470> got<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> show<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.610> guys

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
about to do got you to show you guys

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
about to do got you to show you guys
what<00:02:24.000> happens<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.870> too<00:02:25.020> steep<00:02:25.230> or

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
what happens with when it's too steep or

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170 
what happens with when it's too steep or
you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.070> into<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.430> little<00:02:26.550> black<00:02:26.850> hole

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
you can go into that little black hole

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.240 
you can go into that little black hole
so<00:02:27.540> either<00:02:28.470> you're<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> slide<00:02:29.190> down

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
and if you go into the hole you die so

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.590 
and if you go into the hole you die so
that's<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.370> very<00:02:38.850> annoying<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.420> just

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
that's kind of very annoying so just

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.100 
that's kind of very annoying so just
make<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.080> run<00:02:40.260> jump<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:41.160> over<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:42.110> go

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
make a little run jump get over it go

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.870 
make a little run jump get over it go
ahead<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.590> explore<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.430> want<00:02:44.640> just

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
ahead and explore that if you want just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.820 
ahead and explore that if you want just
be<00:02:45.060> careful<00:02:45.510> about<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.230> over<00:02:46.440> corners

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
be careful about going over corners

where<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.040> can't<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.459> below<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.850> because

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
where you can't see below you because

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.750 
where you can't see below you because
like<00:02:48.330> right<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.190> could<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.250> gone<00:02:50.430> off<00:02:50.640> an

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
like right here I could have gone off an

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.120 
like right here I could have gone off an
edge<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.150> wouldn't<00:02:51.360> even<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.720> known<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:52.200> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
edge and wouldn't even have known it so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.330 
edge and wouldn't even have known it so
go<00:02:54.030> out<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:55.560> I'm<00:02:55.680> checking<00:02:55.980> for<00:02:56.220> all

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
go out there see I'm checking for all

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.400 
go out there see I'm checking for all
the<00:02:56.489> little<00:02:57.060> edges<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.570> can't<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:57.989> below<00:02:58.200> me

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the little edges that can't see below me

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.130 
the little edges that can't see below me
and<00:02:58.880> right<00:02:59.880> here<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.450> fall<00:03:00.660> through<00:03:00.690> so

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and right here you can fall through so

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.690 
and right here you can fall through so
just<00:03:01.320> do<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> little<00:03:01.650> run<00:03:01.920> jump<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.280> you're<00:03:02.580> not

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
just do a little run jump and you're not

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.590 
just do a little run jump and you're not
going<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.180> you're<00:03:03.270> going<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.540> able

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
to make it but just make a little run

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.170 
to make it but just make a little run
jump<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.310> can<00:03:08.489> walk<00:03:08.670> up<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.000> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
jump and you can you can walk up this I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.790 
jump and you can you can walk up this I
was<00:03:09.630> pretty<00:03:09.810> surprised<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.530> could<00:03:10.680> walk

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
then go all the way to this little peek

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.870 
then go all the way to this little peek
right<00:03:22.680> here<00:03:22.920> because<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.459> actually<00:03:23.760> the
