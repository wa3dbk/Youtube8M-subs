know<00:04:44.470> well<00:04:45.470> Bunty<00:04:45.919> you<00:04:46.250> did<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.490> good<00:04:46.640> review

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
know well Bunty you did a good review

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.620 
know well Bunty you did a good review
and<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:48.490> those<00:04:49.490> are<00:04:49.520> probably<00:04:50.330> three<00:04:52.630> design

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
and I those are probably three design

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:03.580 
and I those are probably three design
flaws<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:56.419> would<00:04:57.140> agree<00:04:57.260> with<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.560> but<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:02.590> don't

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
flaws I would agree with you but I don't

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.040 
flaws I would agree with you but I don't
they<00:05:04.280> should<00:05:04.580> have<00:05:04.669> actually<00:05:04.910> flipped<00:05:05.900> it

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
they should have actually flipped it

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.150 
they should have actually flipped it
around<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.760> would<00:05:07.940> be<00:05:08.710> backwards<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.070> you

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
around so it would be backwards so you

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.430 
around so it would be backwards so you
put<00:05:10.700> when<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.060> put<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.330> d/s<00:05:11.750> in<00:05:13.090> its<00:05:14.090> like<00:05:14.440> in

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
put when you put the d/s in its like in

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.120 
put when you put the d/s in its like in
it<00:05:15.860> should<00:05:16.100> be<00:05:16.220> like<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.150> have<00:05:18.130> the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
it should be like this and have the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.219 
it should be like this and have the
power<00:05:19.370> bar<00:05:19.669> power<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.900> thing<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:21.590> the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
power bar power and the thing and the

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:30.360 
power bar power and the thing and the
power<00:05:24.229> and<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.590> where<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:29.080> pen<00:05:30.080> are

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
power and the where the the the pen are

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.710 
power and the where the the the pen are
facing<00:05:31.370> out<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:32.180> would<00:05:32.330> have<00:05:32.419> been<00:05:32.510> much

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
facing out it would have been much

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.860 
facing out it would have been much
better<00:05:33.460> then<00:05:34.460> but<00:05:35.090> you'd<00:05:35.240> still<00:05:35.300> have<00:05:35.540> this

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
better then but you'd still have this

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.080 
better then but you'd still have this
cord<00:05:36.440> sticking<00:05:36.830> out<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.070> side<00:05:37.220> so<00:05:37.910> they

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
cord sticking out the side so they

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.320 
cord sticking out the side so they
should<00:05:38.300> have<00:05:38.390> put<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:38.660> cord<00:05:39.050> at<00:05:39.350> the<00:05:39.530> BOK<00:05:39.740> s

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
should have put the cord at the BOK s

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.659 
should have put the cord at the BOK s
right<00:05:41.330> at<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.660> back<00:05:41.840> put<00:05:42.290> the<00:05:42.530> logo<00:05:43.310> at<00:05:43.640> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
right at the back put the logo at the

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.170 
right at the back put the logo at the
front<00:05:44.260> what<00:05:45.260> it<00:05:45.350> looked<00:05:45.500> cooler<00:05:45.830> well<00:05:46.580> would

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
front what it looked cooler well would

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.100
