00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
of damage from just that computer

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.919 
of damage from just that computer
exploding<00:01:55.030> okay<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.239> we're<00:01:56.450> gonna<00:01:56.569> make<00:01:56.780> our

that there's no one be yeah there is big

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.569 
that there's no one be yeah there is big
no-no<00:02:59.129> in<00:02:59.519> this<00:02:59.849> math<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.359> um<00:03:01.489> trying<00:03:02.489> to

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
no-no in this math is um trying to

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.429 
no-no in this math is um trying to
disarm<00:03:02.879> a<00:03:03.060> bomb<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.719> taking<00:03:04.049> care<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.290> all

because if you're trying to disarm they
start<00:03:08.249> shooting<00:03:08.430> at<00:03:08.669> you're<00:03:08.879> they're<00:03:09.030> just

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
start shooting at you're they're just

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
hostage escape because that's ones that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.580 
hostage escape because that's ones that
I'd<00:04:11.030> count<00:04:11.270> toward<00:04:11.540> their<00:04:11.690> objective<00:04:12.110> and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
I'd count toward their objective and

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.960 
I'd count toward their objective and
that's<00:04:12.860> basically<00:04:13.250> when<00:04:13.610> they<00:04:13.730> make<00:04:13.940> it

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
that's basically when they make it

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.570 
that's basically when they make it
outside<00:04:15.489> now<00:04:16.489> about<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:17.000> last<00:04:17.330> bomb<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:18.580> think

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
outside now about that last bomb I think

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.100 
outside now about that last bomb I think
that<00:04:19.700> should<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.330> hostages<00:04:20.810> I'm

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
that should be it for the hostages I'm

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.490 
that should be it for the hostages I'm
pretty<00:04:21.320> sure<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:21.590> only<00:04:21.709> need<00:04:21.920> four<00:04:26.350> yeah<00:04:27.350> it's

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
pretty sure you only need four yeah it's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.470 
pretty sure you only need four yeah it's
up<00:04:27.590> here<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:28.880> there's<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> hostage<00:04:29.570> escape<00:04:29.990> and

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
up here so there's a hostage escape and

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.900 
up here so there's a hostage escape and
that<00:04:32.800> last<00:04:33.800> one<00:04:33.950> should<00:04:34.250> be<00:04:34.370> making<00:04:34.670> his<00:04:34.760> way

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
that last one should be making his way

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.660 
that last one should be making his way
out<00:04:34.940> pretty<00:04:35.270> soon<00:04:35.540> here<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:37.010> what<00:04:37.160> he<00:04:37.280> does<00:04:37.430> we

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
out pretty soon here and what he does we

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.330 
out pretty soon here and what he does we
should<00:04:37.850> get<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.150> mission<00:04:38.690> complete

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
should get the mission complete

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.300 
should get the mission complete
yeah<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.970> there's<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.420> completed

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
yeah so there's a completed

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.980

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
that's everything that's all we need to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.179 
that's everything that's all we need to
do<00:05:30.889> for<00:05:31.069> this<00:05:31.129> level<00:05:32.469> so<00:05:33.469> all<00:05:33.500> we<00:05:33.860> need<00:05:33.949> to<00:05:34.009> do

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
do for this level so all we need to do

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.649 
do for this level so all we need to do
at<00:05:34.310> this<00:05:34.400> point<00:05:34.610> now<00:05:34.819> is<00:05:35.029> make<00:05:35.240> our<00:05:35.360> way<00:05:35.449> back

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
at this point now is make our way back

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.860 
at this point now is make our way back
out<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.669> sort<00:05:37.669> of<00:05:37.789> oak<00:05:38.060> thing<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.509> I<00:05:38.569> think

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
out to the sort of oak thing and I think

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.679 
out to the sort of oak thing and I think
I<00:05:39.139> think<00:05:39.979> it's<00:05:40.099> this<00:05:40.219> way<00:05:40.430> no<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.240> not<00:05:41.389> it's

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:41.689 
I think it's this way no it's not it's

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.350 
I think it's this way no it's not it's
the<00:05:41.779> wrong<00:05:41.930> way<00:05:44.469> so<00:05:45.469> yeah<00:05:45.620> this<00:05:46.159> um<00:05:46.460> this<00:05:47.029> level

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
the wrong way so yeah this um this level

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.450 
the wrong way so yeah this um this level
is<00:05:47.419> pretty<00:05:47.539> straightforward

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
is pretty straightforward

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.860 
is pretty straightforward
not<00:05:50.460> too<00:05:50.610> much<00:05:50.700> challenge<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.450> it's<00:05:51.690> not

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
not too much challenge it's it's not

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.790 
not too much challenge it's it's not
