and on e4 t6 with and m-52 tu you're
going<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.099> have<00:00:30.279> both<00:00:30.689> exhaust<00:00:31.689> and<00:00:31.930> intake

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going to have both exhaust and intake

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.260 
going to have both exhaust and intake
vanos<00:00:33.430> units<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:35.010> they're<00:00:36.060> controlled<00:00:37.060> by

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
vanos units and they're controlled by

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.140 
vanos units and they're controlled by
oil<00:00:37.870> pressure<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.730> these<00:00:39.730> are<00:00:39.880> the<00:00:39.970> two

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
oil pressure and these are the two

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.000 
oil pressure and these are the two
solenoids<00:00:40.390> is<00:00:40.810> one<00:00:40.960> down<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.320> bottom<00:00:41.650> that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
solenoids is one down the bottom that

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.460 
solenoids is one down the bottom that
one's<00:00:42.190> actually<00:00:42.340> been<00:00:42.670> replaced<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.260> one

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
one's actually been replaced this one

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.040 
one's actually been replaced this one
here<00:00:44.680> has<00:00:44.770> not<00:00:44.920> been<00:00:44.980> replaced<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.870> was

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
here has not been replaced this was

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.360 
here has not been replaced this was
replaced<00:00:47.290> because<00:00:47.530> there's<00:00:47.950> some<00:00:48.130> timing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
replaced because there's some timing

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.180 
replaced because there's some timing
issues<00:00:48.610> on<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.180> engine<00:00:50.100> eventually<00:00:51.100> I'm

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
issues on this engine eventually I'm

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.030 
issues on this engine eventually I'm
going<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.370> be<00:00:51.520> working<00:00:51.850> my<00:00:52.000> way<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:53.040> pulling

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
going to be working my way to pulling

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.830 
going to be working my way to pulling
the<00:00:54.280> cylinder<00:00:54.850> head<00:00:55.000> off<00:00:55.030> but<00:00:55.390> before<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.780> do

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
the cylinder head off but before I do

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.390 
the cylinder head off but before I do
that<00:00:55.960> I'm<00:00:56.200> going<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.380> do<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.530> video<00:00:56.710> on<00:00:56.920> setting

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
that I'm going to do a video on setting

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.760 
that I'm going to do a video on setting
the<00:00:57.670> timing<00:00:58.090> but<00:00:59.020> I'm<00:00:59.290> working<00:00:59.620> my<00:00:59.739> way

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
the timing but I'm working my way

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.370 
the timing but I'm working my way
towards<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.489> intake<00:01:01.060> camshaft<00:01:01.570> sensor<00:01:01.810> which

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
towards the intake camshaft sensor which

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.249 
towards the intake camshaft sensor which
is<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.590> common<00:01:03.010> failure<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.579> these<00:01:03.760> vehicles<00:01:04.259> so

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
is a common failure on these vehicles so

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.499 
is a common failure on these vehicles so
I<00:01:05.530> just<00:01:05.770> want<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.070> go<00:01:06.189> over<00:01:06.520> first<00:01:06.850> removing

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
I just want to go over first removing

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.690 
I just want to go over first removing
the<00:01:07.659> vanos<00:01:08.170> solenoid<00:01:11.190> okay<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.400> vinyl

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
the vanos solenoid okay the vinyl

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.090 
the vanos solenoid okay the vinyl
solenoids<00:01:13.180> right<00:01:13.390> here<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.960> first<00:01:14.260> thing<00:01:14.470> to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
solenoids right here the first thing to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.420 
solenoids right here the first thing to
do<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.520> get<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:16.170> upper<00:01:17.170> line<00:01:17.979> out<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.340> your

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
do is to get this upper line out of your

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.039 
do is to get this upper line out of your
way<00:01:18.550> here<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:19.000> hose<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.450> goes<00:01:19.659> down<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.870> the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
way here this hose that goes down to the

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.740 
way here this hose that goes down to the
cyclone<00:01:20.530> separator<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:22.090> mine<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.570> actually

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
cyclone separator now mine is actually

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.170 
cyclone separator now mine is actually
broken<00:01:23.229> on<00:01:23.470> these<00:01:23.650> two<00:01:23.860> tabs<00:01:24.159> here<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:24.909> have

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
broken on these two tabs here so I have

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.130 
broken on these two tabs here so I have
to<00:01:25.299> replace<00:01:25.540> this<00:01:25.870> wine<00:01:26.110> but<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:28.150> just<00:01:28.540> use<00:01:28.990> it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
to replace this wine but you just use it

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.010 
to replace this wine but you just use it
a<00:01:29.229> 90<00:01:29.560> degree<00:01:29.799> pick<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.310> see<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.450> part<00:01:31.780> here

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
a 90 degree pick and see this part here

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.170 
a 90 degree pick and see this part here
is<00:01:32.110> broken<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:33.130> should<00:01:33.369> be<00:01:33.490> attached<00:01:33.820> there

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
is broken this should be attached there

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.289 
is broken this should be attached there
and<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.630> go<00:01:34.840> on<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.290> inside<00:01:35.650> here<00:01:36.070> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and you go on the inside here and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.490 
and you go on the inside here and
basically<00:01:37.299> you're<00:01:37.570> working<00:01:37.960> these<00:01:38.110> tabs

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
basically you're working these tabs

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.550 
basically you're working these tabs
right<00:01:38.799> here<00:01:38.860> free<00:01:39.430> so<00:01:40.420> basically<00:01:41.380> you're

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
right here free so basically you're

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.230 
right here free so basically you're
going<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:41.710> push<00:01:41.920> them<00:01:42.100> out<00:01:42.250> carefully<00:01:42.700> and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
going to push them out carefully and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.420 
going to push them out carefully and
usually<00:01:44.229> what<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.500> end<00:01:44.619> up<00:01:44.680> doing<00:01:44.979> is<00:01:45.100> kind<00:01:45.310> of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
usually what you end up doing is kind of

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.260 
usually what you end up doing is kind of
you<00:01:45.549> get<00:01:46.090> one<00:01:46.150> side<00:01:46.630> started<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you get one side started like that and

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.170 
you get one side started like that and
then<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:49.840> would<00:01:49.930> come<00:01:50.140> from<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.830> inside<00:01:51.189> do

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
then you would come from the inside do

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.850 
then you would come from the inside do
the<00:01:52.360> same<00:01:52.570> thing<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:53.229> we<00:01:53.380> look<00:01:53.619> free

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
the same thing and then we look free

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.890 
the same thing and then we look free
just<00:01:54.580> be<00:01:54.700> careful<00:01:55.060> if<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.150> pull<00:01:55.390> back<00:01:55.600> too

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
just be careful if you pull back too

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.160 
just be careful if you pull back too
fast<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.220> brittle<00:01:58.060> you'll<00:01:58.630> snap<00:01:58.990> it

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
fast and this is brittle you'll snap it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.200 
fast and this is brittle you'll snap it
right<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.700> goes<00:02:00.909> all<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.090> way

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
right here and that goes all the way

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.780 
right here and that goes all the way
down<00:02:01.479> under<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.930> intake<00:02:02.200> manifold<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.979> it's

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
down under the intake manifold and it's

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.359 
down under the intake manifold and it's
kind<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.180> pain<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.540> do<00:02:04.659> by<00:02:04.869> itself<00:02:05.259> but<00:02:06.070> just

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
kind of a pain to do by itself but just

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.130 
kind of a pain to do by itself but just
with<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.909> little<00:02:07.030> bit<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.330> finesse<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:07.990> get

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
with a little bit of finesse you can get

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.619 
with a little bit of finesse you can get
that<00:02:08.489> hose<00:02:09.489> out<00:02:09.729> if<00:02:09.879> you<00:02:10.000> wait<00:02:10.179> for<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
that hose out if you wait for the

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:16.100 
that hose out if you wait for the
cyclone<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.680> have<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> connector<00:02:12.459> right<00:02:12.609> here

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.460 

and<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.760> very<00:02:19.090> easy<00:02:19.470> connector

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
and this is just a very easy connector

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.280 
and this is just a very easy connector
to<00:02:20.710> disconnect<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.790> has<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.240> push<00:02:22.540> tab<00:02:22.780> spring

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
to disconnect it has a push tab spring

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.320 
to disconnect it has a push tab spring
on<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.590> top<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.100> have<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.820> push<00:02:25.030> down<00:02:25.060> on

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
on the top just have to push down on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330 
on the top just have to push down on
that<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.410> wiggle<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.430> back<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:29.020> get<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.130> to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
that and wiggle it back to get that to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.690 
that and wiggle it back to get that to
come<00:02:30.370> free<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.830> that's<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
come free like that and that's just a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.190 
come free like that and that's just a
two<00:02:33.910> pin<00:02:34.180> power<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.720> ground<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.990> next

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
two pin power and ground so the next

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.640 
two pin power and ground so the next
step<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:40.060> hard<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.510> lot<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.660> times<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.170> get<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.350> a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
step it's hard a lot of times to get a a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.520 
step it's hard a lot of times to get a a
wrench<00:02:42.190> in<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.290> use<00:02:44.470> a

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
wrench in here so I like to just use a

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
wrench in here so I like to just use a
pair<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.890> vise<00:02:45.070> grips<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:53.790> flip<00:02:54.790> them<00:02:54.970> over<00:02:55.120> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
pair of vise grips so flip them over and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.070 
pair of vise grips so flip them over and
just<00:02:56.500> get<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.709> good<00:02:56.950> bite<00:02:57.160> on<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:58.750> where

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
just get a good bite on it right where

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.570 
just get a good bite on it right where
the<00:02:59.770> solenoid<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:02.170> give<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.890> pop<00:03:03.100> down

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
the solenoid is just give it a pop down

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.300 
the solenoid is just give it a pop down
usually<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.480> comes<00:03:04.720> free<00:03:05.850> once<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:07.060> loose

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
usually it comes free once it's loose

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.229 
usually it comes free once it's loose
they<00:03:09.310> unscrew<00:03:09.820> pretty<00:03:10.150> easily<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.959> most<00:03:11.500> cases

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
they unscrew pretty easily in most cases

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.250 
they unscrew pretty easily in most cases
take<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.300> shop<00:03:13.989> towel<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:15.780> put<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.959> underneath

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
take a shop towel and put it underneath

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.949 
take a shop towel and put it underneath
there's<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.310> lot<00:03:18.489> of<00:03:18.610> times<00:03:18.880> you'll<00:03:19.120> look<00:03:19.330> lose

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
there's a lot of times you'll look lose

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.920 
there's a lot of times you'll look lose
some<00:03:20.200> oil<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.209> I'm<00:03:22.269> going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.480> go<00:03:22.600> ahead<00:03:22.690> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
some oil so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.390 
some oil so I'm going to go ahead and
spin<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.320> solenoid<00:03:23.830> off

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.420 

this<00:03:32.400> would<00:03:32.640> also<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.120> first<00:03:33.270> step<00:03:34.430> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
this would also be the first step to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.920 
this would also be the first step to
access<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.980> intake<00:03:38.490> camshaft<00:03:39.000> sensor<00:03:39.180> so

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
access the intake camshaft sensor so

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.920 
access the intake camshaft sensor so
this<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> solenoid<00:03:40.860> right<00:03:41.040> here<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:42.690> just

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
this is the solenoid right here it just

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.840 
this is the solenoid right here it just
has<00:03:43.170> an<00:03:43.350> o-ring<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.820> is

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
has an o-ring on it so that it is

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.410 
has an o-ring on it so that it is
replaceable<00:03:45.420> if<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.600> had<00:03:45.720> an<00:03:45.840> oil<00:03:46.020> leak<00:03:46.370> these

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
replaceable if you had an oil leak these

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.320 
replaceable if you had an oil leak these
rarely<00:03:48.420> go<00:03:48.630> bad<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.170> if<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.670> have<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.850> problem

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
rarely go bad and if you have a problem

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.540 
rarely go bad and if you have a problem
with<00:03:51.480> your<00:03:51.600> vanos<00:03:51.960> unit<00:03:51.990> they<00:03:52.860> come<00:03:53.130> with<00:03:53.310> new

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
with your vanos unit they come with new

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.520 
with your vanos unit they come with new
solenoids<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.490> have<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:57.530> camshaft

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
solenoids so if you have a camshaft

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.940 
solenoids so if you have a camshaft
sensor<00:03:59.490> fault<00:04:00.170> or<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.230> camshaft<00:04:01.530> position

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
sensor fault or a camshaft position

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.430 
sensor fault or a camshaft position
fault<00:04:02.580> a<00:04:02.850> lot<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.450> times<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.960> actually

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
fault a lot of times it's actually

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.410 
fault a lot of times it's actually
either<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.860> intake<00:04:05.220> or<00:04:05.400> exhaust<00:04:05.430> sensors<00:04:06.180> and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
either the intake or exhaust sensors and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.700 
either the intake or exhaust sensors and
not<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.260> solenoid<00:04:08.990> if<00:04:09.990> you<00:04:10.140> do<00:04:10.320> decide<00:04:10.650> to

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
not the solenoid if you do decide to

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.370 
not the solenoid if you do decide to
replace<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.400> they<00:04:11.790> are<00:04:11.940> pretty<00:04:12.210> easy<00:04:12.480> again

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
replace it they are pretty easy again

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.860 
replace it they are pretty easy again
once<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.160> one's<00:04:14.400> off<00:04:14.720> installation<00:04:15.720> would

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
once this one's off installation would

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.080 
once this one's off installation would
be<00:04:16.080> put<00:04:16.710> a<00:04:16.739> little<00:04:16.950> bit<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.190> oil<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:17.550> that<00:04:17.610> seal

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
be put a little bit of oil on that seal

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:28.490 
be put a little bit of oil on that seal
and<00:04:19.340> basically<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.640> screw<00:04:20.850> in<00:04:20.940> back<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:27.500> put

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and basically just screw in back in put

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.540 
and basically just screw in back in put
there<00:04:28.680> snug<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.970> doesn't<00:04:30.330> take<00:04:30.480> much<00:04:31.550> to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
there snug and it doesn't take much to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:40.640 
there snug and it doesn't take much to
tighten<00:04:32.910> these<00:04:33.030> up<00:04:36.170> done<00:04:39.440> reconnect<00:04:40.440> the

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
tighten these up done reconnect the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.690 
tighten these up done reconnect the
electrical<00:04:41.160> connector<00:04:45.200> and<00:04:46.200> then<00:04:46.700> hopefully
