00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.930
 hi girls, guys, I do not already tell you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.809
 not that anime is not any kind of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.910
 makeup made me a river and a producer 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.320
 and nothing of the sure style that many of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.990
 you already know what it is for the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 that do not encourage fundamentally are the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.739
 typical Japanese drawings not like you can 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 be dragon ball pokemon heidi and good 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.819
 the cheeses sure you know 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.800
 I also love anime and it's one of my 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.390
 passions then always have a little 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 of doubts with this video because always 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.840
 I wanted to do it or something 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.450
 related to anime with manga 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 but I do not know to what extent 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.100
 you my subscribers like it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.650
 also this world but I have tried 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.090
 always pass my videos on making a 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.270
 content that I would like to see 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.160
 then I do to an emmy bloggers 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.380
 youtubers favorites a make-up I see 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
 what about an anime video 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.210
 I would die of love and go to see him at 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.280
 instantly so it can be deserved 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.860
 do it who knows maybe more than one 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.510
 Following this video, start watching anime 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.390
 then to begin he decided to make a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.070
 selection of five animes that do not have 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 relationship are not of the same gender nor 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.240
 much less but there are five animes I 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.570
 I have seen over the past years 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.490
 more and more recent older and good 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.440
 I have also loved it and that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.200
 I would recommend to everyone 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.280
 we started the first one that I recommend is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.110
 vampyr light vampire knight is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 unanimously I am I is to say one more cloud 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 indicated for the female audience of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.830
 girls and the plot is basically a girl 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.020
 like vampire I will not let you see if you 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.780
 like there is not a fantastic 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.090
 great my last vampires my relationship 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 like to see a series are two 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.420
 seasons of 13 episodes each of 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.369
 20 minutes each and it's great it 's very 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.189
 tender or very sweet or very loving and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 hook the second that I recommend are or 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.009
 totally different one from the genre gore 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.299
 that is a lot of blood many views 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.519
 many strong scenes are worth and it's another 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.069
 is unanimous super short of 12 episodes 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:15.709
 that is about a curse in a 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.720
 town or a school and it's very kind 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.730
 final destination are 12 episodes that you 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.180
 keep in tension from the first and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.660
 until the last one is not really resolved 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.060
 the plot hooked bailong and if you 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.099
 as I like blood and other os 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 I love it, although I recommend you 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.640
 Do not do as I do today, do not see it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.530
 all some night because it is not scary 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.910
 but it does leave you in the bad body and 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.470
 then at least not 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.610
 I have no idea how much 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.320
 animals I have seen throughout my 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.720
 life but yes I know that when he has 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.210
 I really liked the snow'll take 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.390
 the names of the protagonists yes that 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.820
 I remember and from another I know they are 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 sakakibara and my here so another me 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.020
 has loved the third one I recommend and 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.580
 I believe x candy anime favorite is 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.080
 shy glasses 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.180
 this truth I are one and a half 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.440
 two and I'm surprised that I liked it 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.970
 because the detective novel type without 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.070
 detectives and such and that does not usually 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.410
 like because I'm bored with the truth 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.510
 It usually bores me but is unanimous 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.290
 I think it's 22 or 23 episodes 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.060
 I also love shortie I love 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.250
 Characterization of the characters 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.210
 story the plot also a little bit of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.670
 blood is unanimous gross an anime is made 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.600
 that has shocking scenes can 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.840
 lie there is a small part for its 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.460
 part murders I also love if 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.390
 is what took passes I was encouraged 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.580
 of the whole story 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.050
 the fourth I will recommend is your kit 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.200
 May that is that I am from experience or 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.730
 for me, it's the classic, I'm the one 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.910
 shameful girl who does not talk to anyone 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.120
 that the inka has low self-esteem 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.280
 tactical popular I do not know if it's a bit 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.000
 topic would not be anime not like that 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.950
 schoolboy and such and I want him not me 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.840
 he wants I do not like he did not like me 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.450
 They usually attract attention but this one 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.700
 loved are only 12 or 13 episodes 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.739
 They are very few but I do not know what 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.489
 they reach the heart the truth simply 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.590
 already the name is removed inÃ¡cio means 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.690
 tell me you love me or tell me I love you 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.710
 attention I do not know Japanese so more or 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.720
 less so I love it is precious is the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.030
 typical series any girl's 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.810
 popcorn forecasts and if we do not stop 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.810
 until finished 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810
 to me 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.480
 who usually tend to me 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.419
 but he lives it like in all you drive you give 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.979
 account that certain fashions and animes that 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.810
 they end up becoming a little 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.910
 mainstream because everyone sees them 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.600
 even if you do not like the world is here 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.300
 then one of these super series is worth 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.740
 famous was sing equinoxio gym and despite 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.850
 that I did not want to get into this 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.789
 my ranking no typical anime this 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.289
 I think he deserves it, so here 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.900
 it follows that I wanted to mean the attack 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.190
 the titans and is brutal brutal unanimous 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.020
 at first I refused to see it 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.490
 precisely because of that, not because I saw 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.660
 on all the pages that a whole 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.889
 musician and they have that today wow high and 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.380
 denied a bit of seeing it but when 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.840
 vi is 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:29.050
 amazing the drawing is very different 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.320
 but very polished the story is great 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.470
 it's kind of better between medieval and futuristic 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.750
 worth a mankind titans 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.280
 they are good monsters you have to 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.680
 see it to understand it because it is 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.720
 unanimously that from the minute 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.060
 alomejor 15 the first episode already says 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.970
 it's what I want to see whole is very good 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.320
 there is also blood I love blood of 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.850
 fact is so good that I had some 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.520
 friends who do cosplay and who are 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.440
 fantastic in everything their own and they are going to 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.540
 do a casting and group now in July 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.820
 and they asked me to do inco explained 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.280
 new characters and I accepted and now at 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.930
 finally not because you can not go with them 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.270
 but so you can see that I've never 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.760
 done cosplay but the power and of a 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.920
 character of this anime a trip to 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.450
 a lot of hope and that's how I think that 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.500
 it would be my last recommendation do not 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.500
 it came in that anime you recommend 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.639
 hello, girls, I hope you have 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.259
 liked my anime ranking that is not 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.509
 that the last one you have recommended will be the 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.759
 number one nor the first the last nor 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.639
 much less between 2005 anime is that to me 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.009
 I love that I love seeing him again 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.680
 so do not take me completely now 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:44.659
 my little one we are going to play is we send the 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.659
 two a huge kiss swallow
