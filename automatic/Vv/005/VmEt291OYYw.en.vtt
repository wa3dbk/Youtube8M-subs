00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I get a lot of comments and people

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.700 
I get a lot of comments and people
asking<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> diagnose<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.110> misfire

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
asking about how to diagnose a misfire

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.190 
asking about how to diagnose a misfire
one<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.670> key<00:00:06.029> things<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.540> diagnosing<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
one of the key things to diagnosing a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.350 
one of the key things to diagnosing a
misfire<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.309> annoyed<00:00:08.580> light<00:00:08.820> test<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
misfire is to do annoyed light test on a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.749 
misfire is to do annoyed light test on a
fuel-injected<00:00:09.990> car<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.130> annoyed<00:00:11.429> light

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
fuel-injected car this is annoyed light

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.490 
fuel-injected car this is annoyed light
it's<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:13.099> GM<00:00:14.120> port<00:00:15.120> fuel<00:00:15.330> injection<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.260> GM

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it's for GM port fuel injection or GM

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460 
it's for GM port fuel injection or GM
PFI<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.180> basically<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.320> with

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
PFI and so basically what you do with

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.130 
PFI and so basically what you do with
this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:19.980> unplug<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> injector<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
this is you unplug the injector this is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.960 
this is you unplug the injector this is
a<00:00:22.170> chrysler<00:00:22.890> pacifica<00:00:23.960> 3.5<00:00:24.960> liter<00:00:25.230> 2006<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
a chrysler pacifica 3.5 liter 2006 you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.730 
a chrysler pacifica 3.5 liter 2006 you
look<00:00:27.150> at<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> plug<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.260> plugs<00:00:28.470> in

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
look at the plug and this just plugs in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.019 
look at the plug and this just plugs in
there<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> positive<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
there so you got a positive in the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.950 
there so you got a positive in the
ground<00:00:30.500> go<00:00:31.500> ahead<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.800> crank<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.279> tyson

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.229 

hold<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.640> didn't<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.210> good

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
hold on I didn't get it in there good

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.150 
hold on I didn't get it in there good
apparently<00:00:40.370> stuck<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> wrong<00:00:41.760> hole

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
apparently stuck it in the wrong hole

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.080 
apparently stuck it in the wrong hole
didn't<00:00:44.160> even<00:00:44.250> fuss<00:00:44.579> alright<00:00:45.059> go<00:00:45.210> ahead

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.110 

that's<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.040> we<00:00:53.190> saw<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.970> we

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that's good so what we saw there is we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.750 
that's good so what we saw there is we
saw<00:00:54.330> bright<00:00:54.750> flashes<00:00:55.380> at<00:00:55.560> first<00:00:55.950> for<00:00:56.250> starting

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
saw bright flashes at first for starting

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
saw bright flashes at first for starting
and<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.060> more<00:00:57.270> fuel<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.840> then<00:00:58.050> after<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.560> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and get more fuel and then after that a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.310 
and get more fuel and then after that a
quick<00:00:59.520> pull<00:00:59.820> sort<00:01:00.150> of<00:01:00.210> short<00:01:00.450> pulse<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.110> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
quick pull sort of short pulse this is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.130 
quick pull sort of short pulse this is
an<00:01:01.440> incandescent<00:01:01.890> bulb<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.700> it<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:04.020> know<00:01:04.110> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
an incandescent bulb in it you know just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.620 
an incandescent bulb in it you know just
tungsten<00:01:04.710> filament<00:01:05.160> so<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> does<00:01:06.300> is<00:01:06.480> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
tungsten filament so what it does is it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.330 
tungsten filament so what it does is it
kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.870> gives<00:01:07.050> you<00:01:07.140> an<00:01:07.230> idea<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:08.220> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
kind of gives you an idea of what your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
kind of gives you an idea of what your
pulse<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.480> a<00:01:09.570> long<00:01:09.810> pole<00:01:10.170> short

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
pulse is like if it's a long pole short

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.570 
pulse is like if it's a long pole short
pulse<00:01:10.980> and<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.360> real<00:01:12.540> damn<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.050> not<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
pulse and if it's real damn or not so we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
pulse and if it's real damn or not so we
know<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.480> getting<00:01:15.750> signal<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.680> had

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
know that it's getting signal and we had

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.640 
know that it's getting signal and we had
a<00:01:16.860> code<00:01:17.130> p0<00:01:17.610> 206<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.870> means<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.560> have

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
a code p0 206 which means that we have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.220 
a code p0 206 which means that we have
an<00:01:19.770> open<00:01:19.890> circuit<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> cylinder<00:01:21.240> six<00:01:21.600> injector

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
an open circuit on cylinder six injector

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.600 
an open circuit on cylinder six injector
so<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.940> not<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.540> cars<00:01:25.080> issue<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.160> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
so it's not the cars issue it's not the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
so it's not the cars issue it's not the
from<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.910> wire<00:01:27.090> harness<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.690> fine

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
from the wire harness we're fine

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.730 
from the wire harness we're fine
so<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.190> not<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
so if it's not this and then we know the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
so if it's not this and then we know the
injectors<00:01:32.220> map<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.150> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.510> be

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
injectors map so we're going to be

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
injectors map so we're going to be
replacing<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> fuel<00:01:34.380> injector<00:01:34.800> on<00:01:34.950> this

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
replacing the fuel injector on this

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.690 
replacing the fuel injector on this
Lahoma<00:01:35.550> Joma<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.810> C<00:01:37.080> star<00:01:37.440> so<00:01:38.340> anyway

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
Lahoma Joma for my C star so anyway

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.390 
Lahoma Joma for my C star so anyway
that's<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.600> perform<00:01:39.930> enoyed<00:01:40.740> light<00:01:41.040> test

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that's how you perform enoyed light test

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.780 
that's how you perform enoyed light test
to<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.300> injector<00:01:43.110> pulse<00:01:43.790> you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to see if you have injector pulse you

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
to see if you have injector pulse you
know<00:01:44.910> as<00:01:45.030> far<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> individual<00:01:46.020> injector

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
know as far as the individual injector

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.650 
know as far as the individual injector
goes<00:01:46.860> those<00:01:47.550> things<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.330> do<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
goes those things that you can do you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.469 
goes those things that you can do you
can<00:01:48.810> use<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> stethoscope<00:01:49.790> with<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> needle<00:01:51.300> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can use a stethoscope with a needle on

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.390 
can use a stethoscope with a needle on
it<00:01:51.840> instead<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.440> pad<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.979> listening<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
it instead of a pad for listening to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.260 
it instead of a pad for listening to
your<00:01:53.520> heart<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.150> I<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:55.830> hope<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.640> video<00:01:57.060> is
