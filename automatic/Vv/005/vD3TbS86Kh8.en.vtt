know this was a period where you had two
great<00:01:24.240> British<00:01:24.539> engineering<00:01:24.959> companies

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
great British engineering companies

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.449 
great British engineering companies
coming<00:01:25.619> together<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.159> winning<00:01:26.399> a

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.930 

their<00:01:34.110> Cosworth<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.680> drivable<00:01:35.370> very

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
their Cosworth very drivable very

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.810 
their Cosworth very drivable very
flexible<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.870> driver<00:01:37.410> quite<00:01:38.370> clearly<00:01:38.610> at

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
flexible for the driver quite clearly at

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.460 
flexible for the driver quite clearly at
the<00:01:38.940> time<00:01:39.120> that<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.570> cutting<00:01:39.990> edge

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.109 

let's<00:01:45.470> say<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.070> early<00:01:46.549> stages<00:01:46.820> of<00:01:46.970> the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
let's say in the early stages of the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.969 
let's say in the early stages of the
karabiner<00:01:47.540> dynamically<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.890> think

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
karabiner dynamically so I think

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.140 
karabiner dynamically so I think
mechanically<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.700> cars<00:01:49.880> were<00:01:50.060> already

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
mechanically the cars were already

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.520 
mechanically the cars were already
similar<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.720> all<00:01:50.780> we<00:01:50.900> have<00:01:51.049> today

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530
