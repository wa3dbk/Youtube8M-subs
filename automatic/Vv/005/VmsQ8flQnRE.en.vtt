get down oh oh that actually made it

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:35.440 
get down oh oh that actually made it
worse

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
worse

worse
nevermind<00:03:36.290> no<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.830> was<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.010> fish<00:03:37.160> for<00:03:37.340> lab

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
nevermind no that was the fish for lab

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.990 
nevermind no that was the fish for lab
it's<00:03:37.819> gross<00:03:38.180> man<00:03:38.599> yeah<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.379> was<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.530> bad<00:03:39.739> idea<00:03:40.000> it

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
it's gross man yeah it was a bad idea it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.220 
it's gross man yeah it was a bad idea it
was<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.180> really<00:03:41.360> bad<00:03:41.599> idea

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
was a really bad idea

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.890 
was a really bad idea
he's<00:03:42.530> my<00:03:42.709> coke<00:03:43.010> yeah<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:44.060> don't<00:03:44.480> know<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
he's my coke yeah I don't know it

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.970 
he's my coke yeah I don't know it
probably<00:03:45.230> would<00:03:45.349> have<00:03:45.410> been<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.590> little<00:03:45.739> bit

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
probably would have been a little bit

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.979 
probably would have been a little bit
better<00:03:46.099> with<00:03:46.340> more<00:03:46.549> like<00:03:46.790> liquid<00:03:47.209> but<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.690> don't

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
better with more like liquid but I don't

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.089 
better with more like liquid but I don't
know<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:48.200> don't<00:03:48.470> like<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.680> fact<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:48.950> I

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
know I just don't like the fact that I

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.800 
know I just don't like the fact that I
yeah<00:03:49.250> II<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.849> use<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.060> spoon

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
yeah II to use a spoon

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.039 
yeah II to use a spoon
yeah<00:03:50.930> it's<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.470> worst<00:03:51.650> part<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:52.519> like

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
yeah it's the worst part it's just like

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.289 
yeah it's the worst part it's just like
my<00:03:54.049> theory<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.500> if<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.459> drink<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.730> fast<00:03:56.120> enough

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
my theory is if I drink this fast enough

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.780 
my theory is if I drink this fast enough
it'll<00:03:57.079> just<00:03:57.349> go<00:03:57.709> past<00:03:58.010> my<00:03:58.310> tongue<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.700> it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
it'll just go past my tongue and it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.339 
it'll just go past my tongue and it
won't<00:03:58.940> taste<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.299> as<00:03:59.360> much<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.810> then<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.200> can

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
won't taste it as much and then I can

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.410 
won't taste it as much and then I can
immediately<00:04:00.730> after<00:04:01.730> consuming<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.239> large

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
immediately after consuming a large

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.420 
immediately after consuming a large
quantity<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:03.829> have<00:04:03.980> some<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.220> that

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
quantity of it just have some of that

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:22.650 
quantity of it just have some of that
which<00:04:04.670> has<00:04:04.790> lots<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.150> lime<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:12.680> go

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.320 

night-night<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:24.560> trained<00:04:25.010> with<00:04:25.039> a<00:04:25.220> spoon<00:04:25.460> just

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
night-night I trained with a spoon just
