00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.459
 for those who like to cook 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.370
 the kitchen most important part of the house 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.430
 and I'm in a now very modern but 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.040
 with an all rustic touch that's design 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
 interior design in your area has 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.330
 here in this space she speaks a little 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.320
 What did you think about when designing? 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.379
 this kitchen is first made a brief right 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 and the customer requested that he 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.870
 where she could sit 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
 in the morning having coffee then I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.820
 I thought about working with what is a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.120
 wood- lined flooring with 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.519
 time and this proposal came 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.850
 also on the wall, but in this case I 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.210
 used the eco resort and cinnamon is that is a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.809
 porcelain tile and I used it on the floor 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.999
 the wall and the ceiling and reached this 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.010
 I sing here the house that is the song well 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.439
 especially where I also put a tv 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.110
 put niche also worked with 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 chairs that is an iron chair 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.860
 industry and she has made a total 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.790
 here along with the decorating project 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 where various spaces have been modified 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.009
 We did a very good renovation. 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.409
 strong point was this coffee corner 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.719
 that she always wanted to have a corner that she 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.469
 get up in the morning to work sitting in the 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.930
 your coffee 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.780
 the material we use also the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 furniture or rope material that is a 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.810
 mdf coating with this trend 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.509
 I also worked rock stone on the workbench 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.729
 and in the sliding door that the partition 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.719
 between the kitchen and the service area 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.460
 I worked the linen cloth nÃ© with glass and 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.119
 I did the type a sandwich job 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.509
 and a very large differential and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.210
 so it's a small kitchen and gave 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.969
 adapt all these furniture furniture 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 what you wanted here in the environment without 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.640
 that it would lose circulation if it 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.370
 actually we did a work 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.519
 measurement very carefully and the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.680
 main was the bench where I 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.040
 I worked a bench 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.640
 dries a wet bench and a blow 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.379
 then it was dried and passed one space 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.659
 and I think she was well satisfied 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.790
 as if you made the choice of the ornaments 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.890
 the kitchen because it is not so 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.579
 simple though it is a thing without 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 Food Fruit Crystals is that choice to 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.849
 people will also follow the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680
 briefing what the customer likes the colors 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.010
 I've worked with some materials that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.750
 are a handmade arts and crafts are 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.769

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.080
 fundamental in highlighting and life

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.140
 outstanding well sabella but also 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.960
 that illumination that you do not see 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.970

 environment of the differential ac is the 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.470
 uranium or even right 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.810
