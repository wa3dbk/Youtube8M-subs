00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.900 

now<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.740> proof<00:03:38.980> does<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.610> fit<00:03:44.700> perfect<00:03:45.760> look

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
now the proof does it fit perfect look

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.110 
now the proof does it fit perfect look
at<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.470> gonna<00:03:47.470> tie<00:03:48.250> downs<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:48.700> it'll<00:03:48.880> be<00:03:49.000> all
