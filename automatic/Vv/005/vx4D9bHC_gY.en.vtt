00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.910
 such a big role in a green oasis of grass the name following films would thereby 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.319
 help out 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 start digging the existing soil about twenty centimeters deep 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.769
 for example, before the old turf was trenched or removed so that the 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.550
 clean soil comes on top 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.069
 compacting the soil with a tire 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.640
 on the street this sturdy 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.460
 now the leveling can begin 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.460
 use a hook for the first coarse leveling 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.180
 Then cover the surface tightly with a plank so that any bumps and 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.580
 pits disappear into the soil 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.550
 make sure that the height of the press is not even two centimeters lower than 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.620
 the court states 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.610
 This is easy to check the dog shelves flat on the bottom next to it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.610
 terrace to lay the curb 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.970
 the subsurface structures through a light fine egelization 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.670
 you do this through the bottom about 2 centimeters deep 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.610
 lies on business 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.710
 possibly with extra and pk and fertilizer added food 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.480
 for a quick rooting of the sod 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 now one can start laying the turf 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 Always start in a right corner of the gardens and make sure that there is the right 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 connecting to the terraces on the curb 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.320
 scarce the turf close to each other with the board so that it is nice and tight 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.320
 come to lie 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.680
 cut the turf to length with a knife or spades 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.439
 and turns left over pieces to explain why in the following 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.400
 Keep this order of giving consistent 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.190
 holden turf barack obama and put them in half band 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 same principle as a brick wall 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.549
 make sure that the grass side fits well together 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.309
 or on the turf with the school desks 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.519
 start spraying the soles immediately 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.689
 due to this a few days plentiful and then regularly 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.519
 want to know if you have sprayed enough 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.269
 much better than the turf 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.209
 to see if the surface is well wet 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.760
 checks it regularly until the turf is solid ground 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.859
 we wish you a lot of dirty pleasure
