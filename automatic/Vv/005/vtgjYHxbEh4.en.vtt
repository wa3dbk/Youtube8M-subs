00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.490
 why 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.830
 had to celebrate in style the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.960
 20 years of cooked radicle and for 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.330
 occasion until the weather accompanied 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.220
 the sections were quite broken and the 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.720
 porch skated but finally they were going to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.610
 see was the victory behind the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 mechanical problems suffered by Alberto 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.880
 meira 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.270
 tomorrow we went out a bit thinking about catching 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.400
 rhythm little by little and take us a little 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.290
 unsuspecting and puts us today to a good 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.550
 attacked but good soon we react 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.860
 we thought that today the lack of 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.420
 training with candid in this case 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.309
 but you can tell he's a co-pilot 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.330
 that has many tables that comes from the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.280
 world championship they are 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.200
 accustomed there with little past and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 an election of a runner-up of Spain 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.280
 how is alberto meira 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.729
 besides the mechanics due to a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.710
 personal problem of david vázquez meira 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.540
 arrived co-piloted by candid race 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 that he was suffering because he could not 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 train and go with the notes of vázquez 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.659
 despite all the r4 saw it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.460
 everything they were able to fight from one to the other 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.330
 against the porsche and they even came to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.910
 be free 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.530
 what you have suffered in this rally 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.410
 problems in the rubber address in the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.750
 gasoline pump copy new a merit 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.220
 after all the problems that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.890
 we had with the gas pump 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.050
 we lost a lot of time already yesterday but I think 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.260
 that especially ride in the car without 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.150
 have gone through the sections without is has 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.070
 a great merit on the part of candid no 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.010
 it's not easy to go to the stage not with the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 other notes 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.300
 a little complicated but good Alberto 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.580
 truth is that it helped me a lot because in 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.320
 all day he gave me super quiet and I 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.630
 I felt like 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.310
 Alberto but it seemed he could complete 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.020
 the podium and even fight for the position 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 of silver but finally a problem 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.770
 mechanic forced him to abandon that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.470
 gave way to javier ramos and his 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.150
 pole to sneak onto the podium better 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.430
 impossible I do not know if this result you 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.790
 you were waiting like all the pilot because you 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 like to compete at home and well then this 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.390
 year we did it and a little bit what 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.240
 main was to start the rally finish it 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.830
 that we have achieved and above 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.870
 well I think that with the award of oviedo 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.850
 but undoubtedly one of the protagonists 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.160
 of the day was yago silva who with his 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.870
 c2 r2 managed to get in fourth 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.520
 position ahead of raised 10 of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.100
 Belon who suffered during the entire rally 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.780
 problems with the turbo silva I got 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.840
 also the first place in the top tempir 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.840
 and 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.760
 you have left us without words and words 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.739
 you and without words we if the truth 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.189
 is that it is impressive we are without 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.170
 words both because we started to 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.269
 the morning already surprising us with the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.159
 times the difference of rhythm of notes 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.650
 and everything was but good to get used to 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.659
 ours all day long and such and little 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.790
 to little and we will continue working so that 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.790
 so that every time everything works better 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.390
 at the wheel fg a victory for sergio 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.950
 is beautiful and borja botana great prize 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.349
 for this team that was on the verge of 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.880
 not finally participate in the improvements in 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.980
 the suspensions and the new engine of the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.980
 206 were noticed on the line 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 failed direct rivals but 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.579
 we are accommodating ourselves to the car and the 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.019
 car we say a couple of improvements and now 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.019
 giving correct taste in success 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.819

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.030
 after the problems before the 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.239
 rally that happened with the sax in what 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.250
 A loss of water is quite important 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.960
 well the truth could not be asked anymore 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.419
 after all the week we spent 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.510
 neither was it exaggerated that always 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.350
 people are believed were the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.350
 true that you could cut 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.980
 in the base promotion who won 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840
