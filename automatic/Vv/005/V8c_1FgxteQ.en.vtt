00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
you can see we're still growing back of

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.940 
you can see we're still growing back of
course<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.290> not<00:01:59.380> back<00:01:59.590> one<00:01:59.710> hundred<00:01:59.920> percent

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
course is not back one hundred percent

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.480 
course is not back one hundred percent
but<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.960> looks<00:02:02.110> like<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.440> know<00:02:02.590> little

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
but it's just looks like you know little

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.820 
but it's just looks like you know little
tiny<00:02:03.640> springs<00:02:03.970> in<00:02:04.119> here<00:02:04.330> it's<00:02:05.320> not<00:02:05.470> as<00:02:05.619> bad<00:02:05.650> as

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
tiny springs in here it's not as bad as

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.830 
tiny springs in here it's not as bad as
it<00:02:06.010> was<00:02:06.040> though<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:07.270> can<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.659> what<00:02:07.780> my

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
it was though you can just do what my

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.080 
it was though you can just do what my
hairline<00:02:08.140> has<00:02:08.379> to<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.590> back<00:02:08.769> in<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:09.940> glad

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
hairline has to go back in so I'm glad

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.989 
hairline has to go back in so I'm glad
that<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:10.689> hit<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.109> cover<00:02:11.409> it<00:02:11.499> up<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:12.159> feel

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:12.999 
that this hit can cover it up I feel

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:13.670 
that this hit can cover it up I feel
across

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
across

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.780 
across

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
can see this is just a little little

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
can see this is just a little little
Springs<00:02:23.329> but<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:25.349> doesn't<00:02:25.650> look<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.769> bad<00:02:26.099> to

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
Springs but it doesn't look that bad to

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
with it so um but yeah but of course i

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.849 
with it so um but yeah but of course i
can<00:02:45.450> imagine<00:02:45.629> even<00:02:45.959> trying<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> pin<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.680> now

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
can imagine even trying to pin it up now

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.710 
can imagine even trying to pin it up now
my<00:02:47.159> edges<00:02:47.430> looking<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:47.730> way<00:02:47.819> they<00:02:47.939> do<00:02:48.000> unless

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
my edges looking the way they do unless

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470 
my edges looking the way they do unless
I<00:02:48.810> had<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> really<00:02:49.169> fresh<00:02:49.500> retwist<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.120> want

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
I had a really fresh retwist but I want

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.940 
I had a really fresh retwist but I want
to<00:02:51.569> be<00:02:51.659> like<00:02:51.780> maybe<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.049> little<00:02:52.169> pip<00:02:52.439> sounds<00:02:52.859> or

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
stuff like that but I think that'd be

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.750

couple more months and then I might try

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.899 
couple more months and then I might try
something<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.489> my<00:02:59.609> edges

right now so that's it that's definitely
that<00:06:53.190> was<00:06:53.280> definitely<00:06:53.310> off<00:06:53.700> on<00:06:53.850> a<00:06:53.880> tangent<00:06:54.060> so

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
again all the way around I think got

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.470 
again all the way around I think got
that<00:06:58.860> awkward<00:06:59.190> phase<00:06:59.220> if<00:06:59.610> that<00:06:59.760> froze<00:07:00.060> over

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
that awkward phase if that froze over

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.820 
that awkward phase if that froze over
because<00:07:00.690> I<00:07:00.810> hated<00:07:01.110> my<00:07:01.290> hair<00:07:01.470> when<00:07:01.560> it<00:07:01.620> was<00:07:01.710> that

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.530 
because I hated my hair when it was that
short<00:07:02.100> why<00:07:02.550> it<00:07:02.610> was<00:07:02.850> liberating<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.510> be

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
short why it was liberating to be

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.570 
short why it was liberating to be
natural<00:07:03.810> and<00:07:04.080> stuff<00:07:04.320> but<00:07:04.530> I<00:07:04.800> wanted<00:07:05.370> nothing

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
natural and stuff but I wanted nothing

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.070 
natural and stuff but I wanted nothing
more<00:07:05.760> than<00:07:05.970> for<00:07:06.150> my<00:07:06.300> hair<00:07:06.480> to<00:07:06.510> get<00:07:06.750> like<00:07:06.900> this

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
more than for my hair to get like this

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.300 
more than for my hair to get like this
