00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.720 
usually you should use an mp3 format I'm
not<00:00:31.199> sure<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.500> other<00:00:31.650> formats<00:00:32.040> work<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
not sure if other formats work but I

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.940 
not sure if other formats work but I
would<00:00:33.120> stick<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> mp3s<00:00:33.930> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.469> mostly

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
would stick to mp3s if you can mostly

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
would stick to mp3s if you can mostly
most<00:00:35.280> likely<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.670> music<00:00:35.940> will<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.149> mp3s

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

you're<00:01:09.869> gonna<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you're gonna see here that I think the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.230 
you're gonna see here that I think the
first<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
first time I did it right here it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
first time I did it right here it
doesn't<00:01:12.570> work<00:01:12.770> sometimes<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
doesn't work sometimes if you go to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.410 
doesn't work sometimes if you go to
story<00:01:14.520> mode<00:01:14.700> it'll<00:01:14.939> work<00:01:15.090> better<00:01:15.240> because

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
story mode it'll work better because

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.910 
story mode it'll work better because
here<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> still<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.380> self<00:01:16.680> radio

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
