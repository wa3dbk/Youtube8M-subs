 very much to be pregnant late 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.719
 how to take care of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.310
 I learned a lot from the doctor 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 but it was at the dentist who told me things that really apprehended me 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.920

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.800
 the son of ana 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.830
 How good that strong that I found you is very good to be able to talk to someone who 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.560
 she went through all this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.080
 the wake of fact 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.240
 I have a few minutes before I have to go through p 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.079
 First 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.990
 If you have not been to the dentist for the past six months 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.660
 and in this one 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.760
 until now for each patient 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.350
 I was careful so that the cta paraná metal also shaanxi 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.229
 During pregnancy it is important that with medical attention and care 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.690
 scientists 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 because during pregnancy two levels of hormones grow and this is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.150
 more likely to suffer from pregnancy gingivitis 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.910
 what is gingivitis 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.390
 it's when simpler without feeling you can get a disease of the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.249
 gums 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.959

 Gums may have premature birth 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.030
 babies with low birth weight and other problems to avoid these problems 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.470
 you have to remember to brush your teeth two or three times a day using 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 Floss every night rinse your mouth with warm salt water or with a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.180
 Mouthwash that helps prevent the zarco I also learned that a diet 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.410
 complete with food of all groups is very important for my health 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.170
 mental 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.069
 the baby's too 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.310
 the food 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.770
 as dairy products provide castle and vitamin d 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.629
 to strengthen bones and teeth 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.790
 this is essential for the mother and the baby who is growing the loaves and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.790
 cereals have vitamins b 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.940
 for growth I do not want to seem to be lending to this aspect of the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.999
 science 70 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:54.179
 Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and other nutrients 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.389
 important that also help keep the gums healthy 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:04.629
 the lean meat the fish the afternoons and the beans provide iron and 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.229
 ana proteins your teeth look pretty good 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.539
 let me tell you that he made many pregnant women who have cavities 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.969
 caused by eating sugary snacks 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.779
 and do not carry diets 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:18.629
 because 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.780
 you should not drink a lot of soda 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.949
 sugary drinks nor eat so many tourists 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:25.840
 Jorge 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.079
 that really caught my attention 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.799
 has learned a lot with the things that are happening from 200 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:32.620
 as 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.659
 but eat sugary foods between meals if as sugary foods 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.759
 I must do those with meals 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.159
 neither should I eat sticky candy that will stay in my mouth for a long time 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.650
 i of course brushing my teeth and using kilo every day ana 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.909
 Glad you know all that but we have much more to learn 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.019
 a total of 2 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.480
 with the feeding thing when I have to start using a toothbrush 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.819
 for weights guarantees teething 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.779
 where you start 1 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:10.449
 when it starts 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.849
 all these questions are very good 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.979
 and I have some answers 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.650
 what the dentist told me is I'm glad we decided not to stain his 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.209
 baby 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.040
 zarrías that breastfeeding does not help to promote the proper development of the 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.779
 Jaw in the baby's mouth 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.319
 Remember, it never costs the blood of the economy, but in the bed the babies who 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.389
 go to sleep with a bottle are more at risk of developing tooth decay 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.309
 something else the dentist told me 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:43.609
 the people who take care of the baby should not share with him covered 

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:47.550
 that they dental these cases that really surprised me 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.860
 that the microbes that cause cavities can transmit my mouth to my 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.420
 baby 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.240
 and cause decay in his time care and cleaning claim that this 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.199
 club is very important 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.770
 The baby's first teeth are important for the development of 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.969
 denture zone i have the important role depana in place for 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.150
 When the permanent teeth come out from newborn, the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.339
 Simplicity of your baby at least once a day with a soft cloth to 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.729
 remove the microbes that can accumulate after each 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:21.740
 feeding 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.889
 As soon as the first tooth appears, start using a toothbrush 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.910
 to drink and water to clean the teeth 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.180
 It is also important to lift on the lips and check and all the teeth 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.740
 days if white spots touch you could be an early sign of 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.629
 charity 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.969
 another thing that I remember so that your baby has teeth and gums tanos 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.529
 make sure you have a certain small business 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.199
 when the baby are ready to eat solid foods such foods 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.680
 all the dance groups of the digestive tube fruit drinks or caracas 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.310
 finally the dentist told him 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.360
 be careful when using the money 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.470
 Any habit that they allow must carry the money is not enough a tacit 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.030
 with mouthpiece in the mouth 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.909
 during the day or for long periods can cause cancer 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.770
 and this can happen even if neoliberal formula or breast milk arrives 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.870
 I never supported lost in something so that the glutton baby 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.499
 never put the baby to bed with a bottle 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:27.409
 let the baby begin to use a card at six months of age 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.490
 gradually the money or the capital 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.199
 between 12 and 14 months the baby must have left the bottle by 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.509
 complete starts program 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:39.820
 regular appointments with the dentist 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.309
 close to the baby's first birthday 

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:45.309
 to detect streets or any other problem 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.379
 if it starts from small 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:51.539
 the baby is used to going to the dentist 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.069
 so take it from small and carry or periodically 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.240
 Really, you gave me a lot that I thought about going 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.060
 now they would be buried to keep this note to what is this apparently 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.089
 much more than seven days ago 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:10.619
 It's time to make an appointment with the dentist for me and for loving you 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:15.719
 if you are going to be we are in ropes of the room cradle of the afternoon in total 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.550

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.940
 pt do not want a few minutes but tell me they have chosen prestigious name we found 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.490

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.169
 I will answer
