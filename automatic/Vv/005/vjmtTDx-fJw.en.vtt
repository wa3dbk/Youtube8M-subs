00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello everyone so today I decided to do

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.630 
hello everyone so today I decided to do
a<00:00:03.659> little<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.290> sampler<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.130> trying<00:00:05.460> out

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
a little bit of a sampler I'm trying out

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.270 
a little bit of a sampler I'm trying out
new<00:00:06.379> doodles<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.589> haven't<00:00:07.950> tried<00:00:08.220> before

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
new doodles that I haven't tried before

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.879 
new doodles that I haven't tried before
and<00:00:09.150> instead<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> just<00:00:09.990> doing<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.380> straight

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and instead of just doing a straight

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.459 
and instead of just doing a straight
grid<00:00:11.309> line<00:00:11.519> pattern<00:00:12.059> for<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.780> tangles<00:00:13.230> I'm

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
grid line pattern for the tangles I'm

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.010 
grid line pattern for the tangles I'm
breaking<00:00:14.040> up<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.309> squares<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.089> using<00:00:15.870> these

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
breaking up the squares and using these

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.320 
breaking up the squares and using these
little<00:00:16.320> squiggly<00:00:17.070> design<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.029> all<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.210> way

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
little squiggly design to go all the way

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.080 
little squiggly design to go all the way
around<00:00:18.650> this<00:00:19.650> first<00:00:19.949> design<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.699> came<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.060> with

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
around this first design I came up with

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.040 
around this first design I came up with
on<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.359> own

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
on my own

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.950 
on my own
just<00:00:22.590> playing<00:00:22.830> around<00:00:23.359> doodling<00:00:24.359> last<00:00:24.689> night

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
just playing around doodling last night

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.700 
just playing around doodling last night
well<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> bed<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:27.720> think<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.260> came<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.529> kind

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
well in bed and I think it came out kind

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.350 
well in bed and I think it came out kind
of<00:00:28.890> neat<00:00:29.869> it's<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.920> bubbly<00:00:32.579> 8

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
of neat it's just like a little bubbly 8

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.620 
of neat it's just like a little bubbly 8
and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.980> did<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.550> interesting<00:00:35.910> shading

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and then I did some interesting shading

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.340 
and then I did some interesting shading
and<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:38.120> came<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.540> tangle<00:00:39.989> patterns

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
and this one came off of tangle patterns

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
and this one came off of tangle patterns
calm<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.250> can't<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> name<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
calm and I can't think of the name of it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
calm and I can't think of the name of it
awesome<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.440> top<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.860> head<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:44.219> but

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
awesome the top of my head right now but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.569 
awesome the top of my head right now but
I<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:44.960> link<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.320> below<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.399> find

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I will link it down below if I can find

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.529 
I will link it down below if I can find
it<00:00:47.820> again<00:00:49.489> it's<00:00:50.489> basically<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> yin-yang

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it again it's basically like a yin-yang

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.520 
it again it's basically like a yin-yang
type<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.500> design<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> little

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
type of design and then a little

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.099 
type of design and then a little
flourish<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.010> middle<00:00:56.280> there<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.109> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
flourish in the middle there and this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.869 
flourish in the middle there and this
one<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> came<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:59.010> my<00:00:59.190> own<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
one I came up with on my own just on the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
one I came up with on my own just on the
fly<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.510> didn't<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:01.140> wouldn't<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.469> what

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
fly I didn't really wouldn't know what

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.380 
fly I didn't really wouldn't know what
to<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> space<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:03.059> kind<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to do with this space so I just kind of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
to do with this space so I just kind of
came<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.489> drawing

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
came up with something as I was drawing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.640 
came up with something as I was drawing
along<00:01:06.170> they<00:01:07.170> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> looked<00:01:07.619> like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
along they kind of looked like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.520 
along they kind of looked like
exclamation<00:01:08.189> points<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
exclamation points I think and then I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
exclamation points I think and then I
just<00:01:10.770> shaded<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.610> white<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
just shaded where it was white just to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.370 
just shaded where it was white just to
add<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:14.010> interest<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.380> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
add a little bit more interest to it and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.280 
add a little bit more interest to it and
then<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.180> took<00:01:18.600> off<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> Kingo

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
then this one I took off of Kingo

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.940 
then this one I took off of Kingo
patterns<00:01:19.909> as<00:01:20.909> well<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:22.229> link<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.740> one

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
patterns as well I will link that one

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
patterns as well I will link that one
down<00:01:23.430> below<00:01:23.670> too<00:01:24.330> cuz<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.720> can't<00:01:24.930> think<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
down below too cuz I can't think of the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.580 
down below too cuz I can't think of the
name<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.659> this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.110> basic

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
name of it and this is just basic

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.190 
name of it and this is just basic
triangle<00:01:29.189> lines<00:01:29.820> nothing<00:01:30.750> too<00:01:30.960> interesting

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
triangle lines nothing too interesting

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
triangle lines nothing too interesting
there<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> off<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.090> tangle

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there and then this is off of tangle

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.340 
there and then this is off of tangle
patterns<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.840> remember<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
patterns as well I don't remember the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
patterns as well I don't remember the
name<00:01:40.530> big<00:01:41.189> surprise<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:44.490> last<00:01:44.790> one

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
name big surprise and then this last one

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.679 
name big surprise and then this last one
here<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.950> not<00:01:46.950> taking<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> tangle

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
here is not taking off the tangle

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.460 
here is not taking off the tangle
patterns

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
patterns

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.660 
patterns
um<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.210> created<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> fly<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.799> just

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
um I created it just on the fly and just

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370 
um I created it just on the fly and just
kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> trying<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> fill<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.689> space<00:01:54.930> there

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
kind of trying to fill up space there

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.690 
kind of trying to fill up space there
and<00:01:56.869> then<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.530> went<00:01:58.890> back<00:01:59.070> through<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and then I just went back through and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
and then I just went back through and
shaded<00:02:00.090> different<00:02:00.450> areas<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> add<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
shaded different areas just to add a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.270 
shaded different areas just to add a
little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.770> more<00:02:02.040> interest<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:04.280> that's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
little bit more interest and that's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.730 
little bit more interest and that's
about<00:02:05.460> all<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.200> hope<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.380> enjoyed<00:02:07.710> today's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
about all I hope you enjoyed today's
