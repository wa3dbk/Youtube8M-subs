which<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> quite<00:00:50.100> handy<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.579> you're<00:00:50.760> doing

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
which is quite handy if you're doing

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
which is quite handy if you're doing
something<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.390> several<00:00:51.719> different<00:00:51.870> stages

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
something in several different stages

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
something in several different stages
let's<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> test<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> test<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
let's do a test now this is a test to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
let's do a test now this is a test to
check<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.420> talk<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.559> how<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> works<00:00:59.070> as

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
check how I talk and see how it works as

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
check how I talk and see how it works as
we<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.969> see<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.420> recording<00:01:00.899> there

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
we can see when we're recording there

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
we can see when we're recording there
are<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> set<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> green<00:01:01.739> bars<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.340> showing<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
are a set of green bars here showing the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
are a set of green bars here showing the
input<00:01:03.390> volume<00:01:03.600> which<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.140> quite<00:01:04.350> handy<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
input volume which is quite handy so you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 
input volume which is quite handy so you
can<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.489> whether<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> volume<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.450> loud

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
can see whether the volume is loud

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
can see whether the volume is loud
enough<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.340> format<00:01:08.340> correctly<00:01:08.460> you've<00:01:09.240> also

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
enough to format correctly you've also

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
enough to format correctly you've also
got<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:09.869> information<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.710> size<00:01:10.979> over

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
got some information about the size over

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
got some information about the size over
the<00:01:11.430> file<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.330> time<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.810> recorded<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the file and the time it was recorded I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
the file and the time it was recorded I
compressed<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.430> stop<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.880> again<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
compressed to stop here again in the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
compressed to stop here again in the
same<00:01:15.570> place<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.439> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
same place as you can see there's a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
same place as you can see there's a
paused<00:01:17.310> indication<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.659> says

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
paused indication there and it says

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
paused indication there and it says
pressed<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.259> resume<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:20.250> either<00:01:20.340> continue

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
pressed to resume I can either continue

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.910 
pressed to resume I can either continue
