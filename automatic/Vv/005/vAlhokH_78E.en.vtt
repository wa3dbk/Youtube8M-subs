00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
mastered the basics of lines and curves

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.990 
mastered the basics of lines and curves
that<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.830> start<00:00:26.279> putting<00:00:26.609> them<00:00:26.789> together

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that and start putting them together

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.179 
that and start putting them together
into<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.960> variety<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.439> shapes<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> can

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
into a variety of shapes then you can

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.130 
into a variety of shapes then you can
move<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.910> more<00:00:30.029> fun<00:00:30.300> stuff<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.750> drawing

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
move on to more fun stuff like drawing

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.319 
move on to more fun stuff like drawing
vines<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.009> leaves<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.550> buds<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.030> that's<00:00:33.180> what

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
vines and leaves and buds so that's what

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.389 
vines and leaves and buds so that's what
I'm<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> show<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.170> do<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.710> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
I'm going to show you how to do now so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
I'm going to show you how to do now so
you<00:00:35.489> start<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> simple<00:00:36.510> line<00:00:39.079> just<00:00:40.079> laying

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you start with a simple line just laying

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
you start with a simple line just laying
it<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.090> then<00:00:42.090> fixing<00:00:42.540> any<00:00:42.719> little

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it down and then fixing any little

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.959 
it down and then fixing any little
breaks<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
breaks like that and then one of the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.590 
breaks like that and then one of the
simplest<00:00:45.450> leaves<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.050> draw<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
simplest leaves to draw is like this and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.529 
simplest leaves to draw is like this and
all<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.559> doing<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:50.129> squeezing<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> holding

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
all I'm doing is squeezing and holding

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
all I'm doing is squeezing and holding
the<00:00:51.660> bottle<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.199> place<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.890> letting

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the bottle in one place and then letting

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
the bottle in one place and then letting
up<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> squeezing<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> pulling<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.960> out

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
up on the squeezing and pulling it out

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
up on the squeezing and pulling it out
and<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> gives<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> really<00:00:56.789> nice<00:00:57.059> little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
and it gives you a really nice little

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
and it gives you a really nice little
leaf<00:00:57.660> shape<00:00:57.960> very<00:00:58.320> simple<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
leaf shape very simple you can do a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
leaf shape very simple you can do a
variation<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.660> by<00:01:01.590> having<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.309> little

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
variation of this by having a little

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
variation of this by having a little
stem<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.449> squeezing<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> bottle<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
stem and then squeezing the bottle and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
stem and then squeezing the bottle and
holding<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> create<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.580> body<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
holding it to create the body of the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.380 
holding it to create the body of the
leaf<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:08.060> creating<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> tip

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
leaf and then this just creating the tip

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
leaf and then this just creating the tip
of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> leaf<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.049> again<00:01:10.950> create<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> stem

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of the leaf so again create the stem

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
of the leaf so again create the stem
hold<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> bottle<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.020> place<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.770> then

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
hold the bottle in one place and then

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
hold the bottle in one place and then
let<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> pressure<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.689> just

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
let up on the pressure and then just

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.170 
let up on the pressure and then just
pull<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
pull it out and you can just kind of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.520 
pull it out and you can just kind of
play<00:01:18.420> around<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
play around with this and do a lot of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
play around with this and do a lot of
different<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.340> shapes<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:21.600> do

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
different little shapes you can also do

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.310 
different little shapes you can also do
a<00:01:21.900> long<00:01:22.290> squiggly<00:01:23.070> leaf<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.780> squeezing<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.080> as

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a long squiggly leaf by squeezing it as

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
a long squiggly leaf by squeezing it as
you<00:01:25.799> wiggle<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:29.180> then<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.420> also<00:01:30.540> do

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you wiggle it and then you can also do

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
you wiggle it and then you can also do
an<00:01:30.869> open<00:01:31.229> leaf<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> do<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.790> stem<00:01:33.090> like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
an open leaf so you do your stem like

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.660 
an open leaf so you do your stem like
that<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.229> taper<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.250> then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that and then just taper it off and then

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.969 
that and then just taper it off and then
you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.820> create<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.530> outside<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> leaf

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you can create the outside of the leaf

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.050 
you can create the outside of the leaf
like<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> also<00:01:41.280> do<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:41.700> empty

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
like this and you can also do an empty

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.080 
like this and you can also do an empty
leaf<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090 

so<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.870> how<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.080> draw<00:01:52.350> leaves<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:52.950> buds

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
so that's how you draw leaves and buds

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.080 
so that's how you draw leaves and buds
on<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.910> vine<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.770> also<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.790> change

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
on a vine and then also you can change

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.270 
on a vine and then also you can change
things<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.810> creating<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> curved

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
things up by creating a kind of curved

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.990 
things up by creating a kind of curved
vine<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:02.250> creating<00:02:02.760> little

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
vine like this and then creating little

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.240 
vine like this and then creating little
leaves<00:02:03.300> off<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.900> you<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:05.610> alternate<00:02:06.119> them

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
leaves off of it you can alternate them
