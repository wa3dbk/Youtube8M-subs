this match I want to explain my
reasoning<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.040> why<00:00:11.130> am<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.550> already<00:00:11.940> running<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
reasoning of why am I already running a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.970 
reasoning of why am I already running a
layout<00:00:12.750> when<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> made<00:00:13.230> it<00:00:13.349> clear<00:00:13.380> i'm<00:00:13.710> gonna<00:00:13.889> be

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
layout when I made it clear i'm gonna be

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.820 
layout when I made it clear i'm gonna be
doing<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.730> every<00:00:15.059> fifth<00:00:15.269> match<00:00:15.560> the<00:00:16.560> reason

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
doing it in every fifth match the reason

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.330 
doing it in every fifth match the reason
this<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.670> because<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> definitely<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this is is because this is definitely a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890 
this is is because this is definitely a
different<00:00:20.730> approach<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.840> be

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
different approach this is going to be

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.620 
different approach this is going to be
much<00:00:22.140> more<00:00:22.170> rare<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.949> my<00:00:23.100> channel<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:23.760> it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
much more rare on my channel to see it's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
much more rare on my channel to see it's
not<00:00:24.810> going<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.230> frequent<00:00:25.590> as<00:00:25.769> other

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
not going to be as frequent as other

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.189

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the guy already goes rock slide the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
the guy already goes rock slide the
amount<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.000> damage<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:39.450> did<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.439> take

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
amount of damage they did not gonna take

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
amount of damage they did not gonna take
another<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.610> i<00:01:41.640> decided<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> sext<00:01:42.540> raptor

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
another one so i decided to sext raptor

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.440 
another one so i decided to sext raptor
which<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.880> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
which is when I think about it the more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
which is when I think about it the more
appropriate<00:01:46.140> approach<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> didn't<00:01:47.700> do

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
appropriate approach but I didn't do

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.969 
appropriate approach but I didn't do
that<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.350> switch<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:50.060> my<00:01:51.060> Salomon's

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
that so switch out to my my Salomon's

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.990 
that so switch out to my my Salomon's
summons<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.100> gonna<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> dragon<00:01:53.850> call

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
summons is gonna go for the dragon call

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.399 
summons is gonna go for the dragon call
because<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.780> earthquake

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
because I don't really have earthquake

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.590 
because I don't really have earthquake
up<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.770> Devlin<00:01:56.189> gone<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.460> earthquake<00:01:56.880> he<00:01:57.450> does

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
up to Devlin gone for earthquake he does

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
you know are more of a defensive one

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.780 
you know are more of a defensive one
without<00:02:09.380> having<00:02:09.649> special<00:02:10.040> defensive<00:02:10.460> maybe<00:02:10.700> I

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
without having special defensive maybe I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.340 
without having special defensive maybe I
could<00:02:11.060> have<00:02:11.120> taken<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.540> but<00:02:11.720> doesn't<00:02:12.320> really

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
could have taken it but doesn't really

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.020 
could have taken it but doesn't really
matter<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:12.950> he<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.310> reviews<00:02:13.850> me

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
matter then he actually reviews me

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.780 
matter then he actually reviews me
double<00:02:14.450> fairy<00:02:14.780> offensive<00:02:15.530> which<00:02:16.400> is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
double fairy offensive which is

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.970 
double fairy offensive which is
something<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.600> only<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.350> beginner<00:02:18.710> would

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
something that only a beginner would

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.310 
something that only a beginner would
probably<00:02:19.400> use<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.820> again<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:20.900> all<00:02:20.990> start

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
probably use and again we all start

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.110 
probably use and again we all start
somewhere<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.770> eventually<00:02:22.370> he<00:02:22.580> will<00:02:22.790> start<00:02:23.060> to

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
somewhere so eventually he will start to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.030 
somewhere so eventually he will start to
realize<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:23.750> not<00:02:23.870> really<00:02:24.290> what's<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
realize that's not really what's the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.780 
realize that's not really what's the
most<00:02:25.280> preferable<00:02:25.910> set<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.900> xerneas<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.980> I'm

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
most preferable set on xerneas but I'm

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.550 
most preferable set on xerneas but I'm
just<00:02:29.150> says<00:02:29.360> reach<00:02:29.600> out<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.900> count<00:02:30.080> flame<00:02:30.320> I'm

glass which we don't really take all

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
it's kind of scary especially if we do

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.220
