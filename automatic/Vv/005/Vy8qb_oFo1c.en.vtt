eyeshadows that I don't use that often
and<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> obviously<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.520> small

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and this is obviously just a very small

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
and this is obviously just a very small
example<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.350> experiment

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
example but like I can really experiment

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.980 
example but like I can really experiment
with<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> things<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.630> make<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
with the things that I have and make the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.249 
with the things that I have and make the
most<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.439> what<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.659> have<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.960> lot

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
most of what I have because I have a lot

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.410 
most of what I have because I have a lot
and<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.799> enough<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:02.670> feeling<00:02:03.240> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and I have enough and that feeling of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
and I have enough and that feeling of
realizing<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.310> enough

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
realizing that what you have is enough

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.960 
realizing that what you have is enough
is<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.750> huge<00:02:07.320> sort<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> weight<00:02:08.729> off<00:02:08.940> your

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
is a huge sort of weight off your

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.490 
is a huge sort of weight off your
shoulders<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.780> there's<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.229> lot<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
shoulders and there's also a lot of

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.869 
shoulders and there's also a lot of
freedom<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.790> lot

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
freedom and that because you have a lot

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.170 
freedom and that because you have a lot
of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
of

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.809 
of
room<00:02:12.359> to<00:02:12.629> explore<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.379> obviously<00:02:14.159> makeup<00:02:14.670> is

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
room to explore and obviously makeup is

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.390 
room to explore and obviously makeup is
just<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.329> very<00:02:15.569> small<00:02:15.689> example<00:02:16.439> even<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.219> with

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
just a very small example even like with

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.819 
just a very small example even like with
school<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.239> with<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:19.019> friendships<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
school and with your friendships and

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.039 
school and with your friendships and
your<00:02:19.980> relationships<00:02:20.819> like<00:02:21.030> let's<00:02:21.239> say<00:02:21.390> you

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
your relationships like let's say you

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.839 
your relationships like let's say you
really<00:02:22.079> want<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.769> be<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.099> relationship<00:02:23.250> but

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
really want to be in a relationship but

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.839 
really want to be in a relationship but
you<00:02:23.969> haven't<00:02:24.329> found<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.629> right<00:02:24.659> person<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
you haven't found the right person I

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.550 
you haven't found the right person I
think<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:26.909> doing<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.019> what<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.319> have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
think that doing more with what you have

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.309 
think that doing more with what you have
means<00:02:29.159> putting<00:02:29.760> yourself<00:02:30.209> out<00:02:30.329> there<00:02:30.420> means

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
means putting yourself out there means

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.559 
means putting yourself out there means
hanging<00:02:31.769> out<00:02:32.069> with<00:02:32.250> your<00:02:32.370> friends<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.030> saying

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
hanging out with your friends and saying

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.890 
hanging out with your friends and saying
yes<00:02:33.959> when<00:02:34.200> they<00:02:34.560> invite<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:36.000> group

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
yes when they invite you to group

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.229 
yes when they invite you to group
situations<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.889> group<00:02:38.129> parties<00:02:38.639> and<00:02:38.939> you

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
situations and group parties and you

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.970 
situations and group parties and you
know<00:02:39.359> different<00:02:39.659> events<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.379> may<00:02:40.650> not

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
know different events that you may not

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.009 
know different events that you may not
normally<00:02:41.219> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:41.939> to<00:02:42.000> maybe<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:42.750> you

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
normally want to go to maybe because you

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.509 
normally want to go to maybe because you
don't<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.439> date<00:02:43.680> or<00:02:44.069> because<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
don't have a date or because you

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.839 
don't have a date or because you
wouldn't<00:02:44.819> know<00:02:44.939> very<00:02:45.269> many<00:02:45.450> people<00:02:45.959> but<00:02:46.470> maybe

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
wouldn't know very many people but maybe

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.059 
wouldn't know very many people but maybe
the<00:02:47.849> idea<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.720> doing<00:02:48.989> more<00:02:49.439> with<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
the idea of doing more with what you

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.759 
the idea of doing more with what you
have<00:02:50.340> means<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.900> will<00:02:52.079> say<00:02:52.319> yes<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
have means that you will say yes to

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.619 
have means that you will say yes to
those<00:02:52.889> things<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.609> will<00:02:53.819> go<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.419> those

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
those things that you will go on those

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.830 
those things that you will go on those
impromptu<00:02:55.409> trips<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.129> that<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.669> go<00:02:57.480> on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
impromptu trips or that you will go on

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.170 
impromptu trips or that you will go on
those<00:02:58.260> outings<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.159> those<00:02:59.430> events<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> that

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
those outings and those events and that

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390 
those outings and those events and that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
maybe you will meet someone and even if

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.039 
maybe you will meet someone and even if
you<00:03:02.519> don't<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.329> know<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> went

out<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.319> that<00:03:04.769> again<00:03:05.159> I've<00:03:05.430> said<00:03:05.639> in<00:03:05.730> videos

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
out and that again I've said in videos

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.000 
out and that again I've said in videos
before<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.569> there's<00:03:06.750> no<00:03:06.900> wasted<00:03:07.260> effort<00:03:07.620> and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
before that there's no wasted effort and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830 
before that there's no wasted effort and
you<00:03:08.159> never<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.609> like<00:03:08.639> who<00:03:09.510> you'll<00:03:09.810> meet

through people you meet so maybe you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.879 
through people you meet so maybe you

introduce<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.629> the<00:03:18.720> person<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.109> you

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
introduce you to the person that you

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:31.309 
introduce you to the person that you
fall<00:03:19.500> madly<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.889> love<00:03:19.949> with<00:03:20.129> you<00:03:20.159> never<00:03:20.489> know

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.800 

I<00:03:34.849> think<00:03:35.849> it's<00:03:35.969> important<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.420> remember<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
I think it's important to remember that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.239 
I think it's important to remember that
the<00:03:37.019> sentence<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.499> came<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.920> me<00:03:38.040> was<00:03:38.069> a

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:38.249 
the sentence that came to me was a

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.599 
the sentence that came to me was a
two-part<00:03:38.730> sentence<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.359> was<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.310> with

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
two-part sentence it was do more with

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.059 
two-part sentence it was do more with
what<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.879> have<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.620> eventually<00:03:43.620> you'll<00:03:43.799> have

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
what you have and eventually you'll have

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.099 
what you have and eventually you'll have
more<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.599> part<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.930> really

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
more and I think that part is really

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.839 
more and I think that part is really
important<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.650> remember<00:03:46.889> and<00:03:47.219> eventually

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
important to remember and eventually

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.789 
important to remember and eventually
you'll<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.269> more<00:03:48.599> and<00:03:48.870> that's<00:03:49.409> why<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> think

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
you'll have more and that's why I think

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.920 
you'll have more and that's why I think
it's<00:03:50.040> important<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.549> keep<00:03:50.819> those<00:03:51.030> goals<00:03:51.689> in

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
it's important to keep those goals in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.770 
it's important to keep those goals in
mind<00:03:52.109> into<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:53.549> want<00:03:53.969> things<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.540> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
mind into and to want things and to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.420 
mind into and to want things and to
desire<00:03:55.019> things<00:03:55.530> because<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.889> think<00:03:55.950> it's<00:03:56.250> good

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
desire things because I think it's good

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
desire things because I think it's good
to<00:03:56.459> have<00:03:56.700> dreams<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.180> goals<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.019> think<00:03:58.349> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
to have dreams and goals but I think the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.009 
to have dreams and goals but I think the
more<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.010> do<00:03:59.250> with<00:03:59.489> what<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.879> have<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.780> more

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
more you do with what you have the more

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.440 
more you do with what you have the more
you'll<00:04:01.290> appreciate<00:04:01.769> what<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.609> get<00:04:02.849> later<00:04:03.120> and

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
you'll appreciate what you get later and

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.110 
you'll appreciate what you get later and
the<00:04:04.079> more<00:04:04.379> you'll<00:04:05.129> be<00:04:05.280> able<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.489> handle<00:04:06.000> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the more you'll be able to handle it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.599 
the more you'll be able to handle it
whatever<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.629> is<00:04:06.750> because<00:04:07.409> maybe<00:04:07.609> whatever

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
whatever it is because maybe whatever

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.129 
whatever it is because maybe whatever
this<00:04:08.909> is<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.480> don't<00:04:09.659> even<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:10.019> what
