professional<00:01:34.110> runner<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.790> know<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.299> gonna

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
professional runner I know I was gonna

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.200 
professional runner I know I was gonna
ask<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.229> wore<00:01:37.439> something<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> decided

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
ask if I wore something so I decided

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.490 
ask if I wore something so I decided
that<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.780> me<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.290> some

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that it's good for me to get some

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.679 
that it's good for me to get some
exercise<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:46.979> that's<00:01:47.430> why<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> thought<00:01:47.850> every

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
exercise so that's why I thought every

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.100 
exercise so that's why I thought every
day<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.500> gonna<00:01:49.619> take<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.159> time<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.670> myself

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
day I'm gonna take some time for myself

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.510 
day I'm gonna take some time for myself
