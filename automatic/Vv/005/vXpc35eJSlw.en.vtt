00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.890
 Hi, we're going to talk about the 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:18.750
 worldly comedy of luiz biajoni fgv um 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 compilation of three detective novels 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 are narrated in the third person 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 novels are divided into scenes and not 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.000
 in chapters in each scene the narrator 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 focus on a different character what 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 makes none of them obfuscate 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 during the narrative here none 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.500
 character is at the service of another 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 quite the opposite, each of them has 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 your own goals your own 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 worries what is enough 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 interesting because it's very tiring 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
 when you see in other books that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 the characters are there just to serve the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.289
 a protagonist of the novel follows a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 pattern 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.710
 At first we do not understand very well. 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 any connection of the characters one with 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 the other and not what the events 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the first scenes honda but according to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.850
 people are advancing in the law everyone 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.930
 realizes that everything really has a 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.399
 Link 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 this story takes place inside 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.000
 Sao Paulo is something I found very 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.100
 cool of this book is as narrator goes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.049
 counting every hour a family at the end 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 You just meet the whole city. 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.170
 just to show every little bit 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.970
 of the city we get the impression 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 that this book has no tip 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.140
 drop same characters that have less 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.509
 highlight take your five minutes 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.580
 of fame at some point no one escapes 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.460
 Swimmer sharp tongue the police 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.470
 government to church the sensationalist media 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.060
 are unmasked all the time here 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.799
 first novel about a girl who 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.259

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.270
 own shopkeeper during a consultation with 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.860
 second is about a married guy with daughter 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240

 middle-aged pastor that is here is a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.240
 most original police book I've ever 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.500
 I met 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.659
 What annoyed me in this book here? 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.790
 were the dialogues in each of the three 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.740
 novels have conversations that are not 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.810
 very much in keeping with the characters who 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.579
 They showed us a criminal without 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.009
 cute talking schooling using a 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.750
 metaphor to complex a teenager 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.009
 talking with colleagues talking about 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.180
 words that have nothing to do with a 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.740
 informal dialogue 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750
 that was one of the things that bothered me 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.129
 a little but this type of situation does not 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 end the experience I had with 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.069
 this book the author has created several 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.569
 characters that were not simply 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.370
 good or bad and was still very loud 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.739
 souza treat the themes that are portrayed 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.499
 in the stories as secretary who made me 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.499
 read more than 100 pages per day 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.450
