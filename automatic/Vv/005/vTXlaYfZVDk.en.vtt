00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.310
 today we are going to make this gift 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.069
 our channel for Super Godmother 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 that we're going to need tie scissors 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 cardboard a star with a hole in it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.980
 center if it is not easier we can 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.179
 print the pattern that we have our 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.970
 page on facebook but in the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.700
 description well we start cutting 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.220
 our star we cut it from a 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.190
 plain paper that we have printed now what 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.470
 We turn to cardboard we copy the silhouette in 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.570
 a harder cardboard and what we do 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.150
 now it's cut out that cardboard 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.620
 once we have cut out the silhouette 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.000
 in our star we have to do the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.820
 hole in the center that will serve us 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.250
 then to gather the bow we started 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.450
 passing one end of the loop the other nor 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.809
 we have cut it, we leave it 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.070
 all that we need, calculating that 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.750
 that is what will be the roll later 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.059
 of the center is to say that there is enough 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.120
 tie is the one for the staple or the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.970
 stitch that we put now we hold by 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.220
 down this principle and we went through a 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.650
 from the corners of our star one 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.660
 from the ends the loop and then we passed 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.700
 by the tip that is in front of form 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.280
 that the bond always goes through the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.369
 center of the star once this is done 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.979
 we also go through the center to another 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.259
 from the tips of the star you see 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.930
 we pass the loop always over the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.270
 tip of the star and now we go to the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.130
 star point that is facing 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.920
 the one that we just passed the loop this is 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.660
 the technique from end to end and always 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 more confronted than we can for the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.720
 tie behind is the most centered 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.370
 possible to see once we give the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 first return to our star 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.680
 we continue doing the same with 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.660
 later turns if we look through 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.060
 behind we see that the ties always 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.620
 come together in a center that will be 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
 important for the bow to look good 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.250
 well then now we put the second 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.220
 back even the third round how many 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.830
 more you put more volume will then have the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.530
 moÃ±a vale but well let's leave it 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.140
 we in three turns do the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.110
 three laps and now what are we going to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.240
 to do is staple with a staple we record 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.550
 the center so that all ties 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.020
 behind they stay together you have to have 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.700
 beware of this but what we can 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.680
 do is give a stitch since the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.720
 tie we have used is good satin 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.970
 Well now we just have to go pulling 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.920
 our little bows of the tips of the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.990
 I cut the tip a little bit to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.930
 make it easier to take them out and I do not know 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.630
 break my pattern, well, you go little to 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.700
 little taking them out of all the tips and 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.430
 once we have removed what we do is you can 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.130
 put it a little better we are opening 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.590
 let's say all our ties once 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.240
 open we only have to put the loop of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
 center towards the other side that we put it 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.870
 with a little bit of zeal 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.870
 of glue and it's already very easy
