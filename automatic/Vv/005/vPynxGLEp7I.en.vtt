really is and I'm gonna put the link
down<00:00:33.489> below<00:00:33.760> for<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.210> build<00:00:34.420> if<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.600> want<00:00:34.750> to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:34.810 
down below for the build if you want to

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.330 
down below for the build if you want to
check<00:00:35.020> it<00:00:35.170> out<00:00:35.290> because<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.680> took<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.130> and<00:00:36.250> I

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
check it out because I took it and I

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.790 
check it out because I took it and I
turned<00:00:36.640> it<00:00:36.790> into<00:00:36.970> TNT<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.470> think<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:38.710> looks

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
turned it into TNT and I think it looks

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.830 
turned it into TNT and I think it looks
even<00:00:38.980> cooler<00:00:39.220> now<00:00:39.520> except<00:00:40.150> I<00:00:40.240> left<00:00:40.420> this<00:00:40.540> cap

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
even cooler now except I left this cap

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.120 
even cooler now except I left this cap
because<00:00:40.990> we<00:00:41.170> wouldn't<00:00:41.470> be<00:00:41.590> able<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.800> see<00:00:42.010> the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
because we wouldn't be able to see the

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.670 
because we wouldn't be able to see the
epic<00:00:42.460> M<00:00:42.640> there<00:00:43.000> if<00:00:43.150> I<00:00:43.270> turned<00:00:43.540> it<00:00:43.660> all<00:00:43.810> into<00:00:44.170> TNT

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
epic M there if I turned it all into TNT

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.280 
epic M there if I turned it all into TNT
but<00:00:45.400> yeah<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.700> build<00:00:45.970> is<00:00:46.180> absolutely<00:00:46.990> massive

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
but yeah the build is absolutely massive

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.650 
but yeah the build is absolutely massive
but<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.130> felt<00:00:48.430> like<00:00:48.520> we<00:00:48.579> needed<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.060> we<00:00:49.420> couldn't
