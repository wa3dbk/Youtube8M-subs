00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.640
 Today is lottery system now 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:12.120
 a The time is 137 pages 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.740
 Please devoted to the basic pattern 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 In you have to say what to say and that Well, a little or a problem or gold to do today, but it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.600
 A little big 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.880
 The 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.520
 Clean 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.750
 Want to go 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.440
 There is a story that is high 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 Because there is no similarity condition or something 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.590
 Um also we're starting with the premise Tteyuu's foundation 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.640
 It 's kind of like cleaning clothes like this if there is a solid 3 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.309
 For example 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 Or let's say something like, but there were dice Yes 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 This akanje 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.240
 Yes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.480
 Well for example 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.230
 3 cm here 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:10.170
 I thought that there were 3 centimeters of cat 5 centimeters of cat 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.170
 It entered talking What But occur, such a three-dimensional of in One to not cleaning the three-dimensional 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.500
 Everyone can not change about February surface area etc. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.930
 I heard that it is Oishi 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.190
 First of all 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.190
 The Shoji Mr. say so bark When you are told what body What are the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.250
 From fixing the day of the giants 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.730
 This does Mase talk I mean is industrial waste No. 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 Well 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.520
 And it rose cut this surface I factory Chocho 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.750
 I come in I I I surface was flat 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.750
 Day of surface area 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.380
 If it is said that what is already that flower owner facility until now 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.130
 There is a cleaning day, and I just put more than clear day 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.830
 OK 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 Well then 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.730
 Next 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 What would you do if you were told what a day of gallstones would be? 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 I remember the first of the month 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.010
 I will put on three 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.470
 Here's the end 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.610
 Still actual calculation car Nagoya this 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.870
 Southern triples with q Roma and 27 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.260
 Over the tree meeting in the afternoon 25 120 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.760
 It is such a story 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.670
 If there is a fan cleaning day, the day of surface area is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.520
 It will be the upper day of 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:11.580
 If it is said that the day of Oishi will be the day of Sanjo 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:15.920
 That's it, oh yeah I know that I remember something new and remember 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.550
 Well this is a continuation from now without anything 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.120
 In Well this 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.230
 Let's live today 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.750
 First of all do not come to express than what the annoying Nante day of this surface area 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 that 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.310
 If you want to do it, it 's already easy 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.310
 Because 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.470
 Similarity ratio is 4 to 6 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.780
 Tara is 1 Wattoi gonna be 4-to-6 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 I 'm leaving ! 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.680
 I am leaving! 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.270
 Then the day of surface area will come out 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.709
 Soft body what to say 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.350
 ok cellar 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.340
 4 to 9 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.340
 Just square 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.829
 Well that's the end 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.840
 The ratio of noodles surface area is 4 to 9 at Badesu 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.139
 So I 'm talking about Oishi next person 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.410
 p of the volume is something 16 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.510
 If it does not do anything, it is 16 cubic centimeters 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.560
 q is So and What is integrally 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.560
 Well x On the other hand the captain and fishing Well I Ja likely you do not know it this only 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.499
 I'm talking of that say hey What much 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.499
 Yes 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.569
 From this shoji and 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.480
 Similarity ratio that's Marnie: 3 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:59.540
 The cost of gallstones can not be determined from here but the date can not be determined 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.289
 I will come over if I do what to do 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.830
 Oishi is 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:09.160
 Please tell me what volume ratio will be getting rid of before 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.160
 Go 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.810
 OK 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.960
 8-20 resistant 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:29.030
 So this is my left mother's 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:30.639
 This this kind of story and I'll become the 8-resistant 27 as a result Once you have the old comparison of Pete Wicker 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.090
 Is it 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.090
 So 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.040
 16 cubic centimeters and 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:47.590
 eggs cubic centimeters and now I have become now 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:53.409
 Comparing these results in 8 and 27 say 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:58.880
 Ten good and x But these En hungry in this kind of strategy 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:01.870
 We know that the result that it will be 8 27 27 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.990
 Speaking inside the line also kun 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.289
 Outside folded 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.940
 I Ja do not do it calculates and 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:13.240
 Yeah it is and this little that Well calculate 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.199
 Ink installation 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.199
 54 columns or 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.169
 Of course there is no space, so I will omit either of them 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:29.670
 This is why 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:33.040
 Three years today talking about is if there is to say cleaning three-dimensional Once again 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:37.930
 First of all, you only need to find the side ratio normally 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:41.810
 It is the day of the above to Tteyuu the surface area of the day 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:45.950
 If it is said that the day of the unit seat is Sanjo day 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:49.940
 issei It is a curvy path I want you to know 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:52.600
 If irradiated 137 of 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.600
 Tran 4 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.880
 Shall we practice for a moment? 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.540
 Well then 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.540
 Please do practice
