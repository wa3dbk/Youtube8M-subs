with what i'm using by now so i won't go

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.670 
with what i'm using by now so i won't go
through<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.600> depth<00:00:21.840> anyway<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.560> into

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
through it in depth anyway we go into

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220

result<00:02:41.480> considering<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.090> said

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
result considering and like I said

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.040 
result considering and like I said
there's<00:02:45.450> not<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.690> be<00:02:45.750> any<00:02:45.900> more

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
there's not going to be any more

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.229 
there's not going to be any more
transferred<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.800> team<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.640> because<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
transferred to this team just because I

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.020 
transferred to this team just because I
don't<00:02:48.780> see<00:02:48.900> any<00:02:49.019> need<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.800> at<00:02:50.670> this<00:02:50.790> point

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
don't see any need to and at this point

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
don't see any need to and at this point
I<00:02:51.300> think<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.840> would<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.350> replacing

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
I think that it would just be replacing

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.580 
I think that it would just be replacing
players<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.730> were<00:02:53.880> similar<00:02:54.180> quality<00:02:54.810> for<00:02:55.560> a

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
players that were similar quality for a

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
players that were similar quality for a
lot<00:02:55.769> more<00:02:55.920> coins<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.600> any<00:02:57.750> point

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
lot more coins so I don't see any point

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
lot more coins so I don't see any point
in<00:02:58.050> changing<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.590> will<00:02:59.160> save<00:02:59.340> our<00:02:59.459> coins<00:02:59.730> for

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
in changing it will save our coins for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.920 
in changing it will save our coins for
