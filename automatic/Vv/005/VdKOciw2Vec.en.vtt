for most ability you know which proteins
are<00:00:08.990> good<00:00:09.349> to<00:00:09.469> take<00:00:09.710> which<00:00:09.980> fat<00:00:10.219> burners<00:00:10.550> are

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
are good to take which fat burners are

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.950 
are good to take which fat burners are
good<00:00:10.820> to<00:00:10.910> take<00:00:11.090> pre-workout<00:00:11.719> post-workout

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
stuff like that first let's talk about

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.640 
stuff like that first let's talk about
which<00:00:14.299> supplements<00:00:14.540> that<00:00:14.960> I<00:00:15.019> recommend<00:00:15.500> that

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
which supplements that I recommend that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.560 
which supplements that I recommend that
you<00:00:15.769> should<00:00:15.950> take<00:00:16.160> protein<00:00:16.640> best<00:00:17.210> time<00:00:17.420> to

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
you should take protein best time to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.480 
you should take protein best time to
take<00:00:17.690> protein<00:00:18.080> my<00:00:18.290> opinion<00:00:18.620> is<00:00:18.860> after<00:00:19.460> a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
take protein my opinion is after a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.580 
take protein my opinion is after a
workout<00:00:19.850> because<00:00:20.270> protein<00:00:21.020> will<00:00:21.260> kick<00:00:21.470> in

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
workout because protein will kick in

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.500 
workout because protein will kick in
faster<00:00:21.800> and<00:00:22.280> will<00:00:22.520> break<00:00:22.700> down<00:00:22.910> faster<00:00:23.330> be

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
faster and will break down faster be

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.210 
faster and will break down faster be
absorbed<00:00:23.930> faster<00:00:24.050> into<00:00:24.530> your<00:00:24.650> body<00:00:24.830> which<00:00:25.070> is

absorbed faster into your body which is

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.130 
absorbed faster into your body which is
most<00:00:25.430> important<00:00:25.880> right<00:00:26.060> after<00:00:26.720> a<00:00:26.750> workout

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140

take supplements those would be the ones
I'll<00:01:06.020> look<00:01:06.260> into<00:01:06.440> first<00:01:06.800> so<00:01:07.130> now<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.370> question

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580

is which ones are best for you the best
way<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.370> figure<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.700> out<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:11.090> really<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.990> go

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
way to figure it out is really to go

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.290 
way to figure it out is really to go
ahead<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.620> try<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:12.979> for<00:01:13.280> yourself<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.880> can<00:01:14.180> go

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
ahead and try it for yourself I can go

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.120 
ahead and try it for yourself I can go
ahead<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.659> tell<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.990> this<00:01:15.320> will<00:01:15.560> be<00:01:15.590> good<00:01:15.860> and
