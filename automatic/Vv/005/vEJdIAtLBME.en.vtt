00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.490
 Oh , I have something in it, please wait for a moment . 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.660
 cable with mic controller compatible with apple 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660
 Cat 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:24.430
 It looks like spa 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:26.800
 I can not open the bag for a while, but the 8-inch blue with that Apple mic controller 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.070
 It is already attached 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.070
 Yes 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.380
 It is in the back is after 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.930
 In addition, I have a premonition that seems to me 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.930
 I went to 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.740
 Oh in this 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.740
 I feel like many people do not notice this 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 husband 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 Oh what's this 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.870
 It is already amazing 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 This is positive 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:08.810
 It is a head that is often common, but this fastener is not so great 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.810
 I wonder if it is necessary or not 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.440
 Hey What Kazea mesh of hiphop 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.909
 Yes 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.700
 It's great, it feels good to touch 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.010
 This is incredible good this 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.690
 Yes It is the fastener than anything 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.690
 I like this most 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.380
 It is dm owner studio by saying 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.380
 Yan Blue Eddy 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.150
 This is wonderful 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.980
 It had also entered without manual something like 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.730
 8 user's manual and 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.540
 Ton strange or will do is to write so much 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.540
 What is written 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.100
 Yeah, this is anything from German 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.760
 I can not read it at all, but there are all Espanyol. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.760
 Die on 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.390
 It is about beech Well consisting Oh 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.150
 How many columns are there in Japan 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.489
 Japan language also had properly 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.050
 It is the last but 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.550
 Is it an ear cup 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.130
 How something also of the attachment of 8 removal of this side 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.400
 Because it is written properly 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.300
 It is made quite carefully 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.400
 It means that 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.950
 Oh well 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.230
 The following is how it looks fashionable 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.230
 After all the sound slips 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.600
 I finally thought I wanted to hide 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.160
 I'm listening to the top 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.160
 Pick up the 4th image 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.940
 It is feeling 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.520
 That's fine 8 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.819
 Sealed Caen 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.120
 I wonder if there is something like 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.060
 Or that cormorants do not know 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.989
 Though 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.540
 You can hear the sound of the outside quite well 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.430
 So it's probably not too stressful to talk to me 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.480
 Yes 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.530
 Somehow well 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.069
 I can talk 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.069
 I feel like I'm very good 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.110
 Oh dear 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.110
 It looks like this 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.710
 I've heard Dechotto 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.800
 It is something like yes 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.610
 understood 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.610
 8 is a ne 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:21.340
 Basically basically that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:24.780
 And because the ingredients that it is quite strong consciousness of an engineer eyes 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.349
 Quite that and had sentence 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.139
 I guess I'm I say 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:37.520
 The design is relatively simple, but it sounds like an offensive attack like a donshari. 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.720
 I have some stuff, but I do 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.000
 In this regard 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.560
 It is a split and finished with so much feeling reasonable 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.870
 That because 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:57.389
 Guy and one of the fruit Gold I leave with quite stunned Toka Anpanman Bambang burn 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.389
 But for this it is quite reasonable 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.410
 Lou Do you feel 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:09.000
 After 8 ways google is that engineer 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.460
 From that because doing well Toka produce industry 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.449
 I don't know if it's Mitsuguru 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.660
 It becomes a sound that does not get tired of listening 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.910
 Why 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.640
 I also feel that the ear cup is such a specification 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:30.030
 You do not even do not 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:34.560
 In regarding the first phase it is going 8 of Tteyuu just taste of slightly iii is 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.490
 It is not to say the Do not remain throat flat 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.770
 Hey Well 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:47.410
 Is it about mid-low range at regular intervals too 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:51.710
 Is usually uninstall dance music from Well kinda felt called Naa are raised 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:54.480
 It is recommended for favorite person 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.720
 How about jazz 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.940
 But say Oh What do 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.240
 If it is the old part of the blue note, it will disappear happily 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.270
 I think it's 9 fun even with old rock 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:15.360
 I wonder if it is classic 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:17.169
 Because I think that 6 Well in the first place the concept is different Yes I feel that I there is the array 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.340
 That very much 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.770
 Than I thought 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:27.020
 It was an article summary 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.729
 I thought it was a feeling of more advanced khan, but there was no such thing 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.080
 Yes 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.080
 I wish I could buy this 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.660
 Now 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.380
 Click now 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.070
 Not 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:45.400
 Don't go out yes 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:48.420
 It is a feeling by all means a head that can be in a long relationship with something like this 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.230
 I think it is surprising 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.280
 I also felt that it was a kind of popular tool. 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.120
 I want to go along with that long 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.170
 Gem in there well to take the plunge I might be a little high and may try to city 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.610
 I think this is 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.610
 Yes, was there a certain
