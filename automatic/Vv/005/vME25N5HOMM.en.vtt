 secularity would have declared I have a lot of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 reasons to sympathize with Santa Claus 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.850

 Christmas tree and Santa Claus have nothing 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.159
 religious 70 years ago 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 the laity of the time was too happy 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.380

 public 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.969
 where were the nursery 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.250
 fiercely banned while the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.990
 guardians of secularism are reassured and 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.460
 want to let the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440
 Christmas lights in the eyes of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.540
 amazed children 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.220
 in front of a tree they are not 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.350
 religious symbols so there is no 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.300
 undermining secularism
