00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
stable and basically we're doing a back

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.609 
stable and basically we're doing a back
extension<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.619> bend

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
extension so you're going to bend

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
extension so you're going to bend
towards<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.280> ball<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.820> extend<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.689> don't

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
over extend up too high because then you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
over extend up too high because then you
will<00:01:18.750> injure<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.320> hurt<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.500> back<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.640> once

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
will injure and hurt that back so once

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.810 
will injure and hurt that back so once
again<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.720> bending<00:01:21.900> down<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.670> going<00:01:23.670> up

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.120 
again you're bending down and going up
it's<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> small<00:01:24.780> motion<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.619> believe<00:01:25.860> me<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it's a small motion but believe me it

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's a small motion but believe me it
