the color I'm after I'm off to the side
here<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.199> think<00:04:31.289> I'm<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.220> much

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
here and I think I'm going to be much

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:42.730 
here and I think I'm going to be much
happier<00:04:32.669> with<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:35.990> little<00:04:36.990> bit

put<00:05:23.000> some<00:05:23.570> grass<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:24.050> here<00:05:24.260> next<00:05:24.680> thing<00:05:24.830> you

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
put some grass in here next thing you

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.330 
put some grass in here next thing you
know<00:05:25.070> you've<00:05:25.760> got<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.000> tree<00:05:26.410> now<00:05:27.410> I<00:05:27.710> have<00:05:28.130> not

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
know you've got a tree now I have not

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.030 
know you've got a tree now I have not
put<00:05:28.820> any<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.960> structure<00:05:30.470> of<00:05:30.590> the<00:05:30.680> tree<00:05:30.920> in

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
put any of the structure of the tree in

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.480 
put any of the structure of the tree in
there<00:05:31.960> thinking<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:33.080> trunks<00:05:33.620> limbs<00:05:34.190> and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
there thinking of trunks limbs and

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.680 
there thinking of trunks limbs and
branches<00:05:34.810> well<00:05:35.810> we<00:05:36.200> can<00:05:36.380> do<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.950> at<00:05:37.280> any<00:05:38.060> time

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
branches well we can do that at any time

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.630 
branches well we can do that at any time
now<00:05:39.050> there's<00:05:39.320> other<00:05:39.560> colors<00:05:40.070> we<00:05:40.250> are<00:05:40.310> going<00:05:40.550> to

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
now there's other colors we are going to

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.870 
now there's other colors we are going to
put<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:40.940> here<00:05:41.150> but<00:05:41.540> this<00:05:41.720> is<00:05:41.930> where<00:05:42.080> we<00:05:42.290> start

being said we are going to be practicing
that<00:05:54.110> stroke<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.950> number<00:05:55.310> of<00:05:55.430> times<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.750> what

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
that stroke a number of times so what

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.850 
that stroke a number of times so what
we're<00:05:57.380> going<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.620> do<00:05:57.800> now<00:05:58.010> is<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.820> take<00:05:59.860> we're

happen we end up with a beautiful stain
that<00:06:21.220> we<00:06:22.220> can<00:06:22.400> work<00:06:22.610> on

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:33.460 

I'm<00:06:26.789> using<00:06:27.240> mineral<00:06:27.569> spirits<00:06:28.020> as<00:06:28.560> my<00:06:28.949> solvent

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.719 

now<00:06:34.470> we're<00:06:34.680> going<00:06:34.889> to<00:06:34.979> go<00:06:35.159> through<00:06:35.400> a<00:06:35.430> lot<00:06:35.669> of

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
now we're going to go through a lot of

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.700 
now we're going to go through a lot of
paper<00:06:36.210> towels<00:06:38.180> but<00:06:39.180> that's<00:06:39.599> good<00:06:39.930> enough<00:06:40.080> now

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
paper towels but that's good enough now

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.540 
paper towels but that's good enough now
so<00:06:41.370> I<00:06:41.400> can<00:06:41.759> do<00:06:42.210> another<00:06:42.569> practice<00:06:43.110> one<00:06:43.349> you<00:06:44.129> you

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
so I can do another practice one you you

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.420 
so I can do another practice one you you
don't<00:06:44.789> put<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.030> lot<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.360> pressure<00:06:45.539> on<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:45.870> brush

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
don't put a lot of pressure on the brush

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.159 
don't put a lot of pressure on the brush
okay<00:06:47.430> basically<00:06:47.940> holding<00:06:48.599> it<00:06:48.750> with<00:06:48.900> three

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
okay basically holding it with three

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.399 
okay basically holding it with three
fingers<00:06:49.530> and<00:06:50.030> start<00:06:51.030> with<00:06:51.270> a<00:06:51.300> diagonal<00:06:51.810> stroke

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:52.409 
fingers and start with a diagonal stroke

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.279 
fingers and start with a diagonal stroke
and<00:06:52.680> it's<00:06:53.430> a<00:06:53.610> scribble

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
and it's a scribble

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.409 
and it's a scribble
it's<00:06:55.289> a<00:06:55.500> scribble<00:06:55.949> where<00:06:56.190> you're<00:06:56.610> not<00:06:56.819> using<00:06:57.120> a

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:57.419 
it's a scribble where you're not using a

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.430 
it's a scribble where you're not using a
two<00:06:57.960> inch<00:06:58.169> scribble<00:06:58.770> stroke<00:06:59.099> and<00:06:59.870> you<00:07:00.870> think

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
two inch scribble stroke and you think

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.649 
two inch scribble stroke and you think
in<00:07:01.590> terms<00:07:01.919> of<00:07:02.250> diagonals<00:07:03.349> and<00:07:05.449> you're<00:07:06.449> not

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
in terms of diagonals and you're not

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.760 
in terms of diagonals and you're not
putting<00:07:07.229> so<00:07:07.560> much<00:07:07.710> pressure<00:07:08.190> that<00:07:09.770> you're

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
putting so much pressure that you're

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.600 
putting so much pressure that you're
covering<00:07:12.229> every<00:07:13.229> square<00:07:13.289> centimeter<00:07:14.280> of<00:07:14.580> your

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
covering every square centimeter of your

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.490 
covering every square centimeter of your
of<00:07:14.970> your<00:07:15.509> tree<00:07:16.009> okay<00:07:17.009> we're<00:07:17.669> just<00:07:17.699> now<00:07:18.500> again

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 
of your tree okay we're just now again

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.719 
of your tree okay we're just now again
this<00:07:20.130> is<00:07:20.190> just<00:07:21.180> to<00:07:21.360> get<00:07:21.509> us<00:07:21.659> started<00:07:22.550> just<00:07:23.550> to

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:23.729 
this is just to get us started just to

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.240 
this is just to get us started just to
get<00:07:23.879> us<00:07:24.030> started<00:07:24.150> so<00:07:24.629> think<00:07:25.379> in<00:07:25.530> terms<00:07:25.830> of<00:07:26.099> the

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
get us started so think in terms of the

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:35.920 
get us started so think in terms of the
diagonals

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.460 

instead<00:07:36.830> of<00:07:37.210> vertical<00:07:38.210> or<00:07:38.419> horizontal<00:07:38.470> arms

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
instead of vertical or horizontal arms

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:50.910 
instead of vertical or horizontal arms
and<00:07:39.680> legs<00:07:40.570> all<00:07:41.570> right<00:07:41.630> so<00:07:42.440> go<00:07:42.680> to<00:07:42.740> work

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:50.920 

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.980 

you
