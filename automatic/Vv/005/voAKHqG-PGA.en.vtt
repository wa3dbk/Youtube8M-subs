00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 the president said that the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 subsidy for liquefied petroleum gas that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.760
 in 2013 it reached 522 million 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
 dollars according to the central bank would be 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.630
 retired from 2016 when 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.250
 the new plants will start to operate 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 hydroelectric plants such as coca 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 elbow-sinclair the plan is that the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.340
 population use electricity as 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 source of energy for cooking which 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 will be accompanied by a campaign to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.820
 change 3 million gas cookers 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 electric induction manufactured in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.599
 country however there are effects 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.369
 collateral of the measure with we had a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 dialogue with an expert in electricity 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.969
 that tells us that the problem lies 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 in the fall of the system network 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.430
 electric at the country level we explain 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.430
 how 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.230
 Then you have to pay for it 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.800
 gold 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.800
 what do you have to do 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.410
 then 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.000
 each one of these 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.300
 you need a circle 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 they fear that amps of two poles 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.990
 here I have space 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.550
 where do I put it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:17.330
 do not 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:19.340
 then I know that this in a home 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.760
 normally enter a certain amount of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.680
 energy we talk about 110 or 220 volts of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.420
 according to the country and the device, this is the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.580
 case of Ecuador so that you cook 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.430
 come into operation you need a 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.170
 voltage of 220 also consider that the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.170
 outlet should also change to 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.170
 220 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.130
 do not connect the light 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 and what to say about the instruments of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 kitchen normally uses pots of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.940
 aluminum and other implements of this 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 material with induction heaters 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.780
 must acquire only steel slabs 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.200
 ferrous that finds them in the market 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.159
 from 50 dollars to know that it works 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.619
 have to put a magnet 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.600
 if the magnet does not grab him this is not what 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 work I'm going to try this doctor 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.970
 materials 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.520
 it's steel and yet at home you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.650
 has an extra load of wilson amps 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.360
 morillo using the multimeter showed 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.520
 how to increase this number when 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.520
 light the stove with a single burner 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.430
 this is the temperature 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 since I bought 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.000
 here in the equator 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.469
 one 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.079
 never 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.209
 but the problem is not only at home 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.920
 and in the extra expenses the network system 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.650
 of electric power when homes 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.610
 they use the induction cookers 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.260
 it would practically collapse the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.540
 inconvenience originates in the cables 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.489
 Low voltage first point size 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.060
 of the cable that we find today is number 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.409
 4 provides energy for 60 houses 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.269
 approximately if you consider that only 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.790
 half of households use this type of 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.680
 Stoves would generate a total of 320 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.590
 amps capacity that does not cover the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.200
 current system this is base base phase to 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.139
 times that comes from the transformer the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.519
 problem is here when you connect 20 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:21.290
 houses only 8 amps are 160 resolution 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.940
 modify the entire network system 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.040
 implementing transformers that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.250
 feed energy to a certain number of 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.819
 homes then here we put a 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 transformer and this transformer 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:38.060
 we feed a number x of houses 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.519
 another transformer comes another number x 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.769
