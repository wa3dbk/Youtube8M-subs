00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello we the people show you today 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.460
 an autumnal bread and that with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 Many choices would have to be quite simple 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:21.000
 recipe is really good 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:21.510
 imitate what do we need ingredients 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.720
 for this 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.480
 we have rye flour and two wheat flour 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.849
 third wheat a triple rye 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.489
 walnuts a lot then bread spice that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.520
 is coriander and could do both 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.300
 dried and ground my garden 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.160
 For this I have dried yeast first 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 some salt butter milk and apple vinegar 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.510
 through the mother's milk apple cider 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.910
 simulates in principle the sourdough 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 tastes very similar and has 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 to produce a critic 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 ok first we have to yeast and heard 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.399
 To be under exact recipe is then again 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.399
 the infobox 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:34.079
 then we form a multi the lukewarm 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 butter munchen a choice must either 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.390
 all you can on a bit 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.390
 button so we make it smaller with it 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:55.409
 of course, in the clover it does 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:59.549
 is always three times as manual strong 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.319
 through working high and one over 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.310
 half an hour to go first that makes yes 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.299
 outside too cold we had a war 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.310
 the per day for a good half hour well 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:16.230
 now more than once sticks right 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 however, that means the work surface 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.829
 all mail in hands too 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.840
 important so not everything when sticking 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:31.650
 remains plentiful looking forward to it 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.850
 and then knead vigorously is thus 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.850
 the car of a bread 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.410
 want to be a bit practiced but 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.920
 only a few times did it work there 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.920
 that's pretty good 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.360
 watch now shows the times even aware 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.220
 Tailors once in and see how 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.990
 the dough is processed you have to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.580
 I do not want to do it now 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.530
 show looks great 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.990
 so he should be very homogeneous 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.990
 we have to knead that 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 It 'll be right on the baking tray 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.860
 then up and over again 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.610
 to rest for at least half an hour 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.340
 like an hour 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:42.880
 the boat now has a good hour so 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.880
 it looks like use the 1 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.239
 Now it's time for ten minutes 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.599
 at 230 degrees in the oven 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.489
 then we put down to 180 degrees 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.950
 Add peel of water as below 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.230
 purely holding oven lassens total 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
 bake for another 50 minutes at 180 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.310
 degree whereby we are the last ten minutes 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 bring the wasserthal so beautiful 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.419
 you can handle it again 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.810
 paint each part with water 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.580
 Pure jobs do not need to do that 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.510
 That's how I define a perfect birth 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.180
 absolutely rustic cross will be great 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.680
 baked by 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.729
 I believe that this industry is this 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.690
 posse it's just divine ne bomb 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:42.680
 transavia.com cut on it 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.180
 actually much too warm for that though 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 I knew too well we write yes 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
 It always shows you want it from the inside 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.840
 Looks like it is great and despite it 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.199
 running a jam playlist to 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.199
 arriving so must be good
