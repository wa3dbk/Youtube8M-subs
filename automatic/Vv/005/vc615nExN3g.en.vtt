00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
in the front here I replace the two that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
in the front here I replace the two that
were<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> front<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> LEDs<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.510> very

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
were in the front the LEDs are very

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
were in the front the LEDs are very
subtle<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.850> there's<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.090> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
subtle and I like that there's just I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.090 
subtle and I like that there's just I
didn't<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.380> bright<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.829> were<00:00:37.980> going

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
didn't know how bright these were going

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.940 
didn't know how bright these were going
to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.239> kind<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> black<00:00:40.620> look

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to be and I kind of like the black look

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
to be and I kind of like the black look
of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> front<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.520> my<00:00:41.579> case<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.770> kind<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of the front of my case so I kind of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.729 
of the front of my case so I kind of
like<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.059> there's<00:00:45.059> only<00:00:45.149> four<00:00:45.960> LEDs<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.649> each

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
like that there's only four LEDs in each

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.540 
like that there's only four LEDs in each
corner<00:00:47.450> rather<00:00:48.450> than<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> entire<00:00:49.079> fan

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
corner rather than the entire fan

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
corner rather than the entire fan
lighting<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> that's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
lighting up and I like that so that's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.459 
lighting up and I like that so that's
very<00:00:53.219> cool<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.239> replaced<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.899> two<00:00:55.199> fans

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
very cool I just replaced the two fans

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
very cool I just replaced the two fans
that<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.480> fans<00:00:57.750> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
original corsair one hundred forty

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.310 
original corsair one hundred forty
millimeter<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
millimeter right there and then I have a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
millimeter right there and then I have a
120-millimeter<00:01:10.320> fan<00:01:10.830> i<00:01:10.860> added<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.580> built

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
120-millimeter fan i added when I built

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
120-millimeter fan i added when I built
the<00:01:11.970> system<00:01:12.260> so<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.549> two<00:01:14.760> are

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the system so these are these two are

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.499 
the system so these are these two are
acting<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.330> exhaust<00:01:16.400> yeah<00:01:17.400> okay<00:01:17.729> these<00:01:18.299> two

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
acting as exhaust yeah okay these two

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
acting as exhaust yeah okay these two
are<00:01:18.540> act<00:01:18.780> against<00:01:19.080> exhaust<00:01:19.470> fans<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.490> there

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
are act against exhaust fans so there

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
are act against exhaust fans so there
you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.479> pulling<00:01:21.780> air<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you know pulling air from up here and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
you know pulling air from up here and
then<00:01:23.189> exhausting<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.380> i

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
then exhausting it and so is this so i

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.359 
then exhausting it and so is this so i
have<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.860> exhaust<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.790> intake<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.369> yeah

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
have three exhaust into intake so yeah

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.990 
have three exhaust into intake so yeah
you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.119> that's<00:01:30.420> fine<00:01:31.700> these<00:01:32.700> fans

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you know I think that's fine these fans

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.260 
you know I think that's fine these fans
are<00:01:33.360> antec<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.229> cool<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> means<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:36.150> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
are antec to cool so that means they are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.710 
are antec to cool so that means they are
to<00:01:36.450> speed<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:38.030> let<00:01:39.030> me<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> my<00:01:39.360> flashlight<00:01:40.490> now

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
to speed so let me get my flashlight now

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
to speed so let me get my flashlight now
that<00:01:42.720> means<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.170> course<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> fan

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that means of course that there is a fan

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.260 
that means of course that there is a fan
switch<00:01:45.259> there<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> controller<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.549> that's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
switch there like a controller so that's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.380 
switch there like a controller so that's
it<00:01:48.390> precisely<00:01:48.600> what<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> took<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:51.060> those

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it precisely what I mean I took to those

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.230 
it precisely what I mean I took to those
two<00:01:51.570> fan<00:01:51.869> controllers<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:53.250> they

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
two fan controllers right there they

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
two fan controllers right there they
would<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:56.939> see

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
would be right there as you can see

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.760 
would be right there as you can see
those<00:01:57.299> two<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.570> boxes<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.439> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
those two little boxes right there and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.300 
those two little boxes right there and
they<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.700> switches<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.360> them

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
they have switches on them

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.340 
they have switches on them
and<00:02:01.430> I<00:02:01.759> just<00:02:01.939> took<00:02:02.149> those<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:02.840> super<00:02:03.229> glued

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
and I just took those and I super glued

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.039 
and I just took those and I super glued
them<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.700> front<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> case<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.630> they're

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
them to the front of the case so they're

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.539 
them to the front of the case so they're
just<00:02:06.259> super<00:02:06.409> glued<00:02:06.710> one<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.040> top<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.399> other

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
just super glued one on top of the other

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.380 
just super glued one on top of the other
right<00:02:07.820> here<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:09.259> think<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.789> fans<00:02:11.030> switch

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
right here and I think the fans switch

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.199 
right here and I think the fans switch
between<00:02:11.599> I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:13.160> like<00:02:13.280> nine<00:02:13.459> hundred<00:02:13.520> rpm

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
between I think like nine hundred rpm

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.720 
between I think like nine hundred rpm
and<00:02:14.239> 1500<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.230> have<00:02:15.739> them<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:15.950> high<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.430> course

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and 1500 I have them on high of course

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.089 
and 1500 I have them on high of course
but<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> turn<00:02:17.959> them<00:02:18.230> down<00:02:18.260> they'll

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
but if you turn them down they'll

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.190 
but if you turn them down they'll
they'll<00:02:19.459> slow<00:02:19.700> down<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.599> I<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.989> them<00:02:21.080> on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
they'll slow down but I have them on

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.160 
they'll slow down but I have them on
high<00:02:21.410> because<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.250> don't<00:02:22.519> really<00:02:22.610> care<00:02:23.170> this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
high because I don't really care this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.680 
high because I don't really care this
computer<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.650> not<00:02:24.860> loud<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:26.180> want<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> most

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
computer is not loud and I want the most

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.720 
computer is not loud and I want the most
airflow<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.230> can<00:02:27.560> get<00:02:27.739> without<00:02:27.890> being<00:02:28.280> too<00:02:28.519> loud

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
airflow I can get without being too loud

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.020 
airflow I can get without being too loud
so<00:02:29.120> just<00:02:30.019> have<00:02:30.110> them<00:02:30.260> both<00:02:30.349> on<00:02:30.410> high<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.670> they

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
so just have them both on high so they

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.949 
so just have them both on high so they
move<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.569> lot<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.810> air<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.410> mean<00:02:33.709> heard<00:02:34.780> they<00:02:35.780> move

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
move a lot of air I mean heard they move

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.800 
move a lot of air I mean heard they move
a<00:02:35.989> lot<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.410> air<00:02:36.680> than<00:02:36.709> these<00:02:37.100> fans<00:02:37.370> did<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:38.600> in

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
a lot more air than these fans did be in

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.500 
a lot more air than these fans did be in
the<00:02:38.900> front<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:39.410> i<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.519> there's<00:02:41.239> two<00:02:41.330> of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the front so i just have there's two of

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.850 
the front so i just have there's two of
them<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:41.959> one<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.290> top<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.590> other<00:02:42.680> of

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
them so one on top of the other of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.140 
them so one on top of the other of
course<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:44.680> ones<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:45.920> moving<00:02:46.340> air<00:02:46.519> taking

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
course and ones just moving air taking

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.729 
course and ones just moving air taking
intake<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.049> other<00:02:48.080> one<00:02:48.349> is<00:02:48.380> also

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
intake and then the other one is also

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.070 
intake and then the other one is also
intake<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.880> it's<00:02:50.030> moving<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.450> over<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.870> hard

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
intake but it's moving it over the hard

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.020 
intake but it's moving it over the hard
drives<00:02:51.349> which<00:02:51.590> would<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:51.890> my<00:02:52.069> course

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
drives which would be my course

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.000 
drives which would be my course
interesti<00:02:53.780> which<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.200> right<00:02:54.349> there<00:02:54.410> than<00:02:54.830> my

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
interesti which is right there than my

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.789 
interesti which is right there than my
seagate<00:02:55.910> 500<00:02:56.480> gig<00:02:56.569> hard<00:02:56.599> drive<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.620> it's

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
seagate 500 gig hard drive so it's

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.430 
seagate 500 gig hard drive so it's
blowing<00:02:58.040> pretty<00:02:58.420> pretty<00:02:59.420> good<00:02:59.630> air<00:02:59.900> over

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
blowing pretty pretty good air over

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.990 
blowing pretty pretty good air over
those<00:03:00.590> hard<00:03:00.830> drives<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.880> that's<00:03:02.060> cool<00:03:04.000> yeah

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
those hard drives so that's cool yeah

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.740 
those hard drives so that's cool yeah
like<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.299> showed<00:03:05.480> before<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:07.000> corsair<00:03:08.000> 140

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
like I showed before the corsair 140

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.970 
like I showed before the corsair 140
right<00:03:08.870> there<00:03:09.310> 120<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.489> was<00:03:10.760> resist<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.959> yeah<00:03:12.709> I

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
right there 120 I was resist so yeah I

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.759 
right there 120 I was resist so yeah I
think<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.760> worked<00:03:13.940> out<00:03:14.060> pretty<00:03:14.239> well<00:03:14.769> there

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
think it worked out pretty well there

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.410 
think it worked out pretty well there
was<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.890> quite<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.220> few<00:03:16.459> cables<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.910> hook<00:03:16.940> up<00:03:17.209> back

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
was a quite a few cables to hook up back

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.960 
was a quite a few cables to hook up back
there<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.840> rather<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.769> mess<00:03:19.100> behind<00:03:19.370> behind

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
there it's rather a mess behind behind

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.500 
there it's rather a mess behind behind
this<00:03:20.299> trade<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:22.519> can't<00:03:22.760> really<00:03:22.790> see<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.359> so

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
this trade so you can't really see it so

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.110 
this trade so you can't really see it so
that's<00:03:23.690> good<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.799> mean<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.850> see<00:03:26.090> I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
that's good but I mean you can see I

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.059 
that's good but I mean you can see I
just<00:03:26.569> had<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.930> stuff<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> cables<00:03:27.769> in<00:03:27.920> there

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
just had to stuff the cables in there

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.410 
just had to stuff the cables in there
and<00:03:28.250> there<00:03:28.370> wasn't<00:03:28.549> really<00:03:28.760> much<00:03:28.880> I<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.180> do

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and there wasn't really much I can do

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.190 
and there wasn't really much I can do
about<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.980> has<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.579> stay<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:31.910> that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
about that so it has to stay like that

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.190 
about that so it has to stay like that
so<00:03:33.200> yeah<00:03:33.350> um<00:03:33.829> that's<00:03:34.000> basically<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.239> my

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
so yeah um that's basically that my

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.580 
so yeah um that's basically that my
computer<00:03:36.380> is<00:03:36.889> now<00:03:37.400> has<00:03:37.670> five<00:03:38.299> fans<00:03:38.750> in<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.139> so<00:03:39.380> i

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
computer is now has five fans in it so i

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.430 
computer is now has five fans in it so i
think<00:03:39.920> i'm<00:03:40.160> good<00:03:40.340> with<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.959> supports<00:03:42.350> up

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
think i'm good with that it supports up

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.809 
think i'm good with that it supports up
to<00:03:42.470> seven<00:03:42.859> i<00:03:43.010> could<00:03:43.190> put<00:03:43.370> two<00:03:43.489> more<00:03:43.670> on<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
to seven i could put two more on the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.309 
to seven i could put two more on the
side<00:03:44.359> panel<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:44.840> i'm<00:03:44.900> not<00:03:44.989> going<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.290> that

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
side panel but i'm not going to do that

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.860 
side panel but i'm not going to do that
so<00:03:45.680> I<00:03:45.859> think<00:03:46.790> my<00:03:46.910> temp<00:03:47.180> should<00:03:47.359> be<00:03:47.510> somewhat

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
so I think my temp should be somewhat

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.120 
so I think my temp should be somewhat
improved<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:49.239> yeah<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:51.500> I'd<00:03:51.799> like<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:52.040> thank

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
improved and yeah so I'd like to thank

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.740 
improved and yeah so I'd like to thank
