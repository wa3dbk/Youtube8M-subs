 I will play the actual game while mixing this pattern with 1 minute now . 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.889

 I'm moving and catching your fingertips . 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:37.360
 If you do too much, you will get blisters now and you will be sick for a long time. 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:41.920
 So I can not do what one knows this more than just playing by touching the fluffy little animals 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.290
 You gave it to me and then you did it again. 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.320
 I like to catch it more slowly . 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.080
 It's just getting sunny all at once. 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.250
 If you catch a blister, you have to have some more food. 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.960
 It's hurting, and the girls are now eating it. 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.640
