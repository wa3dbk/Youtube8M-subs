00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.939
 hello today show us the elements of a hive 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.320
 for a start you have acquired a heightened clarified especially not at the 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.480
 ground for the summer 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.460
 art after you have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.519
 floor 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 here a completely adhered floor to give air to the bees and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.800
 kumite then vented 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.570
 ap 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.230
 after the body well 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.900
 so a body of hives 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.210
 this is where the bees live all year round it agrees rudy dates 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 in frames where there may be a bit of a frame 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.890
 here 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.860
 make up the body on the hive 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.020
 but then covers it 40 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.400
 which allows sorry it's a violation with respect to the heat and 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 cold green 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.960
 and so untouchable 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.980
 so here is your I made up 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.740
 where the bees sold in the body 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.550
 all year round various 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.299
 others must and protected% at the entrance 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.450
 to find the doors 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.190
 this is a title door om space is small or friends of 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 bees can go through the ordeal you simply have to kipÃ© 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 the door 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.950
 on the page we compose 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.080
 the door 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 from October to March 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.220
 to prevent all rodents and all media talk about getting into the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.010
 stuffy 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.480
 and in the month of April we must ask Kenyan sports forces same operation 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 we remove the roof 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.410
 we raise the rise 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.640
 directly 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.260
 on the hive 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.600
 so if we rest the frame cover 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.330
 and the roof 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.180
 so there you have bees that live year round the body of hives 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.490
 alas the rose where the bees is a little better 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.340
 at the time of harvest in urban agriculture that is done towards end 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.480
 July-early August 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 can not 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.999
 an airlock and that's it 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.729
 it's simply 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.769
 a portico 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.390
 which allows December bees to rise to the body without power 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.529
 ride up 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.229
 so 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.889
 end of june it is a late July-early August we remove the roof again 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.069
 it covers 40 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.689
 you raise the rise 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.219
 and you slide in front of blake between their rise and the corner 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.969
 Yes 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.969
 we close 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.799
 we do that one night 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.550
 so there at night the bees of the rise 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.550
 are going down to the body found the queen and the convent 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:47.719
 the next morning 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.779
 you come 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:50.599
 you remove the roof again 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.439
 and there you have 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.689
 a rose 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.340
 full of honey is completely empty of bees you remove it wanting from the 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.339
 town hall but express pekin 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.509
 you take off 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.049
 the bees lock 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.049
 and you close your opinion 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.719
 in september during your visit 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.559
 in wintering it is necessary to control the weight of your age your knee the russian 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.500
 like that gives in 10 cases must do about fifty pounds 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.830
 if it is less than 7 and less than 40 kilos 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.110
 you have to feed the bees so that she can pass the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.569
 misery 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.859
 we remove the roof covers 40 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.899
 and we install a sister or a horizon is simply a container 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.329
 we will put sugar syrup 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.829
 to be able% and that bees come without drowning and so on 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.609
 feed and descendants the syrup in the hive 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.189
 and be able to pass 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.120
 the glasses without any problem we compose the bad spell covers 4 on the 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.849
 hive orme sugar syrup here with my power come without any worry with the 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.120
 syrup turns it into English and store it in the hive for attacking mills and 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.020
 the minimum forty to fifty kilos to be able to spend a winter 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.379
 without any problem 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.379
 and you close 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.159
 for beginners agriculture in its equipment then its protection of 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.159
 bees in the vicinity for 250 to 400 euros 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.969
 following the spring with the release of my book and all the videos 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:26.250
 practices of urban agriculture
