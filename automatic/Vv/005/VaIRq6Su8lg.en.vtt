 There is a lot of regulation and photography.

 should be those extremely pictures 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.680
 treated so that leaves a lot off 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.110
 from the real he 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.130
 We want to make this contest. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.170
 so that people learn the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.969
 take photographs before doing any other 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.149

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:16.340
 photographic base a disc and with this 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.740
 Our new juror here is a jury. 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.750
 quite important here in the middle 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.310
 photographic one is from amateur photography 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.960
 that a work 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.579
 the other paulo moreira that is from the area 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.429
 professional stock photos and images 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:32.509
 of photography for trade 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.149
 advertisements and the like who are the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.890
 image banks and the other is the 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.799
 scientific photograph that the teacher 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.109
 doctor of god who is specialized and 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.909
 micro photography and is one of the largest 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.740
 Teachers here in Brazil, right? 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.630
 these three jurors here will be very 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.069
 important for us here for us to be able 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 grow in photography for us 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.560
 learning to participate even in these 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.380
 tend to learn to identify the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.020
 subject of the invitation to tender 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.719
 understand the soul to convey our 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.880
 idea of ​​this theme that we created 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.920
 there it is this contest theme follows 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 and take a picture within that theme 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.670
 we see what we got 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.050
 next or not so this will be 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.690
 important for us and for 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.980
 where to grow even more in photography 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.080
 study hard for the ones who watch the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.630
 videos all over there and get rid of the start 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.069
 until the latter withdrawal and including 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.420
 philosophical also so I have 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.370
 sure you will learn to photograph 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.310
 very well then this first one will be 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.489
 theme and one photo per student can not 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.769
 hdr can not flash can not mount no 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.319
 can this very extreme treatment 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.140
 You need to register at fpf's site 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.569

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.300
 As of today they are from 24 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.500

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.850
 They will send me this list with the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.850
 use of the 1st to 10th of each of them and there 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 they will have a maximum of 30 people there 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.120
 be classified and we will 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.780
 present these photos a hangout 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.790
 on May 4 , 2014, which is a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.320
 Sunday at 8 pm 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.600
 now the most important is that the 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.760
 prize of our contest he will have 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.340
 a symbolic prize just because people 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510
 no condition or the actual cousin right 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.750
 but this award will be very nice 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.209
 I will also do the first three 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.760
 photos of each of the jurors and the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.980
 jurors ended up choosing the same 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.709
 photos so these pictures end up 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.380
 only these do not include other 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.840
 then only a maximum of three photos that will 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.750
 be the first three of each juror will 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.910
 earn a stamp by rating the photo with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.220
 juror, but anyone who takes a way he 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.930
 will have this peck of fpf there and 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.600
 seven other photos that were pacified 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.870
 also they will win a mention stamp 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.900
 honorable of the pf contest and all 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 these 30 photos at most they will stay 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.549
 here on our home page that 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.560
 nothing on the site for the entire next month 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.420
 Until when will I start the other contest? 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.910
 it is when you have a judgment of the other 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.909
 course will change but there will not be the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.489
 whole month exposed here not smoking in the 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.019
 our home page of our fpf website that 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.210
 will help us to decorate here the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.669
 our site and have one more problem too 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.120
 is that within our competition that 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.419
 our administrators of our 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.400
 facebook is connected groups and that dinei 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.860
 I had to leave it open for 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.320
 they also participate because they 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.060
 ended up almost revealing then I had 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.400
 let them participate 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.130
 but I'm going to ask jurors not to 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.180
 look at the names of the photos of the names 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.190
 of the authors 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.789
 in fact not only are both the three 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.260
 here is the milestone for edna and fabrício 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.479
 then the three will have to participate 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.419
 together with you in the contest 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.820
 But I already told the jurors there not to 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.190
 look at the name and see only missing here 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.020
 so this is personal whim in the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.880
 photography is done with the maximum of 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.950
 care you got them 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.930
 that the photo looks quite beautiful from a 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.400
 trading but not very extreme and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.810
 participate in this contest that will be 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.760
 Nice and we'll learn 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.440
 enough then that's it, very personal 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.320
 Thank you, not you, did you like it? 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.130
