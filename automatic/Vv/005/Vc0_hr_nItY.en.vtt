00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
did not really think that the investment

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.300 
did not really think that the investment
in<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.930> toothbrush<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:36.920> one<00:01:37.070> here<00:01:37.220> this

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
didn't think that it would be worth the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.630 
didn't think that it would be worth the
money<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.050> this<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.170> them<00:01:42.440> mmm<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.370> the

spectrum of money you can spend this is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.820 
spectrum of money you can spend this is
one<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.160> lesser<00:01:47.000> expensive<00:01:47.510> ones<00:01:47.900> for<00:01:48.770> the

one of the lesser expensive ones for the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.530 
one of the lesser expensive ones for the
longest<00:01:49.160> time<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.550> thought<00:01:49.700> nah<00:01:49.940> this<00:01:50.180> is<00:01:50.330> just

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
longest time I thought nah this is just

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
real quick and why this should really be

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.539 
real quick and why this should really be
something<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.930> consider<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:38.129> Sonicare

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
something that you consider the Sonicare

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.150 
something that you consider the Sonicare
for<00:02:38.760> instance<00:02:39.060> um<00:02:39.239> if<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.450> guys<00:02:39.569> can<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:39.900> this

the Sonicare masonic area moves really

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.080 
the Sonicare masonic area moves really
really<00:02:46.950> fast<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.549> can<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.849> by<00:02:48.030> its

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
really fast as you can see by its

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.059 
really fast as you can see by its
shedding<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> extra<00:02:49.379> water<00:02:49.590> that

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
shedding all of the extra water that

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.800 
shedding all of the extra water that
should<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.879> an<00:02:50.970> outtake<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.510> I'm<00:02:51.599> totally

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
should be an outtake but I'm totally
