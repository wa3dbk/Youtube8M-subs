00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.420
 to put this here first of all it's worth 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.659
 what I'm seeing here the most 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.450
 important are these things this is what 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.860
 most important of all with this I am already 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.899
 happy and father you could always have me 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.939
 sent a box simply with this and 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.229
 I am already very happy 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.450
 well after having removed all these 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.090
 little pieces that have all been there 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.369
 well let's open the box was here 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.310
 in mysterious as not and then a 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.750
 very special person and does not open it with a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.610
 knife is worth it opens with a 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.950
 screwdriver because I am a person 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.970
 very special so look 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 Look, look, look, look up, and have a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.280
 very special person and open things 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.459
 with 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.680
 or more of those things 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.220
 but why else am I going to have to remove 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.110
 my god please send the lots 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 I would practice ergo inside some caps 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.520
 a crash looks at a rolling sign 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.520
 and always see in the background 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.810
 over here and good here is a small 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.950
 rate that I think you do not have anything else 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:54.100
 inside a small house the truth 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.090
 I do not know how it is that a small 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.379
 Cup of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.340
 lol this I think it refers to the 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.530
 good expansions 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.190
 has the dance with infinity of then 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.849
 is the one left that is go me with 982 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.650
 so I think this makes it a 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.799
 small reference to the two expansions 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.260
 not that you have several infinite not that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.849
 they travel to a rapture and I think it makes a 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.940
 small reference and the truth that good 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.010
 is really beautiful ball very much 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.170
 us but it makes me more old themes 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.360
 of is inside out 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.040
 the truth that it's cool a lot is very 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.710
 pretty all the time is very sexy and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.630
 pretty everything is worth here in the background 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.810
 brings a small eagle t - shirt 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.950
 already if you 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.690
 you understand a little here if you want 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.520
 with the eagle you will know what game 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.800
 refer 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.300
 and good and you have to do it more or 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.210
 less an idea 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.900
 of what is and 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.270
 an eagle is worth an eagle is the eagle 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.340
 Assassin's Creed is not already 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.340
 watching over here I already said it's from 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.340
 this country is worth and also of assassins 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.330
 creed little things brings a poster worth brings 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.100
 another poster of the bay 8 is worth the 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.290
 tender I do not know who this is to see good 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.820
 a bomb and this is the bird not the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.300
 bird of the 8 that I did not remember myself 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.739
 as it was called vale and also brings another 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.180
 little thing around here I'm fine there's a 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.200
 thing in the background that now I'm going to 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.420
 teach that you will like it very much 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.980
 but also later when the 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.690
 dismiss I'm going to put the whole fund to 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.480
 that you can see it good this makes a 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.790
 difference to bayern 81 and 82 and to the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.290
 expansion of infinity that I do not know if 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.730
 you remember that in the go I eat 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.800
 he announced with a rabbit mask that is 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.090
 costume party is not 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.630
 basically good by detection and nothing 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.730
 more and the truth is very cool is with 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.400
 a pretty good paper not the role of 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:52.050
 cartoon style and cool a lot and here it brings 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:56.040
 and here brings my damn saga last 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.440
 preferred a poster worth I suppose it is 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.990
 colour 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.030
 yes I think it's color that has the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.820
 Fashion very much 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.170
 and he's already very handsome uncle is very handsome 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.310
 this goes directly to the variable 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.780
 because I have a wall that is 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.090
 totally empty and I'm going to start 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.800
 hang everything and here I bring what to 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.040
 you look more or less is going to 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.780
 come well what is 15% worth it with 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.740
 15% 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.200
 Take a shirt with 15% with the 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.160
 Hays code is worth it if you put it that believes in 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.260
 the toaster 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.760
 this good I just found out but this 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.650
 for you I do not want it at all 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.260
 so all you have to do is 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.290
 this with the height crate code is valid and 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.900
 you have a 15 percent discount as well 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.330
 I really enjoy all this 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.610
 Well, nothing girls are watching here
