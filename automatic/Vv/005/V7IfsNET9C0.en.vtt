00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
matter of fact and the best way that I

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.140 
matter of fact and the best way that I
can<00:00:54.140> describe<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.980> Thistle<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.610> it<00:00:55.790> tastes<00:00:56.089> a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
can describe the Thistle is it tastes a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.259 
can describe the Thistle is it tastes a
lot<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.449> an<00:00:56.839> artichoke<00:00:57.699> actually<00:00:58.699> very<00:00:58.970> very

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
lot like an artichoke actually very very

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.750 
lot like an artichoke actually very very
similar<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.809> one<00:01:00.110> but<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.949> also<00:01:01.129> want<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.550> be

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
similar to one but you also want to be

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.729 
similar to one but you also want to be
very<00:01:02.000> careful<00:01:02.629> with<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.170> thistle<00:01:03.589> and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
very careful with the thistle and

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.910 
very careful with the thistle and
consume<00:01:04.250> very<00:01:04.729> small<00:01:05.210> amounts<00:01:05.840> because<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
consume very small amounts because it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.609 
consume very small amounts because it
has<00:01:07.090> carcinogenic<00:01:08.090> alkaloids<00:01:08.689> that<00:01:08.990> are

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
has carcinogenic alkaloids that are

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.620 
has carcinogenic alkaloids that are
cancer-causing<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:10.850> once<00:01:11.090> again<00:01:11.240> be

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
cancer-causing so once again be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.530 
cancer-causing so once again be
extremely<00:01:12.590> careful<00:01:13.070> with<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.460> plant<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.000> I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
extremely careful with this plant and I

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.469 
extremely careful with this plant and I
recommend<00:01:15.140> only<00:01:15.409> harvesting<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.400> very<00:01:17.060> small

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
recommend only harvesting a very small

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.990 
recommend only harvesting a very small
amount<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.020> mixing<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.650> with<00:01:18.770> other<00:01:19.010> foods<00:01:19.369> so

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
amount and mixing it with other foods so

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.179 
amount and mixing it with other foods so
that<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.510> thistle<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.140> like<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.830> said<00:01:22.009> this

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
that is the thistle and like I said this

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.910 
that is the thistle and like I said this
grows<00:01:22.430> wild<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.150> lot<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.479> places<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:23.990> very

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
grows wild in a lot of places so very

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.190 
grows wild in a lot of places so very
useful<00:01:25.189> plant<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.420> also<00:01:26.600> can<00:01:26.990> be<00:01:27.020> very

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
useful plant but also can be very

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:37.450 
useful plant but also can be very
dangerous<00:01:35.499> all<00:01:36.499> right<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.859> I<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:36.950> showed<00:01:37.429> you

thistle in my opinion tea and that is a
stock<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.740> grows<00:01:49.429> right<00:01:49.759> in<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.090> center<00:01:50.479> and
