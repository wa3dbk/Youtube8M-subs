need two a's and 2 b's by the end of the
semester<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.440> minimum<00:02:13.100> do<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.460> think

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
semester for the minimum do you think

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.490 
semester for the minimum do you think
you<00:02:13.760> can<00:02:13.910> pull<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.150> out<00:02:14.210> no<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> don't<00:02:15.470> think

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you can pull that out no I don't think

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.770 
you can pull that out no I don't think
so<00:02:15.710> at<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.130> stage<00:02:16.400> yeah<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.240> mean<00:02:17.600> that's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
so at this stage yeah I mean that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.880 
so at this stage yeah I mean that's
really<00:02:17.990> understandable<00:02:18.620> given<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
really understandable given the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.080 
really understandable given the
situation's<00:02:19.520> you've<00:02:19.670> been<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.030> through

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
situation's you've been going through

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
situation's you've been going through
but<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> great<00:02:21.320> opportunity<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:22.070> want

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
but this is a great opportunity you want

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.660 
but this is a great opportunity you want
this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
this

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.070 
this
hopefully<00:02:23.150> temporary<00:02:23.480> situation<00:02:23.959> your

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
hopefully temporary situation your

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.860 
hopefully temporary situation your
father<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.650> affect<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.510> sometimes<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:26.660> terms

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
father to affect that sometimes in terms

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.480 
father to affect that sometimes in terms
of<00:02:27.020> fitness<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.620> more<00:02:27.890> important<00:02:28.370> than

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
of fitness can be more important than

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.210 
of fitness can be more important than
your<00:02:28.880> final<00:02:29.300> major<00:02:29.450> or<00:02:29.930> even<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.680> I'm<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.830> GPA

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
your final major or even if I'm a GPA

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.070 
your final major or even if I'm a GPA
because<00:02:31.490> they<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.790> open<00:02:32.270> up<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.630> many<00:02:32.750> doors

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
because they can open up so many doors

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750 
because they can open up so many doors
so<00:02:33.830> you're<00:02:33.950> really<00:02:34.070> gonna<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.430> push<00:02:34.730> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
so you're really gonna have to push to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.120 
so you're really gonna have to push to
make<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:36.200> try<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.650> exception<00:02:36.920> of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
make this to try to get an exception of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.180

you could go online to the website that
deals<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.720> internship<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.530> see<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:51.980> they're

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
willing to make a deferment so basically

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.290 
willing to make a deferment so basically
if<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:53.989> could<00:02:54.170> defer<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:54.680> until<00:02:55.300> another

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
if you could defer this until another

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.640 
if you could defer this until another
semester<00:02:56.480> where<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:56.930> GPA<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.380> good

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
semester where your GPA is a good

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.380 
semester where your GPA is a good
standing<00:02:58.130> maybe<00:02:58.489> they'll<00:02:58.670> agree<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.120> or

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
standing maybe they'll agree to that or

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.330 
standing maybe they'll agree to that or
perhaps<00:02:59.810> even<00:03:00.110> maybe<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.650> could<00:03:00.830> ask<00:03:00.980> them<00:03:01.220> if

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
perhaps even maybe you could ask them if

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.150 
perhaps even maybe you could ask them if
they<00:03:01.459> would<00:03:01.870> waive<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:03.200> requirement<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.769> GPA

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
they would waive the requirement of GPA

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.520 
they would waive the requirement of GPA
based<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:04.670> your<00:03:04.790> situation<00:03:06.040> okay

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
based on your situation okay

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.030 
based on your situation okay
you<00:03:09.280> do<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.610> okay<00:03:10.120> good<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.569> basically<00:03:11.040> you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you do that okay good so basically you

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.890 
you do that okay good so basically you
need<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.400> network<00:03:12.760> on<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.330> check

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
need to the network on this so check

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.960 
need to the network on this so check
with<00:03:13.930> Disney<00:03:14.410> first<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.770> all<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.819> then
