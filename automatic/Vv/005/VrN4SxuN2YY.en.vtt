fingerpicking so enjoyed of
finger-picking<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.170> if<00:00:10.320> your<00:00:10.469> guitar<00:00:10.769> player

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
finger-picking so if your guitar player

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.190 
finger-picking so if your guitar player
you<00:00:11.370> already<00:00:11.670> know<00:00:11.910> about<00:00:12.059> playing<00:00:12.690> chords

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
you already know about playing chords

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.710 
you already know about playing chords
right<00:00:14.210> like<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.389> example<00:00:15.420> C<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> minor

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 

and<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> produce<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.550> kind<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
and you're going to produce one kind of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.650 
and you're going to produce one kind of
sound<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:24.720> strumming<00:00:25.349> right

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
sound just by strumming right

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.930 
sound just by strumming right
you<00:00:27.350> strum<00:00:27.830> different<00:00:28.160> patterns<00:00:28.580> you<00:00:28.820> know

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
you strum different patterns you know

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:37.480 
you strum different patterns you know
but<00:00:29.090> it's<00:00:29.210> still<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:30.020> same<00:00:30.050> chord<00:00:30.560> you<00:00:30.740> know

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.880 

so<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:38.690> finger<00:00:39.080> picking<00:00:39.320> we're<00:00:39.740> basically

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
so with finger picking we're basically

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:48.550 
so with finger picking we're basically
playing<00:00:40.520> one<00:00:40.880> note<00:00:40.910> at<00:00:41.060> a<00:00:41.210> time

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:01:02.869 

very<00:00:49.190> different<00:00:49.400> sound<00:00:49.760> right

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.530 

so<00:01:03.879> there's<00:01:04.720> no<00:01:05.080> right<00:01:05.950> or<00:01:05.979> wrong<00:01:06.280> way<00:01:06.549> to<00:01:06.580> do

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
so there's no right or wrong way to do

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.990 
so there's no right or wrong way to do
fingerpicking<00:01:08.320> or<00:01:08.680> any<00:01:08.830> aspect<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:09.670> guitar

ring finger on the B string so real

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.160 
ring finger on the B string so real
simple<00:01:46.310> like<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.580> first<00:01:46.790> exercise<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.960> just

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
simple like the first exercise you just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.600 
simple like the first exercise you just
do<00:01:48.320> like<00:01:48.500> one<00:01:48.950> two<00:01:49.580> three<00:01:50.270> four<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:52.130> get<00:01:52.400> its

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
do like one two three four to get its

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
do like one two three four to get its
thumb<00:01:52.910> first<00:01:53.450> middle<00:01:54.200> ring

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
thumb first middle ring

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
thumb first middle ring
and<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.630> for<00:01:58.020> example<00:01:58.079> repeat

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and you can just like for example repeat

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.620 
and you can just like for example repeat
that<00:01:58.829> twice<00:02:02.899> switch<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.079> an<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.289> minor<00:02:05.630> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
that twice switch to an a minor so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
that twice switch to an a minor so
switching<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.560> left<00:02:07.950> hand<00:02:08.160> but

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
switching here with the left hand but

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.710 
switching here with the left hand but
the<00:02:08.759> right<00:02:08.970> hands<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> same

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the right hands going to the same

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510 
the right hands going to the same
pattern

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
pattern

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.580 
pattern
so<00:02:12.300> yeah

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.869 

now<00:02:17.590> let's<00:02:17.830> move<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.159> whole<00:02:18.370> thing<00:02:18.580> down<00:02:18.819> a

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
now let's move the whole thing down a

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.690 
now let's move the whole thing down a
set<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.330> strings<00:02:19.569> with<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> G<00:02:20.230> chord<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.250> now<00:02:21.430> I'm

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
set of strings with a G chord so now I'm

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.479 
set of strings with a G chord so now I'm
serving<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.269> low<00:02:22.450> E<00:02:22.480> string

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:37.490 

alright<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:29.329> we've<00:02:29.510> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.080 

now<00:02:38.500> let's<00:02:38.710> take<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.160> step<00:02:39.190> farther<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
now let's take that one step farther and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:51.650 
now let's take that one step farther and
do<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.570> pattern

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.390 

so<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.960> what<00:02:53.110> I'm<00:02:53.200> doing<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.890> going<00:02:54.160> up

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
so here what I'm doing is I'm going up

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550 
so here what I'm doing is I'm going up
three

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
three

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.030 
three
but<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:57.340> instead<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.670> going

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
but then instead of going

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
but then instead of going
up<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.879> 4th<00:03:00.120> string<00:03:00.360> I'm<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.629> going<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
up to the 4th string I'm just going to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.460 
up to the 4th string I'm just going to
go<00:03:02.090> back<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.450> then<00:03:04.079> up

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.470 

and<00:03:09.470> then<00:03:09.890> down<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.460> back<00:03:10.580> up<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.970> it's<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.240> a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
and then down and back up so it's like a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.240 
and then down and back up so it's like a
string<00:03:12.470> D<00:03:12.950> string<00:03:13.310> D<00:03:13.970> string<00:03:14.420> D<00:03:15.080> string<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:16.010> B

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
string D string D string D string the B

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.960
