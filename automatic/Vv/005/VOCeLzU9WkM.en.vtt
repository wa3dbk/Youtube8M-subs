00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
sure it's a t-shirt you don't want to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.710 
sure it's a t-shirt you don't want to
use<00:01:31.270> again<00:01:31.450> for<00:01:31.810> something<00:01:31.990> else<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.540> what

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
use again for something else so what

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.870 
use again for something else so what
we're<00:01:34.869> going<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> do<00:01:35.200> first<00:01:35.650> is<00:01:36.100> we're<00:01:36.790> going

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
we're going to do first is we're going

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.690 
we're going to do first is we're going
to<00:01:37.000> dilute<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:38.049> water-based<00:01:38.830> poly<00:01:39.159> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
to dilute the water-based poly the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.340 
to dilute the water-based poly the
reason<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.090> do<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.450> because<00:01:40.720> if<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.110> apply

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
reason I do this is because if you apply

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.690 
reason I do this is because if you apply
it<00:01:41.380> straight<00:01:41.619> out<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.369> most<00:01:42.640> likely

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
it straight out of the can most likely

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.950 
it straight out of the can most likely
you're<00:01:43.119> going<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.270> end<00:01:43.390> up<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.630> streaks

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
you're going to end up with streaks

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.960 
you're going to end up with streaks
across<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.350> top<00:01:44.799> at<00:01:45.340> least<00:01:45.580> that's<00:01:45.790> what

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
across the top at least that's what

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630 
across the top at least that's what
happens<00:01:46.900> in<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:47.170> case<00:01:47.470> because<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.400> paint

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
happens in my case because the paint

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.280 
happens in my case because the paint
soaks<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:49.119> up<00:01:49.210> I'm<00:01:49.420> using<00:01:49.570> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
soaks it up I'm using the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.600 
soaks it up I'm using the
yourself<00:01:50.710> chalk<00:01:50.950> paint<00:01:51.220> that's<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.460> my

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
yourself chalk paint that's on my

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.400 
yourself chalk paint that's on my
website<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.180> paint<00:01:52.420> soak<00:01:52.630> steps<00:01:52.990> so<00:01:53.140> fast

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
website and the paint soak steps so fast

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.010 
website and the paint soak steps so fast
that<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.790> dries<00:01:55.060> too<00:01:55.390> fast<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.900> then

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that it then it dries too fast and then

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.680 
that it then it dries too fast and then
you<00:01:56.050> end<00:01:56.260> up<00:01:56.350> with<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> lot<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.860> streaks<00:01:57.250> um<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:58.630> I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
you end up with a lot of streaks um so I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.840 
you end up with a lot of streaks um so I
dilute<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.620> down<00:01:59.650> about<00:01:59.950> 50/50<00:02:00.670> with

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
dilute it down about 50/50 with

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.300 
dilute it down about 50/50 with
polyurethane<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.870> water<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.800> this<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.130> my

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
polyurethane and water so this is my

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.490 
polyurethane and water so this is my
diluted<00:02:03.880> polyurethane<00:02:04.600> actually<00:02:05.380> like

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
diluted polyurethane actually like

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.200 
diluted polyurethane actually like
having<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:05.980> in<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.280> little<00:02:06.550> cup<00:02:06.730> Mormon

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
and I've already done the side so I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.010 
and I've already done the side so I
don't<00:02:26.470> really<00:02:26.800> need<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.400> do<00:02:28.060> too<00:02:28.270> much<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
don't really need to do too much on the

don't really need to do too much on the
side<00:02:29.370> I'm<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:30.790> doing<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.510> top<00:02:31.780> here

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
side I'm just really doing the top here

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.690 
side I'm just really doing the top here
kind<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.040> see<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.800> once<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.190> smooth<00:02:36.490> to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
I'm not standing it to the point where

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.530 
I'm not standing it to the point where
it's<00:02:44.440> getting<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:44.950> dirty<00:02:45.270> but<00:02:46.270> if<00:02:46.390> you

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
it's getting really dirty but if you

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.729 
it's getting really dirty but if you
feel<00:02:46.750> like<00:02:46.780> there's<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> lot<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.530> sandpaper

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
feel like there's a lot of sandpaper

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.060 
feel like there's a lot of sandpaper
definitely<00:02:48.730> or<00:02:49.090> sawdust<00:02:50.489> definitely<00:02:51.489> go<00:02:51.760> get

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
definitely or sawdust definitely go get

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.610 
definitely or sawdust definitely go get
the<00:02:54.070> water<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.700> maybe<00:02:54.970> some<00:02:55.239> mineral<00:02:55.510> spirits

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
the water and maybe some mineral spirits

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.560 
the water and maybe some mineral spirits
and<00:02:56.620> wipe<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.010> down<00:02:57.160> really<00:02:57.430> good<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:58.450> this

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
and wipe it down really good in this

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.780 
and wipe it down really good in this
case<00:02:58.780> I'm<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.070> barely<00:03:00.070> sanding<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:00.730> I'm

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
case I'm just barely sanding it so I'm

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.410 
case I'm just barely sanding it so I'm
not<00:03:00.850> too<00:03:01.060> worried<00:03:01.330> about<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:02.280> um<00:03:03.420> then

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
not too worried about that um then

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you're going to just take a little end

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.440 
you're going to just take a little end
of<00:03:05.920> your<00:03:06.130> cloth<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.940> you're<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.269> just

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
bit you can see that but there's really

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.949 
bit you can see that but there's really
not<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.070> lot<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.459> my<00:03:12.610> club<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.239> you're<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.900> to

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.170 
not a lot on my club and you're going to
work<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.769> just<00:03:15.190> make<00:03:15.760> sure<00:03:16.000> you're

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
work it in and just make sure you're

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.420 
work it in and just make sure you're
going<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> same<00:03:16.930> direction<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.220> want

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
going in the same direction and you want

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.360 
going in the same direction and you want
to<00:03:18.549> keep<00:03:18.790> what<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> would<00:03:19.750> call<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.290> wet<00:03:21.070> edge

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
to keep what I would call a wet edge

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.880 
to keep what I would call a wet edge
which<00:03:22.090> means<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:24.280> don't<00:03:24.489> want<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.650> go<00:03:26.650> across

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
which means you don't want to go across

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.410 
which means you don't want to go across
the<00:03:27.160> whole<00:03:27.340> thing<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.670> then<00:03:27.760> go<00:03:27.880> back<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.239> try

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
the whole thing and then go back and try

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.570 
the whole thing and then go back and try
to<00:03:28.480> smooth<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.989> out<00:03:29.140> you're<00:03:29.980> going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.220> start

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
to smooth it out you're going to start

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.840 
to smooth it out you're going to start
at<00:03:30.700> one<00:03:30.910> end<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.390> work<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.049> other<00:03:32.200> end

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
at one end and work to the other end

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.380 
at one end and work to the other end
making<00:03:33.850> sure<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:35.320> as<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.709> go<00:03:35.890> along<00:03:36.390> you're

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
making sure that as you go along you're

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.940 
making sure that as you go along you're
smoothing<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:37.989> out<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.350> don't<00:03:38.590> have<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.830> go

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
smoothing it out so you don't have to go

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.170 
smoothing it out so you don't have to go
back<00:03:39.100> over<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.459> because<00:03:39.700> you're<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.000> end

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
back over it because you're going to end

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.000 
back over it because you're going to end
up<00:03:40.360> if<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:41.110> were<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.620> try<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.830> go

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
possibly can do and I got a little bit

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.860 
possibly can do and I got a little bit
too<00:05:10.700> much<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:11.240> I'm<00:05:11.330> just<00:05:11.420> kind<00:05:11.630> of<00:05:11.690> wiping

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
too much on so I'm just kind of wiping

it off and you want as you go through
you<00:05:15.080> might<00:05:15.260> end<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:15.590> seeing<00:05:15.890> that<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.100> get

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
you might end up seeing that you get

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.650 
you might end up seeing that you get
little<00:05:16.550> tiny<00:05:17.020> hairs<00:05:18.020> or<00:05:18.610> lint<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:20.270> in<00:05:20.390> it<00:05:20.510> so

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
little tiny hairs or lint just in it so

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.030 
little tiny hairs or lint just in it so
just<00:05:20.690> take<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> dry<00:05:21.440> part<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:22.010> your<00:05:22.070> rag<00:05:22.460> and

quickly just wipe it off if you let it
sit<00:05:26.990> in<00:05:27.020> there<00:05:27.380> there's<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.340> good<00:05:28.550> chance<00:05:28.820> it

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
sit in there there's a good chance it

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.400 
sit in there there's a good chance it
will<00:05:29.090> harden<00:05:29.480> in<00:05:29.540> there<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:29.900> only<00:05:30.170> way<00:05:30.290> you're

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.800 
will harden in there and only way you're
going<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.560> get<00:05:30.710> it<00:05:30.830> off<00:05:30.980> is<00:05:31.640> if<00:05:32.000> you<00:05:32.180> stand<00:05:32.570> it

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
going to get it off is if you stand it

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.900 
going to get it off is if you stand it
off<00:05:32.950> one<00:05:33.950> thing<00:05:34.100> I<00:05:34.160> also<00:05:34.310> wanted<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.700> mention

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
off one thing I also wanted to mention

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.270 
off one thing I also wanted to mention
is<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.570> reason<00:05:35.960> I'm<00:05:36.080> going<00:05:36.350> to<00:05:36.710> straight

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
is the reason I'm going to straight

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.100 
is the reason I'm going to straight
across<00:05:37.550> is<00:05:37.910> because<00:05:38.240> if<00:05:38.390> you<00:05:38.510> swirl<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:38.900> around

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
across is because if you swirl it around

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.140 
across is because if you swirl it around
I<00:05:39.560> think<00:05:39.950> it<00:05:40.040> actually<00:05:40.490> tells<00:05:40.730> you<00:05:40.910> in<00:05:41.030> the

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
I think it actually tells you in the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.150 
I think it actually tells you in the
instructions<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.720> swirl<00:05:41.960> it<00:05:42.050> around<00:05:42.110> if<00:05:42.830> you

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
instructions to swirl it around if you

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.900 
instructions to swirl it around if you
do<00:05:43.370> that<00:05:44.890> it'll<00:05:45.890> look<00:05:46.040> swirling<00:05:46.640> on<00:05:46.730> your

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
do that it'll look swirling on your

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.730 
do that it'll look swirling on your
piece<00:05:47.090> you'll<00:05:47.360> be<00:05:47.480> able<00:05:47.570> to<00:05:47.840> tell<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.200> it's

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
piece you'll be able to tell that it's

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.150 
piece you'll be able to tell that it's
really<00:05:49.100> won't<00:05:49.340> look<00:05:49.900> even<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.710> swirls<00:05:52.010> were

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
really won't look even the swirls were

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.100 
really won't look even the swirls were
pretty<00:05:52.490> good<00:05:52.700> if<00:05:52.820> you're<00:05:53.000> doing<00:05:53.360> wood<00:05:53.750> but<00:05:53.990> on

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
pretty good if you're doing wood but on

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.630 
pretty good if you're doing wood but on
painting<00:05:54.560> furniture<00:05:54.740> especially<00:05:55.160> with<00:05:55.550> the

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
painting furniture especially with the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.180 
painting furniture especially with the
chalk<00:05:55.850> paint<00:05:56.150> it's<00:05:56.990> really<00:05:57.470> much<00:05:57.710> much<00:05:57.980> better

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
chalk paint it's really much much better

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.719 
chalk paint it's really much much better
to<00:05:58.520> just<00:05:58.790> go<00:05:59.060> in<00:05:59.900> one<00:06:00.169> direction<00:06:00.400> either<00:06:01.400> cost

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
to just go in one direction either cost

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.830 
to just go in one direction either cost
or<00:06:02.169> horizontal<00:06:03.169> whatever<00:06:04.419> works<00:06:05.419> best<00:06:05.570> for

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
or horizontal whatever works best for

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.469 
or horizontal whatever works best for
the<00:06:06.050> piece<00:06:06.229> you're<00:06:06.410> working<00:06:06.440> on<00:06:06.800> and<00:06:07.760> then

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
the piece you're working on and then

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.110 
the piece you're working on and then
you'll<00:06:08.870> let<00:06:09.050> this<00:06:09.229> dry<00:06:09.620> it<00:06:10.280> dries<00:06:10.760> a<00:06:10.790> lot

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
you'll let this dry it dries a lot

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.820 
you'll let this dry it dries a lot
faster<00:06:11.630> with<00:06:11.810> chalk<00:06:12.050> paint<00:06:12.350> than<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.620> does

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
faster with chalk paint than it does

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.290 
faster with chalk paint than it does
with<00:06:13.550> wood

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
with wood

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.500 
with wood
so<00:06:15.080> you're<00:06:15.290> probably<00:06:15.530> I<00:06:16.100> wait<00:06:16.940> about<00:06:17.060> an<00:06:17.330> hour

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
so you're probably I wait about an hour

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.330 
so you're probably I wait about an hour
in<00:06:17.870> between<00:06:18.290> each<00:06:18.410> piece<00:06:18.650> usually<00:06:19.070> about<00:06:19.190> the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
in between each piece usually about the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.800 
in between each piece usually about the
time<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.669> takes<00:06:19.820> me<00:06:19.970> to<00:06:20.090> finish<00:06:20.419> the<00:06:20.660> whole

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
time it takes me to finish the whole

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.719 
time it takes me to finish the whole
piece<00:06:21.020> I'm<00:06:21.200> going<00:06:21.440> back<00:06:21.680> around<00:06:21.950> on<00:06:22.160> my<00:06:22.310> second

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
piece I'm going back around on my second

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.030 
piece I'm going back around on my second
coat<00:06:23.110> even<00:06:24.110> though<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.320> bottle<00:06:24.620> says<00:06:24.800> to<00:06:24.919> me

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
coat even though the bottle says to me

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.250 
coat even though the bottle says to me
at<00:06:25.190> least<00:06:25.460> two<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:25.729> three<00:06:25.940> hours<00:06:26.270> I've<00:06:26.900> only

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
at least two to three hours I've only

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.140 
at least two to three hours I've only
ever<00:06:27.410> needed<00:06:28.010> to<00:06:28.040> do<00:06:28.280> that<00:06:28.460> when<00:06:28.669> I<00:06:28.700> was<00:06:28.790> doing

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
ever needed to do that when I was doing

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.969 
ever needed to do that when I was doing
a<00:06:30.110> stained<00:06:30.740> piece<00:06:31.070> so<00:06:31.880> I<00:06:31.910> would<00:06:32.360> I<00:06:32.600> I<00:06:33.140> generally

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
a stained piece so I would I I generally

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.370 
a stained piece so I would I I generally
only<00:06:34.010> wait<00:06:34.340> about<00:06:34.490> an<00:06:34.790> hour<00:06:34.970> and<00:06:35.330> I<00:06:35.930> just<00:06:36.260> feel

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
only wait about an hour and I just feel

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.290 
only wait about an hour and I just feel
it<00:06:36.560> make<00:06:36.710> sure<00:06:36.919> it's<00:06:37.100> dry<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.490> even<00:06:37.970> and<00:06:38.150> then

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
it make sure it's dry and even and then

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.930 
it make sure it's dry and even and then
I<00:06:38.479> go<00:06:39.320> ahead<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:39.740> sand<00:06:39.979> it<00:06:40.220> you<00:06:40.610> want<00:06:40.760> to<00:06:40.850> make

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
I go ahead and sand it you want to make

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.010 
I go ahead and sand it you want to make
sure<00:06:41.000> you're<00:06:41.240> standing<00:06:41.390> in<00:06:41.660> between<00:06:41.780> each

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
sure you're standing in between each

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.080 
sure you're standing in between each
coat<00:06:42.290> except<00:06:43.160> on<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.370> last<00:06:43.550> coat<00:06:43.790> you're<00:06:43.940> just

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
coat except on the last coat you're just

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.940 
coat except on the last coat you're just
going<00:06:44.240> to<00:06:44.300> leave<00:06:44.510> it<00:06:44.630> there<00:06:45.080> are<00:06:45.290> people<00:06:45.530> who

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
going to leave it there are people who

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.300 
going to leave it there are people who
also<00:06:46.190> on<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.729> last<00:06:46.970> coat<00:06:47.500> will<00:06:48.500> dilute<00:06:48.979> this

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
also on the last coat will dilute this

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.610 
also on the last coat will dilute this
down<00:06:49.700> to<00:06:50.390> about<00:06:50.419> 75%<00:06:51.140> water<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:52.240> 25%

down to about 75% water and 25%
polyurethane<00:06:54.620> that's<00:06:55.550> just<00:06:55.790> an<00:06:55.940> option<00:06:56.150> I

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
polyurethane that's just an option I

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.450 
polyurethane that's just an option I
don't<00:06:56.900> usually<00:06:57.169> do<00:06:57.560> it<00:06:57.680> unless<00:06:57.919> I'm<00:06:58.130> having

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
don't usually do it unless I'm having

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.400 
don't usually do it unless I'm having
problems<00:06:58.610> with<00:06:58.970> streaking<00:06:59.600> on<00:06:59.720> that

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
problems with streaking on that

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.680 
problems with streaking on that
particular<00:07:01.040> piece<00:07:01.340> all<00:07:01.729> it<00:07:02.060> really<00:07:02.240> does<00:07:02.630> is

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
particular piece all it really does is

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.310 
particular piece all it really does is
make<00:07:03.169> it<00:07:03.350> so<00:07:03.530> that<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.740> last<00:07:04.310> coat<00:07:04.880> is<00:07:05.570> super

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
make it so that that last coat is super

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.280 
make it so that that last coat is super
thin<00:07:06.680> and<00:07:07.010> it<00:07:07.610> covers<00:07:08.030> up<00:07:08.210> any<00:07:08.810> kind<00:07:09.169> of

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.290 
thin and it covers up any kind of

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.670 
thin and it covers up any kind of
imperfection<00:07:10.010> but<00:07:10.040> you're<00:07:10.310> really<00:07:11.680> you're

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
imperfection but you're really you're

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.770 
imperfection but you're really you're
just<00:07:12.710> evening<00:07:13.370> out<00:07:13.520> the<00:07:13.700> sheen<00:07:14.030> if<00:07:14.360> that<00:07:14.570> makes

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
just evening out the sheen if that makes

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.570 
just evening out the sheen if that makes
sense<00:07:14.900> so<00:07:15.200> that's<00:07:15.740> an<00:07:15.890> option<00:07:16.280> if<00:07:16.430> you're

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
sense so that's an option if you're

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.670 
sense so that's an option if you're
having<00:07:16.790> problems<00:07:17.030> go<00:07:17.930> ahead<00:07:18.110> and<00:07:18.260> try<00:07:18.470> that

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
having problems go ahead and try that

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.880
