using<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> clutch<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.780> every<00:00:57.989> time<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.199> change

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
using the clutch so every time I change

this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.570> taken<00:01:45.869> away<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> clutch<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this is taken away when the clutch is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.160 
this is taken away when the clutch is
disengaged<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.329> feel<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.720> you

the clutch you can come down the gears
still<00:02:46.790> under<00:02:47.090> development<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.690> lot<00:02:47.810> of

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
still under development a lot of

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.199 
still under development a lot of
tweaking<00:02:48.200> still<00:02:48.590> has<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:48.890> be<00:02:48.920> done<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:50.000> this

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
tweaking still has to be done but this

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.699 
tweaking still has to be done but this
is<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.660> technology<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.739> future<00:02:53.709> so

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
is the technology of the future so

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.680 
is the technology of the future so
that's<00:02:54.950> what<00:02:55.190> will<00:02:55.370> make<00:02:55.519> driving<00:02:55.850> easy<00:02:56.209> but

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
that's what will make driving easy but

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.030 
that's what will make driving easy but
here's<00:02:56.930> something<00:02:57.230> that's<00:02:57.590> going<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.860> change

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
here's something that's going to change

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.670 
here's something that's going to change
the<00:02:58.190> way<00:02:58.430> our<00:02:58.670> infotainment<00:02:59.480> systems<00:03:00.110> work

display<00:04:21.359> for<00:04:22.049> example<00:04:22.079> in<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> cluster<00:04:23.280> just

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
display for example in the cluster just

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.240

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.310 
to avoid deviation from the driver
attention<00:04:26.970> from<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.240> center<00:04:27.539> stack<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.229> you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
attention from the center stack so you

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.800 
attention from the center stack so you
can<00:04:28.470> just<00:04:28.680> swipe<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.330> context

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
can just swipe in so this context

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.570 
can just swipe in so this context

whatever there in the center stack are
to<00:04:32.789> the<00:04:32.910> cluster<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.020> will<00:04:34.139> get<00:04:34.740> into<00:04:34.949> that

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
to the cluster so it will get into that

there a lot there's a lot of information
there<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:49.889> usually<00:04:50.849> so<00:04:51.270> much<00:04:51.330> information<00:04:51.960> is

limited to find out more it is very good
that<00:05:33.599> this<00:05:33.930> happened<00:05:34.430> because<00:05:35.870> this<00:05:36.870> we<00:05:37.050> have

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
that this happened because this we have

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.899 
that this happened because this we have
really<00:05:37.680> a<00:05:37.889> stability<00:05:39.409> hence<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.620> market<00:05:41.039> will

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
really a stability hence a market will

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.450 
really a stability hence a market will
now<00:05:42.120> say<00:05:42.509> what<00:05:43.229> is<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.500> really<00:05:43.860> demand<00:05:44.220> of

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
now say what is a really demand of

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.689 
now say what is a really demand of
diesel<00:05:44.849> and<00:05:44.970> gasoline<00:05:45.409> vehicles<00:05:46.490> in<00:05:47.490> this

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
diesel and gasoline vehicles in this

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.189 
diesel and gasoline vehicles in this
moment<00:05:48.090> where<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.300> have<00:05:48.389> subsidies<00:05:48.930> he<00:05:49.080> has<00:05:49.169> a

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
moment where you have subsidies he has a

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.550 
moment where you have subsidies he has a
risk<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:49.919> subsidies<00:05:50.430> will<00:05:50.610> changed

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
risk that subsidies will changed

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.779 
risk that subsidies will changed
positive<00:05:52.560> or<00:05:52.740> negative<00:05:53.159> and<00:05:53.340> then<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.580> have<00:05:53.699> a

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
positive or negative and then you have a

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.089 
positive or negative and then you have a
problem<00:05:54.979> so<00:05:55.979> we<00:05:56.400> appreciate<00:05:56.610> this<00:05:58.070> sea<00:05:59.070> change

problem so we appreciate this sea change

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.640 
problem so we appreciate this sea change
in<00:05:59.729> the<00:05:59.789> market<00:06:00.300> after<00:06:00.539> subsidies<00:06:01.229> we<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.440> in

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
in the market after subsidies we it in

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.290 
in the market after subsidies we it in
the<00:06:01.800> one<00:06:01.949> we<00:06:02.070> have<00:06:02.159> no<00:06:02.310> subsidies<00:06:02.789> for<00:06:03.120> these

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
the one we have no subsidies for these

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.279 
the one we have no subsidies for these
and<00:06:03.830> you<00:06:04.830> see<00:06:05.099> is<00:06:05.159> that<00:06:05.280> now<00:06:06.169> after<00:06:07.169> this

positive diesel price price is dropping

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.839 
positive diesel price price is dropping
down<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.960> we<00:06:10.800> don't<00:06:10.979> see<00:06:11.310> at<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:11.699> moment
