 cinematic shadows spider man laughs 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:23.980
 a successful 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.009
 is the story will faithfully follow the same argument from the movie so 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.169
 what 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.399
 our hero piter parker will have to face nothing less than the assassin of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.390
 your uncle ben 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.890
 although it will not be so easy since it has now become 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.580
 complicate things even more the green goblin his archenemy has 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.040

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.230
 his son jarry the vows takes his relief moved only by his thirst for 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.230
 revenge 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.660
 and if we still did not have enough 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.640
 problems will also make its appearance in January 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.750
 the next one coming from the space that tries to take over the adult 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.730
 the environment of our protagonist 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.300
 although thanks to this we can make use of new skills besides being 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.300
 much stronger and faster in the coma 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.510
 at the time of playing its mechanics will not be complete freedom again 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.930
 to move around the broad mateando with hardly any restrictions 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.990
 being able to focus 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.479

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.909
 showing us a city of more detailed characters than ever 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.140
 although it is still evident that being a multiplatform title the 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.829
