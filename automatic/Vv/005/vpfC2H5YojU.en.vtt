were the chemicals that are used preyed

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.530 
were the chemicals that are used preyed
on<00:03:37.160> them<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.580> they're<00:03:37.700> trying<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.000> avoid<00:03:38.270> them

modified or not and that is something
that<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.830> have<00:03:46.100> brought<00:03:46.250> up<00:03:46.400> as<00:03:46.520> well<00:03:46.670> at<00:03:46.790> the

meaning is that the company should get

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.960 
meaning is that the company should get
behind<00:03:48.590> efforts<00:03:49.190> if<00:03:49.460> you<00:03:49.670> want<00:03:49.820> to<00:03:49.880> be

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
behind efforts if you want to be

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.480 
behind efforts if you want to be
transparent<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:51.320> ought<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.500> label<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.280> food

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
transparent you ought to label the food

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.710 
transparent you ought to label the food
so<00:03:53.210> yes<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.440> have<00:03:54.830> people<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> FDA<00:03:56.390> like

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
so yes you have people in the FDA like

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.410 
so yes you have people in the FDA like
