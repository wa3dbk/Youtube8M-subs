 every game you hope they are and today 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.369
 here we are on a track much more 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.500
 very very crazy indeed 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.269
 It's a lane on the beach always struggling to 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.949
 none that for now is to avoid touching 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.900
 the head because mike is here 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.390
 The microphone that hangs here is 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.610
 in the shape of a statue in the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.780
 microphone beauty 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.040
 first we will get a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.940
 light road that arrives in our 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.070
 beach, that's you, it never comes straight 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.350
 on the track does not carry a direct place 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.450
 in the extra time of the little one that in the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.520
 reality, right and let's go the dollar today 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.129

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.539
 microphone beauty and so then we 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.980
 here I am against the hand is dangerous 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.000
 pass a car pass over me 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.129
 so let's go to them and I'll get 450 enem 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.899
 I thank rafael soffiatti for having 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.879

 I like him so strange , we'll see you later. 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.880
 arriving here at one thousand per hour on the runway 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.700
 here on the right side you can see that the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.990
 of the poultry lane and cattle and the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.049
 palm trees here almost had no 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.040
 Even though I'm not mistaken, it's because 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.990
 the band just passed the palm trees 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.810
 I was in the street I think that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.329
 make the victory curve here beauty 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.100
 We have bushes here in the middle of the street. 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.119
 It's a mistake so I'm going to fix it yet. 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.909
 Okay, I'll talk on the worry track. 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.799
 and we arrived at our beloved beach is 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.500
 already speaking the track is not 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.280
 ready yet beauty and to our dear 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.619
 For us to walk huge place and 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.540
 I did not do it here, nor did I do that. 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 this one keeps umbrellas six umbrellas 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.040
 umbrella shadow umbrella 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.570
 I do not know what the name of this is when 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.030
 it's raining it's an umbrella 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.500
 when there is sun and an umbrella and when 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 there is very much just an umbrella 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 so you can not understand then 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.030
 deserves then long of departure matters 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 Let's here, then, start monitoring. 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.500
 here in our guide 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170
 where is the gate kennel gate paulo has said 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.310

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.010
 gate start here then beauty because 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 talk there by the market do not know 9 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.290
 let's go like this, then let's go not good 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.069

 You can see my name on the hay and the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.450
 beautiful and paulo if the name of the 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.400
 end on the new child is your name 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.709
 important of the order points on a map of the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.120
 fucking joke is that I liked 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.660
 You put my name on the track and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.510
 put an ounce here then the campaign 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.100
 mediocre does not segment the lane well 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.590
 the little narrow little galley to 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.660
 to simulate a Brazilian search even 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.790
 My mouth, because it needs Brazilian. 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.950
 my mouth like that, right? 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.680
 It's not a joke, I do not want to take it. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.600
 because unfortunately it is what is what the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.700
 people have and hardest in the galley is 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.519
 Short but you can enjoy the beach 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.680
 paper not only used here bringing 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:26.110
 A jovial joke but none of this 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.110
 thereafter never be now 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:35.939
 fifty phone that made a half sock 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.019
 to do the inside that beauty does not 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.909
 get off track 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.390
 all I 'm seeing here was what 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:46.379
 it's everything everything everything everything everything everything 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.469
 microphone where it 's been since billboards there 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.000
 statues of chaos everything everything everything I do not 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.019
 I stole from any creator right now 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.980
 because you do not know the mx 2 and mx mxs-r 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.930
 enduro received 11 strike half crazy for 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.500
 cause of creators and bmx track 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.129
 simulator but I do not know why either 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.459
 is well received there do not know if it's because 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.569
 I picked it up from another creator and he 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.220
 did not like it and did what 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.959
 our only biggest ramp on the track here 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:28.680
 Even though I could not get the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:30.570
 magistrate microphone perform well there 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.190
 status path this way right here 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:38.820
 for us the microphone I just said 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.280
 It's a clue to show that I 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.080
 private lane paulo reis 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.180
 for those who already know prr1 ppr 2 is this 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.130
 hence it is pr3 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.610
 I'll try to find the link download pp 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.020
 and pr 2 to 1 and leave in the description of the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.780
 Video is good 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.699
 our way is enough now is to stay 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.699
 in the description of the video and hence the little goat 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.910
 and is also skeptical when it was like casting 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.980
 this pizza which I think is still 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.420
 week or next week to calm pitta 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.920
 What are you giving and I'm going to make one more? 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.900
 medinho 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.550
 There you can download it in the 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.350
 beauty video description only that will not 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.330
 is then no use you ask Paulo 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:26.100
 where the download link of the track does not have 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:28.140
 Your child does not have a joke. 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.090
 still going calm people patience because 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.390
 It takes a week to make the 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.590
 table containing my there will also 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.590
 It depends on my horniness. 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:44.819
 wonder not stopping on the track that we are going 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.250
 Enjoy the beach then show it to you. 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.410
 I know if I'm going to choose one. 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.419
 place here to sit on the bike and 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.990
 swim a little, it's like that 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.509
 Let's not go here so let's stop here. 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.680
 Come on in our zone. 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:05.699
 beautiful kizomba chitata our're seeing is 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.710
 as seen in the salty air in our one 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:12.539
 that they north in the morning on leaving the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.830
 hotel and beauty will not get into the water 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.389
 because nothing happens or nothing happens 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.590
 personal you will simply walk in 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.599
 up the water, right? 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.599
 I think now it's going to come out of there 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:26.220
 water is not a game of 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:27.539
 motocross long and gta5 so lets go 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.389
 so I think I'll stay right here 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.669
 I do not have much to say 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:40.159
 this track that will be released is still 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:40.159
 this week or not the deal 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:46.270
 So beauty does not stick around here so it's already 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.449
 in the video sign up for the channel and paulo 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.449
 saucer
