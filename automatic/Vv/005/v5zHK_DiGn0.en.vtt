besides<00:02:24.310> minecraft<00:02:25.030> don't<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.599> me<00:02:25.690> wrong

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
besides minecraft don't get me wrong

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.720 
besides minecraft don't get me wrong
though<00:02:25.989> i<00:02:26.170> love<00:02:26.379> minecraft<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.099> can<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.670> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
though i love minecraft and can going to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.680 
though i love minecraft and can going to
continue<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.239> series<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.840> much<00:02:29.110> as<00:02:29.260> i<00:02:29.349> can

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
continue that series as much as i can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.240 
continue that series as much as i can
but<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.959> would<00:02:32.049> allow<00:02:32.260> me<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.500> do<00:02:32.650> more<00:02:32.980> of

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
but it would allow me to do more of

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.850 
but it would allow me to do more of
other<00:02:33.430> stuff<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.930> i<00:02:34.959> wouldn't<00:02:35.379> be<00:02:35.470> limited<00:02:35.829> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
other stuff so i wouldn't be limited to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.300 
other stuff so i wouldn't be limited to
just<00:02:36.159> minecraft<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.709> there's<00:02:39.040> that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
just minecraft so you know there's that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.199 
just minecraft so you know there's that
too<00:02:39.810> um<00:02:41.280> plus<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.459> i<00:02:42.549> said<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.790> exposure

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
too um plus like i said the exposure

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.110 
too um plus like i said the exposure
would<00:02:43.660> really<00:02:44.019> help<00:02:44.140> my<00:02:44.319> channel<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.640> overall

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
would really help my channel but overall

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.330 
would really help my channel but overall
I<00:02:46.239> think<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.720> would<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.959> good<00:02:47.680> choice<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.040> me

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I think it would be a good choice for me

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.440 
I think it would be a good choice for me
to<00:02:48.459> do<00:02:48.609> so<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.620> would<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.519> like<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.239> said<00:02:52.420> I

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
didn't want to just make this choice

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.229 
didn't want to just make this choice
