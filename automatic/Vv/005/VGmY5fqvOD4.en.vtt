00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 now we design our door 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.030
 shock absorber we put ourselves on the plane 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.389
 front and open a sketch we go 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.009
 to draw a centerline 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.009
 vertical passing through the origin 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.019
 we are going to trace the profile of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.099
 our piece that we want to revolutionize 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.099
 we do more or less this way 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.340
 and then we go and vote first 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:53.769
 the diameters of this diameter here we say 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.780
 which is a diameter of ten 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:00.070
 this diameter here we say we go 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 at 35 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.239
 the largest diameter let's say that 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.239
 let's go up to 40 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 this diameter here we say that a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.250
 diameter of 30 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:24.690
 the devil makes small we indicate it in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.720
 20 mm then we go to dimension the lengths 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:33.620
 so this hole here we say it is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.620
 15 mm long yes 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:40.619
 this recovery here we say that profound 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:47.259
 8 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:52.409
 the outer head let's say it 's 10 this 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:57.009
 part here linear we indicate line 152 mm 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.680
 the piece that goes from here that will be the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.960
 cone length we say that 50 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.710
 elements 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.649
 now let's go to give a position between 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.130
 of the end and the origin we indicate line 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.040
 100 m has been placed with respect 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.200
 at the beginning it seems to me to have posed 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.709
 all we have to do is fix a little 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 quote just drag and drop them to 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.920
 put so as not to do too much 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.920
 confusion 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.930
 we can touch and go to 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 position to make us see better 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.820
 ok let's get out of the sketch 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.060
 selected the sketch from the card 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.200
 function we make a basic exclusion of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.290
 Yup 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.330
 that's done by our exclusion 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.290
 at this point we can put ourselves up 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.140
 this plan can at the top and go there 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.590
 open a sketch putting us normal 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:05.730
 so let's trace 22 rectangles 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.720
 more or less in this way we trace here 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.010
 these rectangles one on the left and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.580
 the other we do it right in this 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.760
 It was here 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.000
 which will serve us to make two cuts 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.070
 we are going to quote these two yes 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.530
 place less than the center 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.040
 respectively at 5 mm in this 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.180
 direction both on one side and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.550
 on the other 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:47.750
 we indicate 5 we put this dimension 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:50.390
 and let's put it on 25 meters here 25 we give 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.460
 a position with respect to the origin also 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:01.790
 as for the height we put 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:06.420
 25 both from here and there 25 we go to give 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.850
 a total measure that will be 50 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.060
 both for one and then for the other 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.790
 this 50 is not needed because i am 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.790
 bound in themselves very well a 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.100
 this point I go out of the sketch in vado 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.540
 to make a cut-off cut 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.780
 of exclusion which I will indicate in 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.300
 a height of 70 mm 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.210
 in this way here so I created these 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.900
 these two fine planes on one side of the 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:40.250
 plans that just created the selection e 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.520
 I'm going to open to prolis I'm going to trace 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.900
 one straight nose the starboard that 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.380
 trace in this direction 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.120
 in this way I am going to pose it and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.550
 let's go put happy ray 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.460
 we put radius 6 we put it from 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.530
 this point here at the radius has one 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:11.650
 length of 14 mm and having one 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:17.150
 total length per axis equal to 30 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.020
 ok this point is built our a 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.810
 freezes I can get out of the sketch and do 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:30.439
 an extrusion cut a cut 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:33.800
 passing in this way ok to this 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.870
 point I can go to give a color to the 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.139
 our object that as usual 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.300
 let's do white let's make it white as 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.199
 we did the other parts by taking 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.599
 led lights and let's choose white 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:51.469
 white in this manner here holding 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:53.360
 maybe it's the consumption part at the top 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:58.240
 let's take it from another color 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.159
 so let's select this this border 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.490
 holding down the shift key I press 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:08.029
 also that upper edge I go to 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.680
 rotate the piece to watch you catch 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.860
 even the face below 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.039
 in this way p I open the folder 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.449
 of the aspects I go to see painted 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:22.150
 machine and I choose black 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.909
 ok let's see if the object is 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.520
 fully painted exact limit 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:30.009
 if I want to paint the part too 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.529
 inside the selection and I go to indicate 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.050
 which is therefore also black 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:38.319
 painted black car and also put 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.449
 for the ciara levels ok this too is 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.449
 another part we have concluded
