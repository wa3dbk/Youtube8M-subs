00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
is even more 3d models are able to be

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.920 
is even more 3d models are able to be
imported<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> 3d<00:00:26.550> file<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.119> notice<00:00:27.840> right

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
imported from a 3d file and notice right

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.060 
imported from a 3d file and notice right
down<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.010> import<00:00:29.160> piyu<00:00:30.000> 3d<00:00:31.070> VRML

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
down here you can import piyu 3d VRML

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
down here you can import piyu 3d VRML
which<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> WRL<00:00:33.149> file<00:00:33.390> format<00:00:33.930> 3d<00:00:34.860> scans

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
which is the WRL file format 3d scans

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 
which is the WRL file format 3d scans
whatever<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.000> case<00:00:36.210> may<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:37.140> all

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
whatever the case may be but really all

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
whatever the case may be but really all
you<00:00:37.710> need<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.250> grab<00:00:38.820> whatever<00:00:39.239> file

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you need to do is grab whatever file

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
you need to do is grab whatever file
format<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> want<00:00:40.260> put<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.010> its<00:00:41.160> new<00:00:41.460> layer

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
format you want put it on its new layer

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.569 
format you want put it on its new layer
and<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.690> actually<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.440> 3d<00:00:44.250> scan<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and again this is actually a 3d scan I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
and again this is actually a 3d scan I
can<00:00:44.760> see<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> rotate

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
can see it right here and I can rotate

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
can see it right here and I can rotate
it<00:00:46.440> around<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.219> start<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> work<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:47.879> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it around and start to work with this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
it around and start to work with this
but<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:50.070> want

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
but what I want to do is I actually want

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180 
but what I want to do is I actually want
to<00:00:50.489> paint<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.710> select<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to paint on it so I will select the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.220 
to paint on it so I will select the
brush<00:00:53.670> tool<00:00:53.730> start<00:00:54.360> painting<00:00:54.600> accordingly

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
brush tool start painting accordingly

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.650 
brush tool start painting accordingly
and<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> typically<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:57.030> but

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and that's what you typically do but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.270 
and that's what you typically do but
then<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> typically<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> select<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
then you typically have to select the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
then you typically have to select the
move<00:00:59.550> tool<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.910> rotate<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> around<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.320> paint

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
move tool and rotate it around and paint

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.399 
move tool and rotate it around and paint
some<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
some more or what you can do is you

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.429 
some more or what you can do is you
could<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:04.880> use<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:06.510> controls<00:01:07.140> right

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
could actually use these controls right

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
could actually use these controls right
down<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> lower<00:01:08.549> left<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.540> paint

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
down in the lower left so as I paint

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.530 
down in the lower left so as I paint
notice<00:01:10.680> how<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.070> rotate<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.549> around<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.330> say

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
notice how I can rotate it around to say

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.810 
notice how I can rotate it around to say
the<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:12.869> side<00:01:13.170> start<00:01:13.890> painting<00:01:14.340> some<00:01:14.369> more

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the back side start painting some more

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
the back side start painting some more
maybe<00:01:15.750> even<00:01:15.900> change<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> color<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.159> can

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
maybe even change the color but you can

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
maybe even change the color but you can
see<00:01:17.549> how<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> doesn't<00:01:18.090> disrupt<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:19.409> workflow

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
see how it doesn't disrupt my workflow

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.429 
see how it doesn't disrupt my workflow
when<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> start<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> paint<00:01:21.540> accordingly<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
when I start to paint accordingly as I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.830 
when I start to paint accordingly as I
select<00:01:22.860> again<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> different<00:01:24.330> color<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
select again a different color and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160 
select again a different color and
rotate<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> start<00:01:26.280> painting<00:01:26.490> again<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> again

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
rotate and start painting again so again

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.260 
rotate and start painting again so again
that<00:01:28.380> flexibility<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that flexibility is what I want when it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.749 
that flexibility is what I want when it
comes<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:31.290> workflow<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.310> using<00:01:32.670> these

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
comes to my workflow is using these

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
comes to my workflow is using these
controls<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> getting<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> painted<00:01:34.619> just

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
controls and getting that painted just

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340 
controls and getting that painted just
right<00:01:35.130> okay<00:01:35.610> well<00:01:36.030> let's<00:01:36.180> sort<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> take<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
right okay well let's sort of take it to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.850 
right okay well let's sort of take it to
the<00:01:37.619> next<00:01:38.009> level<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.829> what<00:01:40.829> I

the next level if you will and what I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
the next level if you will and what I
want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.369> now<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:42.780> want<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.389 
give it some grittiness so I want to
apply<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> bump<00:01:46.110> map<00:01:46.439> okay<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> go

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
apply a bump map okay so I'm going to go

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.380 
apply a bump map okay so I'm going to go
to<00:01:47.460> 3d<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> material<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.460> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
to 3d and this is the material for this

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
to 3d and this is the material for this
3d<00:01:52.049> object<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.770> mesh<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:54.060> apply<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
3d object this mesh so I can apply a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
3d object this mesh so I can apply a
bump<00:01:54.750> map<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> say<00:01:55.890> new<00:01:56.130> texture

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
bump map to it so I can say new texture

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.670 
bump map to it so I can say new texture
ok<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.630> click<00:01:57.899> OK<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.540> select<00:02:01.500> edit

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
ok just click OK and I can select edit

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.550 
ok just click OK and I can select edit
texture<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.210> typically<00:02:03.780> you'll<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.140> bump

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
texture so typically you'll have a bump

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350 
texture so typically you'll have a bump
map<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.670> could<00:02:06.030> again<00:02:06.299> be

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
map in here and this could again be

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.990 
map in here and this could again be
anything<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.469> want<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:08.879> I'm

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
anything that you want but what I'm

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.570 
anything that you want but what I'm
gonna<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.360> Anna<00:02:09.509> paste<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.470> photo<00:02:11.190> this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
gonna do is Anna paste in a photo this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.360 
gonna do is Anna paste in a photo this
is<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.790> photo<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.629> marble

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
is a photo of some marble

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.539 
is a photo of some marble
and<00:02:13.459> what<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.750> do<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.200> any<00:02:15.500> photo<00:02:16.069> is

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
and what you can do with any photo is

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.030 
and what you can do with any photo is
you<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.239> take<00:02:17.420> any<00:02:17.480> photo<00:02:18.049> and<00:02:18.379> turn<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.860> into

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you can take any photo and turn it into

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.289 
you can take any photo and turn it into
a<00:02:19.250> bump<00:02:19.730> map<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.440> filter<00:02:21.830> 3d<00:02:22.459> generate

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
a bump map so go to filter 3d generate

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.320 
a bump map so go to filter 3d generate
bump<00:02:24.080> map<00:02:24.319> or<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.370> even<00:02:25.610> generate<00:02:25.849> a

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
bump map or you can even generate a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.750 
bump map or you can even generate a
normal<00:02:26.959> map<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.470> again<00:02:27.680> it'll<00:02:27.830> just<00:02:28.040> change

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
normal map and again it'll just change

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.250 
normal map and again it'll just change
it<00:02:28.909> to<00:02:29.000> black<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.390> white<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.720> smooth<00:02:30.049> out

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
it to black and white and smooth out

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.039 
it to black and white and smooth out
some<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.620> those<00:02:30.769> levels<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.549> what<00:02:31.849> it<00:02:31.970> does<00:02:32.180> but

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
some of those levels is what it does but

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.170 
some of those levels is what it does but
essentially<00:02:33.560> that's<00:02:33.769> all<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.040> need<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.459> do<00:02:34.610> so

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
essentially that's all I need to do so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.729 
essentially that's all I need to do so
close<00:02:35.420> now<00:02:35.569> file<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.959> can<00:02:36.110> see<00:02:36.319> it's<00:02:36.440> given

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
close now file you can see it's given

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.740 
close now file you can see it's given
her<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.040> sort<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.310> greediness<00:02:37.790> which<00:02:38.629> is

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
her that sort of greediness which is

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.809 
her that sort of greediness which is
exactly<00:02:39.230> what<00:02:39.470> I'm<00:02:39.560> going<00:02:39.769> for<00:02:40.129> in<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.519> case

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
exactly what I'm going for in this case

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.319 
exactly what I'm going for in this case
and<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.299> can<00:02:41.510> always<00:02:42.129> again<00:02:43.129> make<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.879> less<00:02:44.150> of

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
and I can always again make that less of

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.119 
and I can always again make that less of
a<00:02:44.480> bump<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.959> want<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.379> as<00:02:45.530> well<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:45.920> have

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
a bump if I want to as well so you have

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.910 
a bump if I want to as well so you have
full<00:02:46.370> control<00:02:46.780> whether<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.019> an<00:02:48.230> image<00:02:48.709> like

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
full control whether it's an image like

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.920 
full control whether it's an image like
this<00:02:49.190> maybe<00:02:49.549> it's<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:50.030> different<00:02:50.569> image

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
this maybe it's a different image

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.900 
this maybe it's a different image
entirely<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.890> again<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.400> show<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.670> how

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
entirely and again just to show you how

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.150 
entirely and again just to show you how
you<00:02:52.970> could<00:02:53.299> take<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.140> photo<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.709> turn<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.010> into

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
you could take a photo and turn it into

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.119 
you could take a photo and turn it into
a<00:02:55.760> bump<00:02:56.450> map<00:02:56.620> turning<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.709> black<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.040> white

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
a bump map turning it black and white

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.819 
a bump map turning it black and white
turning<00:02:59.060> into<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.420> mesh<00:02:59.900> from<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.290> depth<00:03:00.530> map

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
turning into a mesh from that depth map

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.130 
turning into a mesh from that depth map
click<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.670> create<00:03:01.849> this<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:02.599> really

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
click and create this is a really

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410 
click and create this is a really
extreme<00:03:03.590> example<00:03:04.159> but<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.730> can<00:03:04.879> see<00:03:05.209> right

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
extreme example but you can see right

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.970 
extreme example but you can see right
here<00:03:05.750> that's<00:03:05.930> what<00:03:06.170> I've<00:03:06.290> done<00:03:06.500> with<00:03:06.739> that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
here that's what I've done with that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.160 
here that's what I've done with that
particular<00:03:07.280> photo<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.359> do<00:03:08.629> have<00:03:08.659> a<00:03:08.870> lot<00:03:09.140> of

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
particular photo so you do have a lot of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.440 
particular photo so you do have a lot of
control<00:03:09.680> almost<00:03:10.129> too<00:03:10.459> much<00:03:10.670> control<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.180> this

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
control almost too much control in this

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.930 
control almost too much control in this
case<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.859> definitely<00:03:13.159> want<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.640> change

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
case and I definitely want to change

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.569 
case and I definitely want to change
that<00:03:14.269> but<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.690> 3d<00:03:15.019> print<00:03:15.109> this<00:03:15.650> as<00:03:15.980> well<00:03:16.340> so

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
that but I can 3d print this as well so

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.849 
that but I can 3d print this as well so
that<00:03:16.730> gets<00:03:16.879> to<00:03:17.030> be<00:03:17.060> pretty<00:03:18.019> exciting<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.799> I

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
that gets to be pretty exciting and I

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.009 
that gets to be pretty exciting and I
can<00:03:19.010> always<00:03:19.220> invert<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.239> want<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
can always invert that if I want the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.409 
can always invert that if I want the
buildings<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.500> come<00:03:21.739> out<00:03:21.859> at<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.400> okay

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
buildings to come out at you okay

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.720 
buildings to come out at you okay
but<00:03:23.720> nonetheless<00:03:23.900> going<00:03:24.470> back<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.950> my<00:03:25.130> file<00:03:25.459> in

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
but nonetheless going back to my file in

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.490 
but nonetheless going back to my file in
fact<00:03:26.000> I'm<00:03:26.269> gonna<00:03:26.480> take<00:03:26.780> this<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.169> next

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
fact I'm gonna take this to the next

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.559 
fact I'm gonna take this to the next
level<00:03:27.769> because<00:03:27.889> what<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.250> can<00:03:28.459> do<00:03:28.609> now<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:29.030> I<00:03:29.389> can

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
level because what I can do now is I can

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.390 
level because what I can do now is I can

select this scene and for this entire
scene<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.660> print<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.500> out<00:03:33.709> okay<00:03:34.220> so<00:03:34.280> I'm

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
scene I can print it out okay so I'm

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.550

import<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:06.260> more<00:04:06.799> complex<00:04:07.519> file<00:04:08.209> okay<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:08.840> this

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
import a more complex file okay so this

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.220 
import a more complex file okay so this
is<00:04:09.680> another<00:04:09.799> 3d<00:04:10.489> model<00:04:10.879> that<00:04:11.419> has<00:04:11.599> multiple

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
parts and happens to be a scan okay

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.310 
parts and happens to be a scan okay
yes<00:04:15.349> very<00:04:15.650> self-serving<00:04:16.280> scan<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.320> yours

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
yes very self-serving scan of yours

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.039 
yes very self-serving scan of yours
truly<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.160> again<00:04:19.940> this<00:04:20.060> is<00:04:20.239> my<00:04:20.359> pin<00:04:20.630> holder

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
truly and I again this is my pin holder

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.469 
truly and I again this is my pin holder
but<00:04:21.260> I've<00:04:21.500> composited<00:04:22.460> multiple<00:04:22.940> objects

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
but I've composited multiple objects

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.659 
but I've composited multiple objects
together<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.710> I'd<00:04:24.830> want<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.190> do<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.520> these

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
together so what I'd want to do in these

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:26.410 
together so what I'd want to do in these

flex cases is print this out but really

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.510 
flex cases is print this out but really
I<00:04:29.780> want<00:04:29.930> to<00:04:30.050> take<00:04:30.260> all<00:04:30.440> these<00:04:30.590> various<00:04:30.950> meshes

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
I want to take all these various meshes

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.480 
I want to take all these various meshes
and<00:04:32.440> she<00:04:33.440> could<00:04:33.530> always<00:04:33.650> do<00:04:33.830> is<00:04:33.980> pack<00:04:34.250> those

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
and she could always do is pack those

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.760 
and she could always do is pack those
objects<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.360> ground<00:04:35.660> plane<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:36.590> if<00:04:36.680> you

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
objects on the ground plane so if you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.220 
objects on the ground plane so if you
have<00:04:36.860> an<00:04:37.010> object<00:04:37.220> or<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.060> model<00:04:38.720> that's<00:04:38.870> made<00:04:39.080> up

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
have an object or a model that's made up

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.860 
have an object or a model that's made up
of<00:04:39.350> multiple<00:04:39.590> objects<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.820> can<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.690> not

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
of multiple objects you can you know not

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.210 
of multiple objects you can you know not
only<00:04:41.900> move<00:04:42.260> everything<00:04:42.590> onto<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.010> ground

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
only move everything onto the ground

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.010 
only move everything onto the ground
plane<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:43.730> pack<00:04:43.940> all<00:04:44.150> those<00:04:44.270> objects<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.780> the

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
plane but pack all those objects on the

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.390 
plane but pack all those objects on the
ground<00:04:45.230> plane<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.530> can<00:04:45.650> see<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.860> spread<00:04:46.250> it

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
ground plane you can see it spread it

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.400 
ground plane you can see it spread it
spread<00:04:46.970> those<00:04:47.330> out<00:04:47.480> I<00:04:47.780> could<00:04:47.960> rotate<00:04:48.080> that

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
spread those out I could rotate that

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.380 
spread those out I could rotate that
around<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:48.980> see<00:04:49.190> what<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.430> looks<00:04:49.700> like

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
around you can see what that looks like

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.030 
around you can see what that looks like
but<00:04:50.660> essentially<00:04:51.200> that's<00:04:51.410> what's<00:04:51.620> going<00:04:51.890> on

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
but essentially that's what's going on

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.860 
but essentially that's what's going on
there<00:04:52.310> is<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:53.030> putting<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.450> all<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.840> one

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
there is it's putting it all on one

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.600 
there is it's putting it all on one
plane<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.440> print<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:54.830> out<00:04:54.890> and<00:04:55.100> then<00:04:55.220> put<00:04:55.490> it

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
plane I can print it out and then put it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.580 
plane I can print it out and then put it
together<00:04:55.790> myself<00:04:56.240> rather<00:04:56.810> than<00:04:57.080> having<00:04:57.320> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
together myself rather than having to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.190 
together myself rather than having to
manually<00:04:58.220> do<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.670> alright<00:04:59.660> so<00:04:59.840> going<00:05:00.020> back

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
manually do that alright so going back

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.180 
manually do that alright so going back
into<00:05:00.440> our<00:05:00.920> print<00:05:01.640> settings<00:05:02.830> it's<00:05:03.830> going<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.070> be

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
into our print settings it's going to be

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.770 
into our print settings it's going to be
pretty<00:05:04.370> large<00:05:04.640> but<00:05:05.000> we<00:05:05.120> will<00:05:05.360> click<00:05:05.570> this

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
pretty large but we will click this

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.220 
pretty large but we will click this
print<00:05:06.110> button<00:05:06.410> right<00:05:06.650> down<00:05:06.680> here<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:08.870> will<00:05:09.020> do

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
print button right down here it will do

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.310 
print button right down here it will do
all<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.620> magic<00:05:09.950> that<00:05:10.220> we<00:05:10.490> need<00:05:10.670> it<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.320> making

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
all that magic that we need it to making

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.130 
all that magic that we need it to making
sure<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.010> walls<00:05:13.730> are<00:05:14.090> thick<00:05:14.390> enough<00:05:14.420> for<00:05:15.020> each

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
sure the walls are thick enough for each

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.980 
sure the walls are thick enough for each
one<00:05:15.410> of<00:05:15.500> these<00:05:15.650> objects<00:05:16.480> making<00:05:17.480> them<00:05:17.750> one

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
one of these objects making them one

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
solid mesh repairing those meshes all

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.840 
solid mesh repairing those meshes all
right<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:23.780> here<00:05:23.990> we<00:05:24.110> are<00:05:24.280> looks<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.490> little<00:05:25.610> bit

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
right and here we are looks a little bit

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.390 
right and here we are looks a little bit
different<00:05:26.270> as<00:05:26.420> you'll<00:05:26.780> notice<00:05:27.020> in<00:05:27.650> fact<00:05:28.130> a<00:05:28.250> lot

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
different as you'll notice in fact a lot

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.070 
different as you'll notice in fact a lot
of<00:05:28.520> times<00:05:28.730> you'll<00:05:28.940> see<00:05:29.150> this<00:05:29.300> orange<00:05:29.630> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
of times you'll see this orange and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.290 
of times you'll see this orange and
that's<00:05:30.260> basically<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.040> raft<00:05:31.340> so<00:05:31.790> we'll<00:05:32.090> print

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
that's basically the raft so we'll print

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.000 
that's basically the raft so we'll print
out<00:05:32.390> that<00:05:32.450> plane<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.560> just<00:05:33.830> make<00:05:33.980> sure

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
out that plane and just make sure

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.280 
out that plane and just make sure
everything<00:05:34.490> will<00:05:34.670> print<00:05:34.970> in<00:05:35.120> place<00:05:35.450> it<00:05:36.110> also

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
everything will print in place it also

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.830 
everything will print in place it also
adds<00:05:36.680> this<00:05:37.400> scaffolding<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:38.510> I'll<00:05:38.570> turn<00:05:38.750> off

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
adds this scaffolding so I'll turn off

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.400 
adds this scaffolding so I'll turn off
the<00:05:38.870> raft

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
the raft

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.200 
the raft
that's<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.250> scaffolding<00:05:40.760> which<00:05:40.910> is<00:05:41.060> the

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
that's the scaffolding which is the

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.120 
that's the scaffolding which is the
orange<00:05:41.690> because<00:05:41.990> I<00:05:42.020> can't<00:05:42.350> start<00:05:42.590> printing<00:05:42.980> my

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
orange because I can't start printing my

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.030 
orange because I can't start printing my
hand<00:05:43.430> in<00:05:43.760> midair<00:05:44.360> but<00:05:45.350> not<00:05:45.530> only<00:05:45.650> that<00:05:45.890> i'm

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
hand in midair but not only that i'm

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.370 
hand in midair but not only that i'm
easily<00:05:46.250> previewing<00:05:47.060> this<00:05:47.240> notice<00:05:48.020> how<00:05:48.140> i<00:05:48.170> can

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
easily previewing this notice how i can

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.350 
easily previewing this notice how i can
see<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.680> size<00:05:48.920> i<00:05:49.400> can<00:05:49.550> also<00:05:49.700> see<00:05:49.970> the<00:05:50.090> various

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
see the size i can also see the various

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.270 
see the size i can also see the various
shadows<00:05:50.990> added<00:05:51.410> as<00:05:51.530> well<00:05:51.560> just<00:05:51.920> to<00:05:52.010> give<00:05:52.130> me<00:05:52.250> a

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
shadows added as well just to give me a

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.370 
shadows added as well just to give me a
good<00:05:52.460> idea<00:05:52.820> of<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.510> size<00:05:53.750> of<00:05:53.930> this<00:05:54.080> and

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
good idea of the size of this and

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.250 
good idea of the size of this and
there's<00:05:54.500> also<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:55.060> raytrace<00:05:56.090> preview<00:05:56.930> that

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
there's also the raytrace preview that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.600 
there's also the raytrace preview that
you<00:05:57.410> could<00:05:57.560> turn<00:05:57.710> on<00:05:57.890> as<00:05:58.100> well<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.280> get<00:05:58.550> a

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
you could turn on as well to get a

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.280 
you could turn on as well to get a
clearer<00:05:58.880> representation<00:05:59.840> of<00:05:59.960> what's<00:06:00.140> going

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
clearer representation of what's going

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.940 
clearer representation of what's going
on<00:06:00.530> otherwise<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.700> is<00:06:01.910> WebGL<00:06:02.870> now<00:06:03.650> there<00:06:03.860> are

on otherwise it is WebGL now there are

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.340 
on otherwise it is WebGL now there are
other<00:06:04.130> features<00:06:04.370> in<00:06:04.790> terms<00:06:05.030> of<00:06:05.270> 3d<00:06:05.690> printing
