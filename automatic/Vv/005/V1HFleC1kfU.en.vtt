00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.409
 colleagues in 1 side of the order entered

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.499
 main major goods from the republic 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.470
 Moldova 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.119
 until today have not been presented 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 in our opinion convincing arguments 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.629
 which would confirm as an introduction 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.460
 mess we never were opponents 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.940

 cooperation and on the problem are created 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.670
 not due to retaliatory and defensive 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.000
 measures of the Russian Federation in connection with 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.190
 the fact that our partners do not consider it necessary

 all risks that arise for 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.280
 Russian economy and for other countries 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 Commonwealth we believe that the agreement on

 creating a free trade zone between 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.280
 Republic of Moldova and the European Union 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.549
 should not negatively affect our 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.320
 ties with cis countries on the contrary we 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.600
 we presume that those two 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.729

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.560
