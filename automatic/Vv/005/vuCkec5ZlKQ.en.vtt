00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 hello to all the kids good wednesday 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.509
 from lyngby for tokyo today we talk about the 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.330
 755 entitled a world of men 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.340
 a chapter I have to say enough 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.049
 fun maybe one of the most fun 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599
 for some time now that he has 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.190
 introduced a lot of funny characters 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.750
 and in any case that overall is me 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.670
 liked it quite so as a vote 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 overall I would give him a 7 with a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920
 exceptional chapter but a good chapter 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.140
 and that also leaves this as always or 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.699
 from styl many questions about which 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.679
 I also want to know a little about yours 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.690
 opinion then starting immediately from 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 mini adventures and talking 10 seconds 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.820
 let's see how there is the encounter with the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.590
 cat of sea insomma the same cat of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.040
 sea ​​of ​​the species we have already seen 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 from enough even if it is still early for 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.860
 try to think things over 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.870
 kind on my adventures because we are 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.539
 only at the beginning there is not even the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 title so I would leave mine behind 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.010
 adventures go and talk right away to 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 juice of the chapter then chapter 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 obviously divided into three phases of which 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 the central one is definitely the phase 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 main one that involved communist 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.850
 one of the mugiwara that reveals so many 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 new aspects of his personality that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.040
 we didn't know but first I want to say two 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.470
 words on cangero here is not found a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.350
 a little weird guys is the fact that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 cangiullo that has these powers precisely 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 that allow him to escape like this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.430
 easily not escaped from before 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.979
 only or better, the fact seems strange to me 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.659
 that he is so in perfect health not 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.579
 seems to have not even a scratch 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.520
 so all this time or managed to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.860
 escape perhaps to create a dimension 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.579
 inside the landfill for which it is 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.119
 managed to say so to hide from 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.799
 all the agents of the digos family o 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.020
 however there is something below here I do not 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.939
 I think he's a traitor 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 absolutely not the type though 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.649
 that's if you think about it a little strange 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 that he is so perfect condition e 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.500
 we have not used his powers before in 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 somehow let me know a little about you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 how do you think about this question between 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.030
 the other the drawn stairs 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.160
 duck angel will come into history as 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.050
 the worst scales in the history of 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.060
 Oriental comic strip but moving forward 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.920
 let's talk a little bit about the phase 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 central of the chapter which is what 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 Frank's main character is the clash 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.560
 with Mr. pink the factory etc. 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.810
 here are two notes on the character of 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600
 frankie then the first note is that 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.880
 relative his hearing we discover 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.520
 be an innate ability that I don't 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.980
 seems to have been shown before doda 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.930
 let me know if I'm wrong in the comments 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.280
 maybe if this had already been mentioned 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.100
 I honestly don't remember 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.530
 of this unique super of francs he has 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.770
 however with an innate ability and the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.130
 second of the second aspect is that 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.510
 relative to a little bit we say 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.190
 always to the aspect of sexuality of 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 bis language on which I also did a 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.940
 then a new video emerged 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.920
 aspect of the character of frankie that 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.930
 we all knew how the il 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.180
 perverted in quotes for his 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.220
 habit of showing off underwear but not 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.280
 We knew under this aspect then 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.410
 the seducer and alas the poor sages who 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.620
 would have much to learn from frankie 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.299
 as shown in this chapter here 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.549
 among other things, the character here in 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.400
 this is this girl of twenty 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.470
 we can weigh huge here is that proves 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.480
 surely more years left to me 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.239
 immediately particularly nice for both 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.650
 the way he fights using 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.390
 that kind of vacuum cleaner either 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 precisely because I find it so funny 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.070
 aesthetically and the curtain with 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.230
 Frankie definitely was one of the most 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.310
 funny of the last chapters up to 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.049
 this part is also one of the moments 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.640
 more we say of the highest peaks for 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.560
 regarding sexuality in one 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.830
 piece we know very well how or from 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.959
 always try to treat these little 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.630
 arguments in his manga is not there is not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.140
 never treated sexuality in all 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.700
 its aspects and always very much 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.890
 let's say put aside also respect 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.140
 to other showmen so think about it also 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.820
 simple kiss between frankie and queen is 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.829
 was deliberately censored 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.810
 by the author who shows only the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.040
 nape of the shoulders however it was 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.130
 definitely one of the moments more 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.510
 particular and funny I think of all one 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.340
 piece until this moment that I had 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.440
 as a protagonist frankie by the way 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.859
 here it seems that the fight is finally 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.780
 to reach the culmination of the final table 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.120
 with the diaper bomb against the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.330
 laser nipple is worth only 7 per 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.419
 chapter then a round of applause by itself like 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.599
 I repeat a very funny chapter 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.240
 speaking a little bit of the sentence 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.950
 of the final phase here we have 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.620
 an opportunity to see as usual 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.289
 characters like bartolomeo be a fan 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.820
 boy or usopp do the cagasotto again 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.789
 so nothing new from this point 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.330
 of sight the novelty is precisely that it seems 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.729
 that violet was able to identify the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.470
 princess maceri that according to the network 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.610
 in which is how we find out about the end of the chapter is 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.440
 prisoner we do not say not in the 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.479
 factory as we have seen but 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.190
 in the royal palace and the very sentence 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.520
 interesting that there was enrico there is 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.039
 what its power is useful both for 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 do flamengo that for them then for 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.280
 this reason is sure he will have to mingo 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.830
 it won't hurt her just because 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.970
 last now, of course, click here 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.919
 relations 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.060
 I want to know how you feel about it 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.370
 regarding the power of the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.200
 princess to be born that precisely to the name 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.490
 which in French means is a 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.380
 appellation means my dear e 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.630
 especially what will be the role of leo 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.220
 which seemed to say to have come to 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.130
 term after the blows taken from the tea 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.390
 rebel and instead will probably have a 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.070
 fundamental role precisely for the 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.550
 liberation of the princess and who knows 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.680
 for the future also as regards 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.770
 the relationship with the crew is usually 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.599
 when a character fights together 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.700
 to the modular inside a saga then 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:55.770
 there are possibilities that this 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.800
 can or get into shape or otherwise 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.570
 have a closer relationship with i 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.700
 protagonists happened with brooke from 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.110
 thriller bark happened with bible 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.970
 from which it has not entered 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.740
 shape but we all know what kind of 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.409
 relationship with or with ginger fish man 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.720
 island so pay attention to the character 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.130
 of leo because at this point he could 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.110
 give us surprises I don't want to say that 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:19.960
 get in shape but it could become 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.580
 and he as a bartolomeo an ally in time 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.530
 indeterminate so I think that to this 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.450
 point the main suspects are 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.060
 them two regarding this saga 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.840
 leo and bartolomea let me know how the 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.190
 also think about this circumstance 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.770
 for all the rest as usual 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.930
 useful info item below let me 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.970
 know how you think about it in the chapter 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.120
 below with a comment from the video and us 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.250
 see for 756 in a week 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.690
 so next Wednesday 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.650
 a salute to all the boys and to the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.650
 next on stage
