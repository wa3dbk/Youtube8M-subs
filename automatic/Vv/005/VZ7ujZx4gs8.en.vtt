00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.500 
teeny foot for the bolt that you see
down<00:00:47.319> here<00:00:47.769> in<00:00:48.280> fact<00:00:48.579> there's<00:00:48.819> a<00:00:48.879> piece<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.239> a

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
bulbous down in there now but basically

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.500 
bulbous down in there now but basically
we<00:00:53.920> bring<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.309> around<00:00:54.399> here<00:00:54.819> so<00:00:54.999> that<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.300> can

see what the hang-up was is the wires
for<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.729> back<00:01:00.999> of<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.300> projector<00:01:01.870> headlight

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
for the back of the projector headlight

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.520 
for the back of the projector headlight
case<00:01:02.620> that<00:01:02.889> you<00:01:02.979> see<00:01:03.190> here<00:01:03.639> when<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.690> look<00:01:05.379> at

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
case that you see here when you look at

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.980 
case that you see here when you look at
the<00:01:05.650> back<00:01:05.830> side<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.190> it<00:01:06.520> where<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.420> protrudes

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
the back side of it where it protrudes

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.080 
the back side of it where it protrudes
there<00:01:08.350> wasn't<00:01:08.680> room<00:01:08.860> for<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.310> here<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.850> was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
there wasn't room for it here it was

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.969 
there wasn't room for it here it was
chewing<00:01:10.479> on<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.780> wires<00:01:10.990> I<00:01:11.229> have<00:01:11.590> had<00:01:11.860> it

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
chewing on the wires I have had it

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.459 
chewing on the wires I have had it
intermittently<00:01:12.280> shorting<00:01:13.149> it's<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.259> bad

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
intermittently shorting it's just a bad

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.990 
intermittently shorting it's just a bad
situation<00:01:15.149> so<00:01:16.149> what<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.450> did<00:01:16.600> is<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:18.430> cut<00:01:18.729> out<00:01:18.789> a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
situation so what I did is I cut out a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.859 
situation so what I did is I cut out a
piece<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.420> metal<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.680> can't<00:01:20.950> really<00:01:21.219> tell<00:01:21.460> now

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
piece of metal you can't really tell now

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700 
piece of metal you can't really tell now
but<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:24.549> I<00:01:24.579> did<00:01:24.939> is<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.210> took<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.539> die<00:01:25.990> cut<00:01:26.560> off

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
but what I did is I took the die cut off

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.889 
but what I did is I took the die cut off
tool<00:01:26.950> yeah<00:01:27.729> they<00:01:27.939> kept<00:01:28.149> kind<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.600> triangle

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
tool yeah they kept kind of a triangle

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.319 
tool yeah they kept kind of a triangle
piece<00:01:29.320> out<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.710> here<00:01:29.920> you<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.850> how<00:01:31.090> that

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
piece out of here you can see how that

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.840 
piece out of here you can see how that
this<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.840> shaped<00:01:32.170> out<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.590> way<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.700> the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
this is shaped out that way this is the

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.480 
this is shaped out that way this is the
piece<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.090> I<00:01:34.359> cut<00:01:34.689> from<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
piece that I cut from it and that

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.929 
piece that I cut from it and that
cutting<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.450> out<00:01:38.219> enabled<00:01:39.219> me<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.430> be<00:01:39.670> able<00:01:39.759> to

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
cutting it out enabled me to be able to

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.179 
cutting it out enabled me to be able to
make<00:01:40.060> rim<00:01:40.359> so<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:40.990> fit<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.350> properly<00:01:41.619> so

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
make rim so that it fit in properly so

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.649 
make rim so that it fit in properly so
that<00:01:42.219> it<00:01:42.430> would<00:01:42.549> aim<00:01:42.789> properly<00:01:43.119> and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
that it would aim properly and

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.349 
that it would aim properly and
everything<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.320> just<00:01:44.350> worked<00:01:44.710> nice<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:46.179> other

and<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.070> slid<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.670> along<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.060> back<00:01:58.509> end<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:59.049> it

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
and I slid it along the back end of it

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.289 
and I slid it along the back end of it
and<00:01:59.439> after<00:02:00.070> slitting<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.789> fit<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.149> in<00:02:01.270> there

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
and after slitting it I fit it in there

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.069 
and after slitting it I fit it in there
I<00:02:01.689> filed<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.950> little<00:02:03.340> rasp<00:02:04.179> half-smile

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
I filed it with a little rasp half-smile

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.289 
I filed it with a little rasp half-smile
to<00:02:05.469> get<00:02:05.710> us<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.130> was<00:02:06.189> smoother<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.090> was

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
to get us that it was smoother it was

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.999 
to get us that it was smoother it was
still<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.570> crap<00:02:08.020> even<00:02:08.380> knew<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.860> was

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
still just crap even knew that that was

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.160 
still just crap even knew that that was
gonna<00:02:09.160> wind<00:02:09.460> up<00:02:09.610> free<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.000> some<00:02:10.210> wires<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.110> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
gonna wind up free in some wires so I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.470 
gonna wind up free in some wires so I
laid<00:02:11.409> in<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.769> tubing<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.519> make<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
laid in that tubing to make it so that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.900 
laid in that tubing to make it so that
would<00:02:13.810> just<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.170> better<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.159> next<00:02:15.190> thing<00:02:15.670> that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
would just be better the next thing that

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.350 
would just be better the next thing that
doing<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.540> I'm<00:02:17.350> going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.620> go<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.150> take<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
doing is I'm going to go and take that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.930 
doing is I'm going to go and take that
bracket<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.580> I've<00:02:21.730> already

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
bracket that I have that I've already

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.820 
bracket that I have that I've already
fabricated<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.080> I'm<00:02:23.140> gonna<00:02:23.230> screw<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.560> into

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
fabricated and I'm gonna screw it into

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.060 
fabricated and I'm gonna screw it into
this<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.310> cut<00:02:24.580> off<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:25.330> plastic

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
this I cut off the little plastic

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.430 
this I cut off the little plastic
nonsense<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.370> was<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:27.820> from<00:02:28.090> casting<00:02:28.750> it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
nonsense that was there from casting it

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.650 
nonsense that was there from casting it
is<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.800> thin<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.370> wobbly<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.240> wasn't<00:02:31.570> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
is so thin and so wobbly it wasn't the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
is so thin and so wobbly it wasn't the
right<00:02:31.780> material<00:02:32.320> for<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> bracket<00:02:33.160> makes<00:02:33.820> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
right material for a bracket makes a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.700 
right material for a bracket makes a
good<00:02:34.090> head<00:02:34.330> light<00:02:34.510> case<00:02:34.870> but<00:02:35.170> not<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.380> very<00:02:35.650> good

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
good head light case but not a very good

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.330 
good head light case but not a very good
bracket<00:02:36.340> case<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> I'm<00:02:38.500> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.740> do<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.070> and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
bracket case so I'm going to do that and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.880 
bracket case so I'm going to do that and
that<00:02:39.520> will<00:02:39.640> space<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.300> out<00:02:40.600> so<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.770> will

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
that will space this out so that it will

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.270 
that will space this out so that it will
be<00:02:41.950> secured<00:02:42.490> at<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> bottom<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.150> well<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
be secured at the bottom as well and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.190 
be secured at the bottom as well and
then<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.270> how<00:02:46.300> nice<00:02:46.630> that's<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.140> to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
then you see how nice that's going to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.800 
then you see how nice that's going to
fit<00:02:47.380> now<00:02:47.620> before<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.490> best<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:49.000> could<00:02:49.240> get<00:02:49.600> was

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
fit now before the best I could get was

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.560 
fit now before the best I could get was
like<00:02:49.990> that<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.250> securing<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.420> then

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
like that you know securing it and then

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.230 
like that you know securing it and then
bracket<00:02:53.440> broke<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.040> wobble<00:02:54.460> so<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.210> that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
bracket broke and it wobble so now that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.330 
bracket broke and it wobble so now that
should<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.780> really<00:02:56.080> nice<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.890> other<00:02:57.070> thing

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
should be really nice the other thing

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.700 
should be really nice the other thing
that<00:02:57.370> I've<00:02:57.580> done<00:02:57.730> while<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:57.970> was<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.300> here<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.930> I

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
that I've done while I was in here is I

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.810 
that I've done while I was in here is I
really<00:03:00.400> didn't<00:03:00.790> care<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:02.430> learn<00:03:03.430> how<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.640> use

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
really didn't care for learn how to use

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.660 
really didn't care for learn how to use
this<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.240> locks<00:03:04.480> up<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.110> okay<00:03:05.650> then<00:03:06.640> i

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
this that locks up like that okay then i

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.450 
this that locks up like that okay then i
got--whoo<00:03:06.880> this<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.660> nice<00:03:08.370> digging<00:03:09.370> this

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
got--whoo this is nice digging this

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.170 
got--whoo this is nice digging this
tripod<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.560> see<00:03:12.550> if<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.760> can<00:03:12.910> even<00:03:13.150> zoom

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
tripod but the see if we can even zoom

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.720 
tripod but the see if we can even zoom
bear<00:03:13.990> with<00:03:14.230> me<00:03:15.360> no<00:03:16.360> we're<00:03:16.690> all<00:03:16.780> zoomed<00:03:17.080> in<00:03:17.260> so

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
bear with me no we're all zoomed in so

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.860 
bear with me no we're all zoomed in so
any<00:03:18.730> with<00:03:18.910> other<00:03:19.060> thing<00:03:19.270> that<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.660> took<00:03:19.720> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
any with other thing that is I took a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530 
any with other thing that is I took a
bunch<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.230> loom<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.190> put<00:03:21.430> loom<00:03:21.700> all<00:03:22.090> over

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
bunch of loom and I put loom all over

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.199 
bunch of loom and I put loom all over
all<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.020> wiring<00:03:23.490> things<00:03:24.490> that<00:03:24.760> go<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.000> this

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
all the wiring things that go to this

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.060 
all the wiring things that go to this
and<00:03:25.840> also<00:03:26.020> made<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:26.740> you<00:03:26.890> can

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
and also made it so that you can

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.800 
and also made it so that you can
disconnect<00:03:27.610> them<00:03:27.880> i<00:03:28.000> had<00:03:28.180> them<00:03:28.300> hardwired

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
disconnect them i had them hardwired

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.470 
disconnect them i had them hardwired
before<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:30.040> looked<00:03:30.310> like<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.550> bird<00:03:30.940> nest<00:03:31.270> of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
before and it looked like a bird nest of

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.180 
before and it looked like a bird nest of
wire<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:32.140> back<00:03:32.350> there<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.680> looked<00:03:32.890> horrible

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
wire just back there it looked horrible

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.580 
wire just back there it looked horrible
i<00:03:33.670> was<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:34.090> really<00:03:34.420> embarrassed<00:03:34.570> I<00:03:35.200> know

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
i was just really embarrassed I know

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.350 
i was just really embarrassed I know
what<00:03:35.770> nobody<00:03:36.100> could<00:03:36.310> see<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.030> I<00:03:37.060> didn't

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
what nobody could see it but I didn't

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.000 
what nobody could see it but I didn't
want<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.540> do<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> video<00:03:37.930> on<00:03:38.140> how<00:03:38.320> to<00:03:38.530> do<00:03:38.770> any<00:03:38.920> of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
want to do a video on how to do any of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.760 
want to do a video on how to do any of
this<00:03:39.220> until<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.910> was<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.780> with<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
this until that was right so with the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.590 
this until that was right so with the
lumen<00:03:42.220> place<00:03:42.490> some<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> Loom<00:03:43.240> I<00:03:43.360> pulled

dry<00:04:14.020> I<00:04:14.500> bolted<00:04:15.220> this<00:04:15.670> bracket<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:17.049> point

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
dry I bolted this bracket to the point

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.800 
dry I bolted this bracket to the point
on<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.919> vehicle<00:04:18.190> where<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.850> needed<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.359> be<00:04:19.480> and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
then once it was in place I used a tool

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.730 
then once it was in place I used a tool
to<00:04:24.550> score<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.180> headlight<00:04:25.750> casing<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.470> soft
