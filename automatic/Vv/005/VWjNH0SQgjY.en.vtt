00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.150
 for the second part of the video I'm in 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.430
 I am growing so wept with 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.670
 my contacts so I have many of the 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.410
 friendships that will help me in the next 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.700
 projects 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.630
 this is the second part of the video 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.180
 of the second and last hydraulic turbine 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.330
 part of the design then the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.280
 tutorial the tutorial on how to make it 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.340
 and then recreating another video on the 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.730
 real and proper hydraulic operation 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.700
 so this is the tree we fix the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.060
 last time with pulley is the 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.340
 bearing so I have already set is 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:47.660
 this turbine the turbine this is the 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.960
 caria the turbine and that's all 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.600
 the piece we act the main component 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.190
 that from here will pass to water not allowed 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.960
 anti-rust because there is no such thing 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.690
 that I realized it was only the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.309
 minimum galvanized so it is not iron and not 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.840
 it will rust but I've never been 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:09.859
 protective dumb polish let's say and i have 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.149
 fixed this bracket where we will go to 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:18.649
 connect this risk engine put a 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.100
 collar that I saved the threads and is 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.130
 connected to the led 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.969
 so let's go and position ours 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.969
 engine 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:36.679
 let's put it in parallel to the belt but 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:41.950
 it had to be his plan of dirigisme 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.950
 by eye here 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.700
 here once fixed then we should 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.500
 have a spring that works the belt 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.880
 of transmission 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:09.090
 in this way, here and when we go 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:11.800
 to turn the turbine will turn on the led 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.500
 after you will ask you something then 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.280
 follow the video which will be a good thing 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:24.310
 both for you and for me then we go to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:28.810
 mount the turbine so here is the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.480
 nut is here there are these type blocks 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.700
 that should be put here to keep it from going 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.750
 more behind the turbine and therefore once 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.300
 michelle from dr 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.270
 will go completely fixed against 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:46.810
 the tree we insert the turbine in the center 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.630
 here and we put the nut that must be guided 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.630
 on the contrary because they are mobile objects 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.610
 it was forbidden and to the contrary 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.390
 ok so let's see that by moving this yes 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.340
 it also moves the turbine and moves 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.380
 at the same time I don't have a cable tie 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.090
 available because we could not mount 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.000
 the bird now this is the tube o 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 in the final agreement they did one 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.360
 20 liter carboy with the sack 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.060
 suitably modified to have 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.269
 this hard life and therefore this augello 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.019
 been from the previous turbines 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.360
 here and where I made two conquering holes 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.959
 there is no strap and therefore you can 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.269
 block it higher will be put on 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.920
 the more water the container will be 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:57.160
 pressure is then here and are two holes of 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:00.040
 toe drain had to come out to water one 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:07.060
 once done this you can connect the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:13.030
 belt let the water pass then 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:19.209
 move everything then moving but then 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:21.729
 we will pass the led will activate the led and it is 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.680
 here that ends this other part 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:29.830
 of the videos is not if you will have a 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.060
 12 volt transformer two events that do not 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.529
 you need to be working because 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.639
 I want to connect the pure 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:43.189
 the speaker at a transformer who 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.259
 I hope you can help me on 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.989
 exchange can give all the pieces of the 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.509
 turbine with the engine 

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:52.999
 if I need also what generated one 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.709
 so there is a lot of components that me 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:57.699
 will serve for this project from 

00:04:54.709 --> 00:05:02.509
 make the crankshaft components 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:05.329
 cute and urbino bearings so can 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.729
 also realize a project thing there 

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:09.709
 we can find some parts then there 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.369
 we fight through youtube on mine 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:15.639
 channel tried to let me know 

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:18.859
 Hi, I'll show you all 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:24.199
 update to the next video on how 

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:27.009
 it really works without it with air 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.009
 if I blow 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:34.399
 we see that it turns so I will see the 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:37.249
 real hydraulic operation 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:38.059
 so follow me and join us there 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:40.629
 the new ones 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.629
 Hi everyone
