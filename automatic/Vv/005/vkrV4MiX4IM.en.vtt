that they the robust will sort of be
additive<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> they<00:01:59.219> could

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
additive or do you think that they could

additive or do you think that they could
in<00:01:59.579> some<00:01:59.909> ways<00:02:00.180> replace<00:02:00.689> journalists

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
in some ways replace journalists

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
in some ways replace journalists
especially<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.979> know<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.640> imagine<00:02:02.729> 10

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
especially if you know I can imagine 10

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
especially if you know I can imagine 10
years<00:02:03.509> down<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> road<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.350> can<00:02:04.560> build<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
years down the road they can build in

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.389 
years down the road they can build in
biases<00:02:06.290> editorial<00:02:07.290> style<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.340> you

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
biases editorial style so what do you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.100 
biases editorial style so what do you
think<00:02:08.550> will<00:02:08.640> happen<00:02:08.670> maybe<00:02:09.179> 5<00:02:09.660> 10<00:02:09.899> years<00:02:09.929> down

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
think will happen maybe 5 10 years down

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.889 
think will happen maybe 5 10 years down
the<00:02:10.319> road

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
the road

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.300 
the road
that<00:02:11.049> will<00:02:11.290> happen<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.860> think<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.189> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that will happen I think in the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.619 
that will happen I think in the
immediate<00:02:12.670> future<00:02:12.819> there's<00:02:13.150> probably<00:02:13.360> not<00:02:13.599> a

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
immediate future there's probably not a

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.149 
immediate future there's probably not a
big<00:02:13.840> reason<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.230> worry<00:02:14.409> Alyssa<00:02:14.739> because<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
big reason to worry Alyssa because I

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.740 
big reason to worry Alyssa because I
mean<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:16.000> one<00:02:16.120> thing<00:02:16.150> they're<00:02:16.390> replacing

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
mean for one thing they're replacing

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.059 
mean for one thing they're replacing
stories<00:02:17.079> that<00:02:17.230> reporters<00:02:17.620> are<00:02:17.739> already

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
stories that reporters are already

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.740 
stories that reporters are already
basically<00:02:18.280> automating<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.360> they're<00:02:19.510> on

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
basically automating like they're on

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.020 
basically automating like they're on
autopilot<00:02:20.260> anyway<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:20.829> it's<00:02:21.159> deserves<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.939> be

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
autopilot anyway so it's deserves to be

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.119 
autopilot anyway so it's deserves to be
replaced<00:02:22.390> by<00:02:22.569> software<00:02:23.049> but<00:02:23.650> then<00:02:23.829> you<00:02:23.920> take

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
replaced by software but then you take

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.170 
replaced by software but then you take
it<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> step<00:02:24.430> further<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.790> you're<00:02:24.849> like<00:02:25.000> well

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
it a step further and you're like well

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.119 
it a step further and you're like well
what<00:02:25.209> about<00:02:25.540> editorials<00:02:26.439> what<00:02:26.620> about<00:02:26.829> the

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
what about editorials what about the

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.009 
what about editorials what about the
things<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.489> we<00:02:27.609> want<00:02:27.849> a<00:02:28.000> human<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.659> look<00:02:28.870> at

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
things that we want a human to look at

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.899 
things that we want a human to look at
now<00:02:29.439> let's<00:02:29.650> keep<00:02:29.769> in<00:02:29.920> mind<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.250> at<00:02:30.519> places

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
now let's keep in mind that at places

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.640 
now let's keep in mind that at places
like<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.209> AP<00:02:31.450> editors<00:02:31.989> are<00:02:32.140> probably<00:02:32.530> gonna

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
like the AP editors are probably gonna

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.050 
like the AP editors are probably gonna
look<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.069> those<00:02:33.189> stories<00:02:33.489> anyway<00:02:33.819> they're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
look at those stories anyway they're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.130 
look at those stories anyway they're
gonna<00:02:34.180> fact-check<00:02:34.599> them<00:02:34.870> they're<00:02:35.019> gonna

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
gonna fact-check them they're gonna

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
gonna fact-check them they're gonna
polish<00:02:35.590> them<00:02:35.890> they're<00:02:35.980> gonna<00:02:36.129> make<00:02:36.280> sure<00:02:36.459> so

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
polish them they're gonna make sure so

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.940 
polish them they're gonna make sure so
there's<00:02:37.390> still<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.659> human<00:02:37.870> element<00:02:38.200> but<00:02:38.650> you

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
there's still the human element but you

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.220 
there's still the human element but you
are<00:02:39.099> you're<00:02:39.760> getting<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.239> exactly<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.720> point

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
are you're getting it exactly the point

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.780 
are you're getting it exactly the point
and<00:02:41.379> the<00:02:41.470> problem<00:02:41.859> here<00:02:42.010> potentially<00:02:42.519> because

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and the problem here potentially because

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.879 
and the problem here potentially because
right<00:02:43.389> now<00:02:43.569> it's<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.109> financial<00:02:44.500> journalism

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
right now it's just financial journalism

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
where it's just the facts what happens

these machines have you know access to
data<00:02:58.359> and<00:02:58.659> can<00:02:59.109> process<00:02:59.349> data<00:02:59.859> much<00:03:00.189> faster

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
data and can process data much faster

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.849 
data and can process data much faster
than<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.599> can<00:03:01.780> look<00:03:01.930> at<00:03:02.170> trends<00:03:02.470> you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
than we can so I can look at trends you

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.530 
than we can so I can look at trends you
know<00:03:02.889> that's<00:03:03.310> laughs<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.909> trucks<00:03:04.120> like<00:03:04.329> it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
know that's laughs and trucks like it

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.050 
know that's laughs and trucks like it
can<00:03:04.750> look<00:03:04.930> at<00:03:05.200> how<00:03:05.560> particular<00:03:06.220> stocks<00:03:06.879> are

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
can look at how particular stocks are

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.509 
can look at how particular stocks are
performing<00:03:07.659> over<00:03:08.319> vast<00:03:08.769> periods<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.310> times

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
performing over vast periods of times

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:10.740 
performing over vast periods of times
analyze<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.239> data<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.540> give<00:03:10.629> your

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
analyze that data and give your

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.420 
analyze that data and give your
recommendations<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.439> much<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:12.189> difficult

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
recommendations it's much more difficult

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.429 
recommendations it's much more difficult
it<00:03:13.120> can<00:03:13.299> be<00:03:13.359> much<00:03:13.599> more<00:03:13.750> difficult<00:03:13.810> but<00:03:14.260> it's

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
it can be much more difficult but it's

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.740 
it can be much more difficult but it's
definitely<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.220> lot<00:03:15.609> slower<00:03:16.030> when<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.359> human

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
definitely a lot slower when a human

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.439 
definitely a lot slower when a human
does<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.079> yeah<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.620> sure<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.129> and<00:03:18.459> you<00:03:19.060> you

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
does it yeah for sure and and you you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.460 
does it yeah for sure and and you you
raise<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> good<00:03:19.840> point<00:03:19.900> which<00:03:20.169> is<00:03:20.199> that<00:03:20.379> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
raise a good point which is that the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.539 
raise a good point which is that the
software<00:03:20.799> only<00:03:20.889> works<00:03:21.190> through<00:03:21.489> a

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
software only works through a

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.979 
software only works through a
partnership<00:03:21.879> with<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> financial<00:03:22.629> research

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
partnership with a financial research

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.960 
partnership with a financial research
firm<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.620> there's<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.129> lot<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.400> data<00:03:24.519> going<00:03:24.790> on

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
firm so there's a lot of data going on

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.879 
firm so there's a lot of data going on
here<00:03:25.209> now<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.989> think<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.470> will<00:03:26.560> probably<00:03:26.709> only

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
here now I think it will probably only

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.439 
here now I think it will probably only
help<00:03:27.159> because<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.489> want<00:03:27.699> more<00:03:27.940> information

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
help because we want more information

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.369 
help because we want more information
not<00:03:28.599> less<00:03:28.870> but<00:03:29.199> but<00:03:29.949> it<00:03:30.760> also<00:03:31.199> reflects<00:03:32.199> our

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
not less but but it also reflects our

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.140 
not less but but it also reflects our
biases<00:03:32.919> about<00:03:33.099> what<00:03:33.400> journalism<00:03:33.730> should<00:03:33.909> be

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
biases about what journalism should be

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.099 
biases about what journalism should be
and<00:03:34.269> who<00:03:34.389> should<00:03:34.569> be<00:03:34.629> reading<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.019> because

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
and who should be reading it because

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.449 
and who should be reading it because
we're<00:03:35.379> used<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.739> thinking<00:03:35.889> about<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.310> old

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
we're used to thinking about the old

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.920 
we're used to thinking about the old
model<00:03:36.760> where<00:03:36.909> journalism<00:03:37.599> is<00:03:37.720> made

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
model where journalism is made

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.140 
model where journalism is made
responsibly<00:03:38.799> by<00:03:38.980> humans<00:03:39.340> for<00:03:39.519> humans<00:03:39.940> and

million people will be this our model is
the<00:03:53.049> inverse<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.709> we<00:03:54.129> want<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.459> create<00:03:54.639> a

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
getting at is that once you create this

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.520 
getting at is that once you create this
much<00:04:01.150> content<00:04:01.629> you<00:04:01.720> can<00:04:01.840> start<00:04:02.049> start<00:04:02.440> to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
much content you can start start to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.409 
much content you can start start to

specialize it for specific audiences

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.960 
specialize it for specific audiences
people<00:04:05.229> like<00:04:05.409> fantasy<00:04:06.069> football<00:04:06.099> users<00:04:06.819> on

unless<00:04:13.299> there<00:04:13.540> were<00:04:13.629> algorithms<00:04:14.139> writing<00:04:14.500> it

quickly<00:04:16.810> yeah<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.979> could<00:04:18.159> open<00:04:18.370> up

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
quickly yeah so this could open up

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.569 
quickly yeah so this could open up
really<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.630> journalism<00:04:19.959> industry<00:04:20.340> maybe<00:04:21.340> at

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
really the journalism industry maybe at

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.070 
really the journalism industry maybe at
the<00:04:21.700> expense<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.090> some<00:04:22.300> reporters<00:04:22.750> but

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the expense of some reporters but

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.540 
the expense of some reporters but

our<00:04:33.580> natural<00:04:34.000> language<00:04:34.150> stick<00:04:34.569> them<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.810> there

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
our natural language stick them in there

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.749 
our natural language stick them in there
so<00:04:35.139> it's<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.129> me<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.310> absolutely

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
so it's that to me is absolutely

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.240 
so it's that to me is absolutely
fascinating<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:37.720> in<00:04:37.990> some<00:04:38.259> ways<00:04:38.560> we<00:04:38.919> might<00:04:39.099> not

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
fascinating so in some ways we might not

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.860 
fascinating so in some ways we might not
necessarily<00:04:39.370> lose<00:04:39.909> all<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.300> flavor<00:04:40.569> you're

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
necessarily lose all that flavor you're

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.749 
necessarily lose all that flavor you're
saying<00:04:41.110> these<00:04:41.530> reports<00:04:41.979> could<00:04:42.190> actually<00:04:42.430> be

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
saying these reports could actually be

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.309 
saying these reports could actually be
somewhat<00:04:43.180> interesting<00:04:43.720> is<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:43.930> correct

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
somewhat interesting is that correct

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.390 
somewhat interesting is that correct
that's<00:04:44.470> right<00:04:44.590> like<00:04:44.919> when<00:04:45.039> you<00:04:45.129> read<00:04:45.280> these

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
that's right like when you read these

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.619 
that's right like when you read these
reports<00:04:45.580> they<00:04:45.879> won't<00:04:46.030> necessarily<00:04:46.180> be

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
reports they won't necessarily be

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.200 
reports they won't necessarily be
robotronic<00:04:47.289> they<00:04:47.530> won't<00:04:47.710> look<00:04:47.889> like<00:04:48.099> so<00:04:48.370> stiff

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
robotronic they won't look like so stiff

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.939 
robotronic they won't look like so stiff
and<00:04:49.389> lame<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.750> way<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.900> would<00:04:50.080> expect<00:04:50.110> an

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
and lame the way you would expect an

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.439 
and lame the way you would expect an
algorithm<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.400> be<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:51.789> let's<00:04:52.120> remember<00:04:52.300> that

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
algorithm to be but let's remember that

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.999 
algorithm to be but let's remember that
that's<00:04:52.599> because<00:04:52.900> humans<00:04:53.229> are<00:04:53.289> coding<00:04:53.770> their

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
that's because humans are coding their

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.860 
that's because humans are coding their
humor<00:04:54.370> into<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:54.789> software<00:04:55.210> right<00:04:55.509> it's<00:04:55.720> not

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
humor into the software right it's not

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.080 
humor into the software right it's not
like<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.430> algorithm<00:04:57.430> already<00:04:57.699> knows<00:04:57.849> how<00:04:58.030> to

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
like the algorithm already knows how to

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.999 
like the algorithm already knows how to
be<00:04:58.240> funny<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.840> it's<00:04:59.319> not<00:04:59.530> like<00:04:59.650> humans<00:04:59.919> are

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
be funny so it's not like humans are

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.610 
be funny so it's not like humans are
going<00:05:00.280> anywhere<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:00.879> I'm<00:05:01.750> sure<00:05:02.289> Lissette

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
going anywhere but I'm sure Lissette

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.869 
going anywhere but I'm sure Lissette
thought<00:05:02.770> there<00:05:02.889> will<00:05:03.009> always<00:05:03.159> be<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> role<00:05:03.639> for

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879 
thought there will always be a role for

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.020 
thought there will always be a role for
people<00:05:04.509> and<00:05:05.020> style<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.979> tone<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:06.759> all<00:05:06.879> the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
people and style and tone and all the

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.469 
people and style and tone and all the
stuff<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.240> we<00:05:07.449> go<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:09.340> hope<00:05:10.180> they<00:05:10.330> do

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
stuff that we go to I hope they do

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.459 
stuff that we go to I hope they do
because<00:05:10.659> I<00:05:10.719> don't<00:05:10.900> want<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.139> just<00:05:11.259> read<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
because I don't want to just read the

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.339 
because I don't want to just read the
you<00:05:12.190> know<00:05:12.509> computer-generated<00:05:13.509> reports<00:05:14.199> we

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
you know computer-generated reports we

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.360 
you know computer-generated reports we
all<00:05:14.440> want<00:05:14.650> journalism<00:05:15.069> and<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.219> don't<00:05:15.280> think

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
all want journalism and I don't think

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.499 
all want journalism and I don't think
that's<00:05:15.639> going<00:05:15.789> anywhere<00:05:16.120> but<00:05:16.270> what<00:05:16.389> do<00:05:16.449> you

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
that's going anywhere but what do you

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.089 
that's going anywhere but what do you
think<00:05:16.780> do<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:16.900> think<00:05:17.080> this<00:05:17.199> will<00:05:17.319> change<00:05:17.889> what

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
think do you think this will change what

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:19.680 
think do you think this will change what
we<00:05:18.190> see<00:05:18.610> when<00:05:18.819> we<00:05:18.879> go<00:05:18.969> online<00:05:19.180> and<00:05:19.479> when<00:05:19.599> we

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
we see when we go online and when we

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.180 
we see when we go online and when we
read<00:05:19.840> news<00:05:20.050> or<00:05:20.259> is<00:05:20.500> this<00:05:20.860> just<00:05:21.039> going<00:05:21.129> to

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
read news or is this just going to

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.529 
read news or is this just going to
automate<00:05:21.550> some<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.879> stuff<00:05:22.090> that<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.360> don't

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
automate some of the stuff that we don't

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.059 
automate some of the stuff that we don't
really<00:05:22.840> care<00:05:23.110> about<00:05:23.289> that<00:05:23.379> much<00:05:23.530> anyway<00:05:23.889> let
