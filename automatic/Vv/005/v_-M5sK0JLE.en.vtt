00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.200
 this collection program started with a performance and sergio vallín 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.310
 artist who thinks she is a teacher speaks a language that does not appear in the tower 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.600
 babel other artists made history as if the work that puts art between 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.000
 rejas the performance distinguishes us p if it climbs on four legs and gets the life 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.490
 everyday and in the laboratory I keep noticing the artists that are arriving 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.349
 bombings and the bosses along the river 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.720
 rest life is artificial 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.019
 to jazz 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.499
 today we are going to adhere to the program to performance art 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.499
 what is live art signed by artists 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.180
 because in art in general what you know the artist exhibits his work a 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.470
 Once you finish your work hang the box for example and ready but in 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.220
 the case of the performances the artist is also the work 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 but the truth here we are not to define it 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.600
 but to tell the world that performance art 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.790
 has influenced all forms of contemporary art 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 and that's why we believe that it deserves not just a segment of the program but a 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.760
 entire program 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 it is not clear to you what a performance is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.110
 it's true that you're seeing for example p 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.000
 this is a performance a simple but forms another high to be it please 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.680

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:22.689

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.929
 of all that the PSOE have to do with a kind of drive 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:40.509

 and they speak esperanto that they are well 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.599
 a most recent day winner of this idea of ​​trying to leave it 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.849
 general and in fact it became a universal mess that is totally impossible 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.340
 but it was good can

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.610
 in this particular way what I wanted to convey was also 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.379
 of what goes into the speech of the show about what were my 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.009
 influences 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.160

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:08.449
 difficult to predict because 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.449
 but now 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.300
