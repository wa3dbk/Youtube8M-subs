00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
we're just diving into the shallow end

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.039 
we're just diving into the shallow end
of<00:01:44.310> doing<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> now<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:45.329> advice<00:01:45.630> from<00:01:45.840> South

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
of doing it now what advice from South

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
of doing it now what advice from South
Africa<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> lessons<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.460> well<00:01:47.670> in

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
Africa the lessons like and well in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.310 
Africa the lessons like and well in
South<00:01:47.970> Africa<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.420> part<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
South Africa I think part of the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
South Africa I think part of the
challenge<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.770> keeping<00:01:49.950> talent<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.970> know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
challenge is keeping talent be you know

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
challenge is keeping talent be you know
obviously<00:01:51.540> exchange<00:01:52.409> rate<00:01:52.649> etc<00:01:53.220> makes<00:01:53.430> it

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
obviously exchange rate etc makes it

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
obviously exchange rate etc makes it
tough<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.939> us<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.420> think<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
tough for us so I think you know the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
tough for us so I think you know the
unit<00:01:55.770> has<00:01:55.860> been<00:01:55.890> pretty<00:01:56.189> open<00:01:56.369> sending<00:01:57.270> guys

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
unit has been pretty open sending guys

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.990 
unit has been pretty open sending guys
abroad

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
abroad

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.280 
abroad
Japan<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> good<00:02:00.390> example<00:02:00.509> getting<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
Japan is a good example getting the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.469 
Japan is a good example getting the
backboard<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> manager<00:02:02.520> their<00:02:03.030> managers

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
backboard is the manager their managers

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.130 
backboard is the manager their managers
are<00:02:03.689> probably<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> manager<00:02:04.520> but<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> players

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
are probably the manager but the players

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
are probably the manager but the players
have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> negotiation<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:08.369> go<00:02:08.550> across<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
have a negotiation they go across to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.400 
have a negotiation they go across to
Japan<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.720> deal<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.080> I'll<00:02:10.140> come<00:02:10.379> back

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Japan like my deal and I'll come back

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.850 
Japan like my deal and I'll come back
and<00:02:10.679> play<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.099> Stormers<00:02:11.550> so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and play for the Stormers so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.100 
and play for the Stormers so
other<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> worked<00:02:14.390> otherwise<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.870> don't

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
other if it worked otherwise I don't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.570 
other if it worked otherwise I don't
think<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.650> be<00:02:15.680> able<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.070> play<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:16.520> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
think I would be able to play for the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.770 
think I would be able to play for the
store<00:02:16.820> my<00:02:16.940> store<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.210> know<00:02:17.330> probably<00:02:17.600> would

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
store my store you know probably would

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.290 
store my store you know probably would
have<00:02:17.870> been<00:02:17.990> stuck<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.380> Europe<00:02:18.620> somewhere

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
have been stuck in Europe somewhere

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.490 
have been stuck in Europe somewhere
obviously<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.600> know<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> Springboks<00:02:21.260> are<00:02:21.410> up

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
obviously you know the Springboks are up

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.410 
obviously you know the Springboks are up
and<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.740> select<00:02:22.070> players<00:02:22.280> based<00:02:22.610> abroad<00:02:22.850> so

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and I select players based abroad so

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.360 
and I select players based abroad so
it's<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.080> different<00:02:24.380> challenge<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.860> think<00:02:24.950> every

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
it's a different challenge I think every

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.400 
it's a different challenge I think every
every<00:02:25.610> one<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.120> us<00:02:26.330> are<00:02:26.720> unique<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.320> we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
every one of us are unique and we

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.750 
every one of us are unique and we
different<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.920> know<00:02:28.010> New<00:02:28.250> Zealand's<00:02:28.580> got<00:02:28.730> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
different you know New Zealand's got a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
different you know New Zealand's got a
sit<00:02:29.000> way<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:30.080> I'll<00:02:30.230> use<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:30.620> sit<00:02:30.920> way<00:02:31.100> so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
sit way that I'll use go sit way so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.940 
sit way that I'll use go sit way so
whatever<00:02:31.910> makes<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.270> work<00:02:32.420> I<00:02:32.690> suppose<00:02:33.050> how<00:02:33.890> do

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
as for quite a few guys involved in

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.960 
as for quite a few guys involved in
their<00:03:42.170> systems<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:43.550> are<00:03:43.640> they<00:03:43.790> all

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
their systems so we are they all

their systems so we are they all
starting<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.450> work<00:03:44.600> together<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:45.470> think

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
starting to work together and I think

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
players that might be involved on the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.080 
players that might be involved on the
same<00:03:48.830> page<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.670> surprised<00:03:50.060> that

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
same page you you surprised that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.759 
same page you you surprised that
Australia<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.720> not<00:03:50.959> going<00:03:51.260> down<00:03:51.320> their<00:03:51.560> track

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
Australia is not going down their track

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.120 
Australia is not going down their track
New<00:03:51.920> Zealand<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.690> some<00:03:54.260> might<00:03:54.590> say<00:03:54.830> that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
New Zealand is and some might say that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.710 
New Zealand is and some might say that
the<00:03:55.400> Australian<00:03:55.820> doesn't<00:03:56.150> have<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.480> depth

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
the Australian doesn't have the depth

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.850 
the Australian doesn't have the depth
that<00:03:56.810> perhaps<00:03:57.080> South<00:03:57.350> Africa<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.800> New

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
that perhaps South Africa and New

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.860 
that perhaps South Africa and New
Zealand<00:03:58.220> have<00:03:58.310> short<00:03:58.519> injuries<00:03:58.820> come<00:03:59.630> about

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
Zealand have short injuries come about

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.300 
Zealand have short injuries come about
are<00:04:00.080> you<00:04:00.440> surprised<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:00.830> we're<00:04:01.100> not<00:04:01.190> doing

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
are you surprised that we're not doing

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.830 
are you surprised that we're not doing
that<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.700> think<00:04:02.060> injuries<00:04:02.420> you're<00:04:02.570> not<00:04:02.660> going

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
that I think injuries you're not going

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.479 
that I think injuries you're not going
to<00:04:02.900> prevent<00:04:03.230> injuries<00:04:03.590> both<00:04:03.800> but<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.160> think<00:04:04.400> you

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
to prevent injuries both but I think you

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.460 
to prevent injuries both but I think you
might<00:04:04.820> refresh<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.420> player<00:04:05.630> but<00:04:05.870> yeah<00:04:06.170> maybe

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
might refresh the player but yeah maybe

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.530 
might refresh the player but yeah maybe
I<00:04:06.650> know<00:04:06.769> there's<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.190> lot<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.430> players<00:04:07.760> in<00:04:08.030> that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
I know there's a lot of players in that

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.000 
I know there's a lot of players in that
week<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:08.989> two<00:04:09.200> weeks<00:04:09.380> they<00:04:09.530> get<00:04:09.650> off<00:04:09.799> they

do it you know South Africa now for the
I'm<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.840> while<00:04:26.990> actually<00:04:27.500> pulling<00:04:27.740> players

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
I'm in a while actually pulling players

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.580 
I'm in a while actually pulling players
and<00:04:28.400> in<00:04:28.760> having<00:04:29.480> letting<00:04:29.930> them<00:04:30.140> have<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.350> race

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
and in having letting them have a race

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.990 
and in having letting them have a race
so<00:04:30.890> it's<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.160> know<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.550> think<00:04:31.610> it's<00:04:31.850> good

it's a tough challenge for us through a

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.440 
it's a tough challenge for us through a
young<00:05:42.440> side<00:05:42.740> and<00:05:43.070> we<00:05:43.640> also<00:05:43.790> gained<00:05:44.060> through<00:05:44.420> a

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
young side and we also gained through a

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.240 
young side and we also gained through a
bit<00:05:44.630> of<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.780> transition<00:05:45.080> phase<00:05:45.650> in<00:05:45.920> our<00:05:46.040> game

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
bit of a transition phase in our game

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.160 
bit of a transition phase in our game
way<00:05:46.490> you<00:05:47.090> know<00:05:47.210> we're<00:05:47.450> starting<00:05:47.720> to<00:05:47.960> play<00:05:48.140> a

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
way you know we're starting to play a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.690 
way you know we're starting to play a
bit<00:05:48.380> more<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.620> think<00:05:48.680> something<00:05:49.220> similar<00:05:49.460> the

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
bit more I think something similar the

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.150 
bit more I think something similar the
Waratahs<00:05:49.970> a<00:05:50.150> bit<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.390> few<00:05:50.630> years<00:05:50.780> ago<00:05:50.930> so<00:05:51.320> if<00:05:51.920> we

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
Waratahs a bit a few years ago so if we

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.070 
Waratahs a bit a few years ago so if we
play<00:05:52.370> well<00:05:52.580> I<00:05:52.760> think<00:05:53.060> we'll<00:05:53.270> we'll<00:05:53.810> put<00:05:53.990> them

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
play well I think we'll we'll put them

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.450 
play well I think we'll we'll put them
on<00:05:54.170> oppression<00:05:54.620> certain<00:05:54.950> phases<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.430> game

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
on oppression certain phases of the game

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.100 
on oppression certain phases of the game

what does a humble background make of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.690 
what does a humble background make of
that<00:05:57.230> transformation<00:05:57.710> when<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:58.310> guys<00:05:58.430> are

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
involvement of every single play gets a

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.850 
involvement of every single play gets a
lot<00:06:05.060> more<00:06:05.090> and<00:06:05.570> so<00:06:05.960> I've<00:06:06.110> been<00:06:06.260> enjoying<00:06:06.410> it<00:06:06.710> I

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
lot more and so I've been enjoying it I

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.820 
lot more and so I've been enjoying it I
think<00:06:07.100> I'm<00:06:07.250> I'm<00:06:08.120> part<00:06:08.420> of<00:06:08.540> this<00:06:08.660> you<00:06:09.230> know<00:06:09.320> new

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
think I'm I'm part of this you know new

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.590 
think I'm I'm part of this you know new
new<00:06:10.190> phase<00:06:10.490> we're<00:06:10.730> going<00:06:10.910> to<00:06:11.060> be<00:06:11.150> trying<00:06:11.480> to

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
new phase we're going to be trying to

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.230 
new phase we're going to be trying to
play<00:06:11.830> trying<00:06:12.830> to<00:06:12.950> keep<00:06:13.160> up<00:06:13.370> that's<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.090> big

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
play trying to keep up that's the big

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.210 
play trying to keep up that's the big
thing<00:06:14.510> but<00:06:15.260> you<00:06:15.410> know<00:06:15.440> you've<00:06:15.680> got<00:06:15.920> I<00:06:15.950> think

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
thing but you know you've got I think

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.920 
thing but you know you've got I think
all<00:06:16.460> of<00:06:16.490> us<00:06:16.640> strive<00:06:16.940> for<00:06:17.180> balance<00:06:17.390> and<00:06:17.810> you've

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
all of us strive for balance and you've

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.360 
all of us strive for balance and you've
got<00:06:18.050> to<00:06:18.140> get<00:06:18.200> a<00:06:18.260> certain<00:06:18.620> balance<00:06:18.800> in<00:06:19.070> the<00:06:19.190> game

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
got to get a certain balance in the game

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.420 
got to get a certain balance in the game
and<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:20.480> think<00:06:21.410> at<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:21.710> moment<00:06:21.830> our<00:06:22.130> balance

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
and I think at the moment our balance

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.890 
and I think at the moment our balance
not<00:06:22.580> quite<00:06:22.850> perfect<00:06:23.300> but<00:06:23.480> I<00:06:23.510> think<00:06:23.780> it's

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
not quite perfect but I think it's

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.370 
not quite perfect but I think it's
getting<00:06:24.020> better

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
getting better

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.860 
getting better
did<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:24.740> come<00:06:24.800> from<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.570> reassessment<00:06:26.570> of

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
did this come from a reassessment of

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.840 
did this come from a reassessment of
where<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.200> game<00:06:27.380> has<00:06:27.890> got<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:28.520> maybe<00:06:28.670> the

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
where the game has got to and maybe the

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.100 
where the game has got to and maybe the
Stormers<00:06:29.150> looked<00:06:29.360> at<00:06:29.450> I<00:06:29.510> thought<00:06:29.630> we've<00:06:30.080> been

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
Stormers looked at I thought we've been

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.860 
Stormers looked at I thought we've been
fantastic<00:06:31.030> defensively<00:06:32.030> for<00:06:32.270> so<00:06:32.450> many<00:06:32.570> years

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
fantastic defensively for so many years

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.739 
fantastic defensively for so many years
that<00:06:32.990> hasn't<00:06:33.170> won<00:06:33.410> us<00:06:33.560> a<00:06:33.650> title

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:34.749 
that hasn't won us a title

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:37.409 
that hasn't won us a title
did<00:06:35.379> you<00:06:35.499> did<00:06:35.739> you<00:06:35.769> have<00:06:36.009> to<00:06:36.189> evolve<00:06:36.489> I<00:06:36.879> think

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
did you did you have to evolve I think

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.329 
did you did you have to evolve I think
it<00:06:37.809> comes<00:06:38.169> with<00:06:38.379> the<00:06:38.469> era's<00:06:38.709> I<00:06:38.919> think<00:06:39.249> the

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:39.339 
it comes with the era's I think the

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.609 
it comes with the era's I think the
previous<00:06:39.759> generation<00:06:40.479> of<00:06:40.599> storms<00:06:41.049> players<00:06:41.349> we

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:41.619 
previous generation of storms players we

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:43.859 
previous generation of storms players we
were<00:06:41.709> really<00:06:41.919> successful<00:06:42.580> for<00:06:42.610> what<00:06:43.509> we<00:06:43.689> did

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:43.869 
were really successful for what we did

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.569 
were really successful for what we did
back<00:06:44.079> then<00:06:44.289> and<00:06:44.499> I<00:06:44.709> think<00:06:44.769> now<00:06:44.979> if<00:06:45.309> you<00:06:45.429> look

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:45.579 
back then and I think now if you look

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.399 
back then and I think now if you look
back<00:06:45.789> from<00:06:45.969> 2010<00:06:46.509> to<00:06:46.689> now<00:06:46.839> we've<00:06:47.079> only<00:06:47.199> got

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
back from 2010 to now we've only got

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:48.899 
back from 2010 to now we've only got
three<00:06:47.589> players<00:06:47.829> left<00:06:48.069> in<00:06:48.279> the<00:06:48.369> storm<00:06:48.610> scripts

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
three players left in the storm scripts

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.339 
three players left in the storm scripts
there's<00:06:49.149> a<00:06:49.179> whole<00:06:49.329> new<00:06:49.479> generation<00:06:49.509> coming

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
there's a whole new generation coming

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.559 
there's a whole new generation coming
through<00:06:50.559> and<00:06:51.009> it's<00:06:51.279> two<00:06:51.489> finalists<00:06:52.029> a<00:06:52.179> style

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
through and it's two finalists a style

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.719 
through and it's two finalists a style
that<00:06:52.779> suits<00:06:52.959> their<00:06:53.289> generation<00:06:53.919> and<00:06:54.039> and<00:06:54.549> the

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:54.729 
that suits their generation and and the

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.600 
that suits their generation and and the

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
star we're going towards now is finding

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.549 
star we're going towards now is finding
that<00:06:57.789> nice<00:06:58.239> balance<00:06:58.509> between<00:06:58.749> attacking<00:06:59.319> the

00:06:59.549 --> 00:06:59.559 
that nice balance between attacking the

that nice balance between attacking the
fence<00:06:59.829> at<00:07:00.009> the<00:07:00.039> moment<00:07:00.399> probably<00:07:00.549> overly

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089 
fence at the moment probably overly

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.739 
fence at the moment probably overly
