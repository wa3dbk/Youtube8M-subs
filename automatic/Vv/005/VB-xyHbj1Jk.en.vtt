the frame that we're using on the tent
is<00:00:35.710> these<00:00:36.070> t6<00:00:36.730> alloy<00:00:37.120> poles<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:38.530> of

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
is these t6 alloy poles sort of

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.260 
is these t6 alloy poles sort of
lightweight<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.130> they're<00:00:39.280> very<00:00:39.399> strong<00:00:39.760> you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
lightweight and they're very strong you

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.850 
lightweight and they're very strong you
can<00:00:40.420> see<00:00:40.570> here<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:41.020> they<00:00:41.230> are<00:00:41.500> color-coded

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
can see here that they are color-coded

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.170 
can see here that they are color-coded
as<00:00:42.220> well<00:00:42.370> just<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.640> make<00:00:42.790> sure<00:00:42.940> you're<00:00:43.090> going

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
as well just to make sure you're going

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.700 
as well just to make sure you're going
to<00:00:43.239> get<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.480> right<00:00:43.630> one<00:00:43.810> through<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.559> right

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
to get the right one through the right

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.130 
to get the right one through the right
sleeve<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.550> if<00:00:45.850> positives<00:00:46.390> themselves<00:00:46.930> are

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
sleeve and if positives themselves are

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.930 
sleeve and if positives themselves are
flat<00:00:47.559> pool<00:00:47.800> sleeves<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.219> you<00:00:48.309> can<00:00:48.489> see<00:00:48.640> here

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
flat pool sleeves so you can see here

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.759 
flat pool sleeves so you can see here
that<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.510> tent<00:00:49.719> will<00:00:49.870> be<00:00:49.899> very<00:00:50.500> aerodynamic

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
that the tent will be very aerodynamic

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.500 
that the tent will be very aerodynamic
there's<00:00:51.370> nothing<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.910> sort<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.120> catch<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
there's nothing to sort of catch the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.419 
there's nothing to sort of catch the
wind<00:00:52.660> on<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.989> outside<00:00:53.379> and<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.949> increases

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
wind on the outside and that increases

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.889 
wind on the outside and that increases
the<00:00:54.460> overall<00:00:54.820> stability<00:00:54.969> of<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.539> tent<00:00:55.750> as

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
the overall stability of the tent as

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.450 
the overall stability of the tent as
well<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.590> gives<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:56.859> that<00:00:56.890> nice<00:00:57.160> smooth

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
well and gives it that nice smooth

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.970 
well and gives it that nice smooth
finish<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.929> guylines<00:00:59.289> also<00:00:59.649> have<00:00:59.800> their

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
finish all the guylines also have their

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.410 
finish all the guylines also have their
own<00:01:00.010> retainers<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:00.760> when<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.120> comes<00:01:01.300> to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
own retainers so when it comes to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.639 
own retainers so when it comes to
packing<00:01:01.600> down<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:01.960> tent<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.230> can<00:01:02.350> just<00:01:02.500> wrap

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
packing down the tent we can just wrap

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.959 
packing down the tent we can just wrap
these<00:01:02.769> up<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.190> pop<00:01:03.339> them<00:01:03.489> in<00:01:03.609> there<00:01:03.730> so

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
these up and pop them in there so

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.310 
these up and pop them in there so
they're<00:01:04.180> not<00:01:04.300> all<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.629> mess<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.989> next<00:01:05.199> time

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320
