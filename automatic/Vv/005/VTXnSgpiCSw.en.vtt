hello<00:00:04.950> I'm<00:00:05.100> JW<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.880> this<00:00:06.180> is<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.810> rather<00:00:07.050> old

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
hello I'm JW and this is a rather old

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.070 
hello I'm JW and this is a rather old
and<00:00:07.769> nasty<00:00:08.010> fuse<00:00:08.790> box<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.720> probably<00:00:09.990> for

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and nasty fuse box this is probably for

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.190 
and nasty fuse box this is probably for
the<00:00:10.170> 1970s<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.540> these<00:00:12.540> were<00:00:12.630> fitted<00:00:12.930> in<00:00:13.050> there

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the 1970s and these were fitted in there

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.500 
the 1970s and these were fitted in there
millions<00:00:13.440> literally<00:00:13.950> during<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> 70s<00:00:15.210> 80s

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:15.510 
millions literally during the 70s 80s

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.410 
millions literally during the 70s 80s
and<00:00:15.690> even<00:00:15.720> well<00:00:16.019> into<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.439> 1990s<00:00:17.300> this<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and even well into the 1990s this is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.940 
and even well into the 1990s this is
black<00:00:18.689> one<00:00:18.930> though<00:00:19.230> they<00:00:19.380> came<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.740> various

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
black one though they came in various

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.650 
black one though they came in various
other<00:00:20.039> colors<00:00:20.400> including<00:00:20.820> white<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.390> cream

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
other colors including white and cream

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
other colors including white and cream
and<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> load<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> gray<00:00:22.949> metal<00:00:23.760> ones

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and there was a load of gray metal ones

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.090 
and there was a load of gray metal ones
as<00:00:24.210> well<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:25.410> I've<00:00:25.470> still<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.010> these

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
as well now I've still got one of these

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.400 
as well now I've still got one of these
it's<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.400> necessarily<00:00:26.910> unsafe<00:00:27.360> but<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.289> he

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it's not necessarily unsafe but so he

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.080 
it's not necessarily unsafe but so he
could<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.770> some<00:00:28.949> upgrading<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.609> updating

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
could do with some upgrading or updating

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
could do with some upgrading or updating
and<00:00:30.270> in<00:00:30.359> most<00:00:30.510> cases<00:00:30.720> total<00:00:31.440> replacement<00:00:31.770> is

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
and in most cases total replacement is

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
and in most cases total replacement is
the<00:00:32.550> only<00:00:32.669> option<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> might<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.680> tempted

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the only option now you might be tempted

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
the only option now you might be tempted
to<00:00:35.100> upgrade<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:36.739> by<00:00:37.739> fitting<00:00:38.129> some<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.059> these

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
to upgrade it by fitting some of these

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.969 
to upgrade it by fitting some of these
in<00:00:39.449> it<00:00:39.569> now<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:40.140> plug-in<00:00:40.649> things

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
in it now these little plug-in things

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:43.419 
in it now these little plug-in things
just<00:00:41.850> replace<00:00:42.089> the<00:00:42.269> fuse<00:00:42.479> it<00:00:42.600> inside<00:00:43.079> but

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
just replace the fuse it inside but

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:45.379 
just replace the fuse it inside but
actually<00:00:44.429> buying<00:00:44.639> these<00:00:44.819> quickly<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:45.389 
actually buying these quickly is

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:46.700 
actually buying these quickly is
generally<00:00:45.749> a<00:00:45.780> complete<00:00:46.109> waste<00:00:46.229> of<00:00:46.409> money<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
generally a complete waste of money and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.959 
generally a complete waste of money and
time<00:00:46.999> but<00:00:47.999> some<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.359> why<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:48.929> is

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
time but some of it why that actually is

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.619 
time but some of it why that actually is
now<00:00:50.969> there's<00:00:51.179> nothing<00:00:51.389> particularly

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
now there's nothing particularly

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.610 
now there's nothing particularly
dangerous<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.649> unsafe<00:00:53.549> about<00:00:54.030> these<00:00:54.499> as<00:00:55.499> long

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
dangerous or unsafe about these as long

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.569 
dangerous or unsafe about these as long
as<00:00:55.709> you<00:00:55.769> remember<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.069> this<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.429> designed

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
as you remember that this was designed

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.689 
as you remember that this was designed

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
storage heaters now these pieces just

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.230 
storage heaters now these pieces just
plug<00:01:39.300> in<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.690> there<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.410> fuse<00:01:40.680> wire

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
plug in and there as the fuse wire

inside a very basic form of protection

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170 
inside a very basic form of protection
but<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.200> still<00:01:46.380> works<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.760> still<00:01:48.000> use

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
but it still works and you can still use

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.500 
but it still works and you can still use
them<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.540> there's<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.840> fuse<00:01:49.620> element<00:01:49.980> inside

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
them and there's the fuse element inside

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.060 
them and there's the fuse element inside
what<00:01:51.510> happens<00:01:51.870> there<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.080> if<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.530> circuit<00:01:53.010> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
what happens there is if the circuit is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.030 
what happens there is if the circuit is
overloaded<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.060> wire<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.450> heat<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
overloaded that wire will heat up and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.910 
overloaded that wire will heat up and
eventually<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.220> will<00:01:56.340> melt<00:01:57.290> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> short<00:01:58.740> out

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
eventually it will melt if you short out

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
eventually it will melt if you short out
the<00:01:59.070> circuit<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.729> what<00:01:59.909> you<00:01:59.970> get<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.150> many

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the circuit so what you get is many

amps<00:02:02.550> flows<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.690> essentially<00:02:04.020> destroys

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
amps flows and that essentially destroys

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.070 
amps flows and that essentially destroys
that<00:02:04.740> wire<00:02:04.950> pretty<00:02:05.280> much<00:02:05.400> instantly<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
that wire pretty much instantly and it

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.869 
that wire pretty much instantly and it
disappears<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.800> get<00:02:07.920> molten<00:02:08.640> copper

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
disappears and you get molten copper

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.240

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
spring out of the ends again you get

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.489 
spring out of the ends again you get

it<00:03:17.250> will<00:03:17.490> look<00:03:17.670> cause<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> thing<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.420> trip<00:03:18.930> off

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
it will look cause the thing to trip off

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.890 
it will look cause the thing to trip off
because<00:03:20.760> ice<00:03:20.910> exact<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> same<00:03:21.300> as<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> fuse

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900

because ice exact the same as the fuse
here<00:03:22.170> which<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:23.459> just<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.700> piece<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.970> wire<00:03:24.120> that

here which is just a piece of wire that
just<00:03:24.480> heats<00:03:24.630> up<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.050> obviously<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> current

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
just heats up and obviously the current

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.160 
just heats up and obviously the current

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
is too large heat up an elf and it will

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.380 
is too large heat up an elf and it will
melt<00:03:28.380> through<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.670> guard<00:03:29.940> exactly<00:03:30.330> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
same and for short circuits we're going

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.490 
same and for short circuits we're going
to<00:03:33.240> get<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> very<00:03:33.570> substantial<00:03:34.170> current

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500

inside and if managed field reaches a
certain<00:03:39.510> level<00:03:39.720> again<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.770> will<00:03:40.950> cause<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
certain level again that will cause the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.080 
certain level again that will cause the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
lever to trip off so the only real

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.790 
lever to trip off so the only real

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
benefit is that these can either be

there's no way of fitting the equipment
of<00:05:27.090> these<00:05:27.320> into<00:05:28.320> this<00:05:28.440> box<00:05:28.820> these<00:05:29.820> require<00:05:30.150> a

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
of these into this box these require a

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.450 
of these into this box these require a
two<00:05:31.229> pole<00:05:31.410> connection<00:05:31.710> this<00:05:32.010> is<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.370> a

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
two pole connection this is just a

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.480 
two pole connection this is just a
single<00:05:32.760> pole<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:34.139> again<00:05:34.800> it's<00:05:34.979> just<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:35.400> a

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
single pole so again it's just really a

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.969 
single pole so again it's just really a
complete<00:05:35.850> waste<00:05:36.060> of<00:05:36.240> time<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:37.530> other<00:05:37.650> style

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
complete waste of time the other style

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.920 
complete waste of time the other style
of<00:05:38.070> these<00:05:38.220> ones<00:05:38.520> which<00:05:38.789> are<00:05:39.300> basically<00:05:39.600> one<00:05:39.810> of

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
of these ones which are basically one of

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.230 
of these ones which are basically one of
these<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.530> one<00:05:41.190> of<00:05:41.220> these<00:05:41.340> combined<00:05:41.910> into<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
these and one of these combined into the

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.200 
these and one of these combined into the
same<00:05:42.450> unit<00:05:43.460> generally<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.490> better<00:05:44.610> idea<00:05:44.820> that

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
same unit generally a better idea that

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.820 
same unit generally a better idea that
again<00:05:45.570> there's<00:05:45.750> no<00:05:45.840> way<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.080> fitting<00:05:46.229> the

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
again there's no way of fitting the

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.210 
again there's no way of fitting the
equipment<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:47.370> into<00:05:48.120> there<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:49.220> simply

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
equipment of this into there so simply

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.690 
equipment of this into there so simply
not<00:05:50.370> possible<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:50.940> do<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:53.370> other<00:05:53.400> problem

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
not possible to do it the other problem

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.980 
not possible to do it the other problem
with<00:05:53.760> these<00:05:53.849> ones<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.270> they<00:05:54.389> have<00:05:54.539> this<00:05:54.660> wooden

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
with these ones is they have this wooden

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.839 
with these ones is they have this wooden
backing<00:05:55.440> which<00:05:55.620> though<00:05:56.099> is<00:05:56.250> allowed<00:05:56.550> at<00:05:56.760> the

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
backing which though is allowed at the

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.820 
backing which though is allowed at the
moment<00:05:57.180> that's<00:05:57.570> there<00:05:57.870> when<00:05:58.530> it's<00:05:58.680> being

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
moment that's there when it's being

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.180 
moment that's there when it's being

don't<00:06:17.400> bother<00:06:17.550> the<00:06:18.150> waste<00:06:18.330> of<00:06:18.479> time<00:06:18.690> and<00:06:18.900> money

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
don't bother the waste of time and money

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.219 
don't bother the waste of time and money
these<00:06:20.849> circuit<00:06:21.180> breakers<00:06:21.510> only<00:06:21.810> do<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.050> same

these circuit breakers only do the same

these circuit breakers only do the same

easily<00:06:27.240> whereas<00:06:27.810> what's<00:06:28.020> these<00:06:28.169> old<00:06:28.349> fuses

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
easily whereas what's these old fuses

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.290 
easily whereas what's these old fuses
it's<00:06:28.950> bit<00:06:29.070> of<00:06:29.160> a<00:06:29.220> bother<00:06:29.370> to<00:06:29.639> get<00:06:29.789> the<00:06:29.880> old<00:06:30.030> fuse

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
it's bit of a bother to get the old fuse

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.050 
it's bit of a bother to get the old fuse
wire<00:06:30.479> out<00:06:30.660> and<00:06:30.740> rethread<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:31.830> in<00:06:31.919> there<00:06:32.130> but<00:06:33.000> of

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
wire out and rethread it in there but of

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
wire out and rethread it in there but of
course<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.300> fuses<00:06:33.599> are<00:06:33.630> blowing<00:06:33.960> all<00:06:34.050> the

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
course the fuses are blowing all the

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.510 
course the fuses are blowing all the
time<00:06:34.380> then<00:06:34.770> clearly<00:06:35.130> there's<00:06:35.340> a<00:06:35.370> major

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
time then clearly there's a major

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.700 
time then clearly there's a major
problem<00:06:35.789> with<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.090> installation<00:06:36.780> doesn't

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
problem with the installation doesn't

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.380 
problem with the installation doesn't
matter<00:06:37.830> what<00:06:37.979> you've<00:06:38.070> replaced<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.490> with<00:06:38.520> the

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
matter what you've replaced it with the

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.670 
matter what you've replaced it with the
problem<00:06:39.659> is<00:06:39.719> still<00:06:39.840> going<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.050> be<00:06:40.140> there<00:06:40.320> it's

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
problem is still going to be there it's

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.719 
problem is still going to be there it's
not<00:06:40.710> going<00:06:40.890> to<00:06:40.979> go<00:06:41.070> away<00:06:41.159> and<00:06:41.430> it's<00:06:41.580> probably

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:41.729 
not going to go away and it's probably

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:42.470 
not going to go away and it's probably
an<00:06:41.880> again<00:06:42.060> much

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
an again much

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480 
an again much
worse<00:06:42.630> so<00:06:43.500> best<00:06:43.710> say<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:43.950> money<00:06:44.100> and<00:06:44.310> put<00:06:44.370> it

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
worse so best say the money and put it

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.790 
worse so best say the money and put it
was<00:06:44.670> new<00:06:44.880> consumer<00:06:45.360> in<00:06:45.480> it<00:06:45.630> which<00:06:46.500> will<00:06:46.650> have

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
there it's a quality installation would

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.450 
there it's a quality installation would
