00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.150
 good friends and first of all I have him 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.280
 to apologize to all my friends 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.500
 because try to upload this video on the 12th 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.880
 July but unfortunately can not 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.920
 because I was finding out if the 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.990
 challenge that he sent could have 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.000
 good results when sending to videos 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.240
 that to upload them tells you that 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.340
 blocked around the world and today I'm going 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.320
 to solve how to erase 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.330
 copyright claims that in 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.640
 reality is very annoying for those 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.970
 people that nonprofits raise 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.400
 your videos and they want you to post them 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 nothing more 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.800
 not for profit or without profit 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.660
 this has to be without good profits 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.550
 that content always appears because 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 when you know it with a background song 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.130
 of an artist or a video or a photo you 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.460
 This claim will appear 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.960
 because the laws claim it and good 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.110
 here I bring you everything is the video 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.770
 and look at the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.160
 is to go to our link and then go to 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.810
 video manager and then we go to the video 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.210
 who has this claim of rights 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.880
 reserved and we click on it has 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.590
 found content matches of 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.860
 third parties 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.220
 after that we will leave this page 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.960
 and here on this page you get to see the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.910
 claim is telling you that your 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.270
 video has been blocked in certain 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.220
 countries you always say and here also in 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.350
 bold tells you that this claim does not 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.390
 affects your account but when you have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.850
 several videos with this kind of 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.640
 claims your account if you put in 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.610
 danger but this claim is 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 objection that we are going to send no no 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.800
 see another occasion to that to the contrary 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 this good puts you all 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.270
 all your account in good condition 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.840
 well after that we give in I think 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.150
 that this copyright claim is not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 valid and then we select the option 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.590
 of the use you make of the content 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.660
 meets the legal requirements goddess 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.570
 legitimate treatment according to 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.790
 the applicable copyright laws 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.060
 there we select and then we give in 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.510
 continue we give you continue and the farc 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 this page appears 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.659
 it appears in this box and warns you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.030
 that if you are sure to send the 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.659
 objection and obviously you have to 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.370
 check it and you give in continue and here 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.769
 you get the claims that you're going to 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.329
 send on this page that you have ipade 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.900
 if you see several only the checks 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.450
 all 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.849
 and then this text that is here 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.960
 we give and select everything and 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.420
 we copy 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.830
 and then you stick it in this space in 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.680
 White 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.380
 do not stick and ready then check in the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 part of the water below tells you that 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.880
 put your full name and use a 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.190
 electronic signature that you write the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.640
 user that you have on youtube is the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.830
 user 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.800
 just in case that's the username 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.260
 Write if you give in to continue you 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.990
 this will appear and it will tell you to verify 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 the information that you are going to send good 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.580
 we see everything is in order and we give 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.770
 send a challenge will ask us what 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.380
 there is a safe to accept or cancel 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.420
 we accept and that's all 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.080
 and now our inclination has been 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.660
 sent successfully 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.050
 good and then you're going to go back to the manager 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 videos and well suddenly you see it in the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.130
 claim there but not in time 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.160
 recent cases when you send the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.010
 objection 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.780
 the claim is deleted instantly but 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.550
 in the other 30% of the claims 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.700
 they're still there but they're waiting for a 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:46.270
 answer the other 30% of cases that 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.970
 you send just spend a month and wait 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.560
 the claim is deleted and the last 30% 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.230
 is that they respond with a blockage of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.170
 countries but spending a time is erased 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.840
 the blockade but maybe the best is 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.430
 that keep you in good account 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.470
 been and do not put it in bad shape is 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.620
 well that objection if you want 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.600
 become a YouTube partner you do not go 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.330
 to power because this challenge only 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.240
 It serves for 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.720
 to ignore claims without purpose 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.959
 of profit if you want to be the partner well 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.590
 have income with your videos 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.250
 more videos have to be with 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.630
 they do not have to be artists or third parties 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.970
 this kind of information I already explained to you 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.580
 in the next tutorial good I tell you 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.050
 well, I hope you support me 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.000
 this is my first tutorial that I do 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.169
 sorry for the wait but now if I go 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.310
 to be more punctual because I'm 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.280
 finding out really truly in earnest and 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.360
 thank you very much comment 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.360
 see you later
