because<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:35.250> purely<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.000> there's

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
because just purely just because there's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.609 
because just purely just because there's
a<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.270> crack<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> runs<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> side

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
a little crack that runs down the side

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
a little crack that runs down the side
there<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.430> completely

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
there so don't think it's completely

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.730 
there so don't think it's completely
waterproof<00:01:39.170> obviously<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> front<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
waterproof obviously on the front on the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.260 
waterproof obviously on the front on the
main<00:01:40.979> zip<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> does<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
main zip you will see that it does have

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
main zip you will see that it does have
an<00:01:42.390> exposed<00:01:42.810> zip<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.799> open<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
an exposed zip but if we open it up the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.340 
an exposed zip but if we open it up the
actual<00:01:45.090> storm<00:01:45.360> flap<00:01:45.570> itself<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.049> actually

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
actual storm flap itself is actually

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
actual storm flap itself is actually
tucked<00:01:46.770> away<00:01:47.009> behind<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.240> still

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
tucked away behind it so it's still

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
tucked away behind it so it's still
going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.630> give<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> keep<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> waterproof

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
going to give you keep you waterproof

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.590 
going to give you keep you waterproof
and<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.189> also<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> help<00:01:50.880> with<00:01:51.149> wind

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and it's also going to help with wind

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210 
and it's also going to help with wind
reduction<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.829> won't<00:01:52.950> interfere

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
reduction as well so it won't interfere

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
reduction as well so it won't interfere
with<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.729> core<00:01:54.030> body<00:01:54.270> temperature<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
with your core body temperature on the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
with your core body temperature on the
inside<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> pretty<00:01:56.909> standard<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.689> they

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
inside it's a pretty standard if they

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.060 
inside it's a pretty standard if they
obviously<00:01:57.930> they<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> keep<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.649> jacket

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
obviously they want to keep this jacket

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
obviously they want to keep this jacket
lightweight<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> obviously<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
lightweight and obviously you want it to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
lightweight and obviously you want it to
work<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.619> moving<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.189> stretch<00:02:02.460> technology

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
work with moving the stretch technology

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.399 
work with moving the stretch technology
so<00:02:03.270> there's<00:02:03.420> no<00:02:03.540> pockets<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:03.990> anything<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
so there's no pockets or anything on the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749 
so there's no pockets or anything on the
inside<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> only<00:02:05.520> thing<00:02:05.640> you've

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
inside there at the only thing you've

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.010 
inside there at the only thing you've
got<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:05.969> kind<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.390> hood<00:02:06.570> adjusters

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
got this kind of your hood adjusters

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
got this kind of your hood adjusters
which<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.619> tucked<00:02:07.829> away<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.399> there<00:02:08.700> nicely

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
which are tucked away in there nicely

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729 
which are tucked away in there nicely
and<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.050> say<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.319> don't<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> take

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and as I say if you don't want to take

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.380 
and as I say if you don't want to take
them<00:02:10.860> off<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.129> as<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.430> take<00:02:11.730> them<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.180> as

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
them off you can as you take them out as

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.470 
them off you can as you take them out as
well<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> know

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
well you know

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.119 
well you know
you<00:02:13.959> know<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.170> they<00:02:14.290> look<00:02:14.409> like<00:02:14.530> them<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.099> know

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
you know if they look like them you know

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.280 
you know if they look like them you know
touching<00:02:15.459> your<00:02:15.790> inside<00:02:16.150> should<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.480> say<00:02:16.659> you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
touching your inside should we say you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.680 
touching your inside should we say you
know<00:02:17.409> your<00:02:17.590> inner<00:02:18.010> parts<00:02:18.400> but<00:02:18.610> zip<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.510> up

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
know your inner parts but zip this up

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.949 
know your inner parts but zip this up
and<00:02:19.840> let's<00:02:19.989> take<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.260> closer<00:02:20.709> look<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> back

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
and let's take a closer look at the back

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.330 
and let's take a closer look at the back
so<00:02:22.959> what<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.260> will<00:02:23.440> notice<00:02:23.650> even<00:02:24.099> though<00:02:24.280> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
so what you will notice even though it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.039 
so what you will notice even though it
does<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> stretched<00:02:25.030> technology<00:02:25.840> in<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
does have a stretched technology in the

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.479 
does have a stretched technology in the
way<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.349> it's<00:02:26.500> designed<00:02:26.650> us<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.069> be<00:02:27.190> closer

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
way that it's designed us to be closer

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.890 
way that it's designed us to be closer
and<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.849> obviously<00:02:28.120> move<00:02:28.269> through<00:02:28.420> view<00:02:28.569> it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and to obviously move through view it

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.780 
and to obviously move through view it
still<00:02:29.200> does<00:02:29.379> have<00:02:29.530> an<00:02:29.650> Alpine<00:02:30.099> fit<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
still does have an Alpine fit to it to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.610 
still does have an Alpine fit to it to
give<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> closer<00:02:31.450> fit<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:31.930> well<00:02:32.170> so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
give you a closer fit as well so

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.410 
give you a closer fit as well so
slightly<00:02:33.099> inwards<00:02:33.549> on<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> sides<00:02:34.000> there<00:02:34.239> and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
slightly inwards on the sides there and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.000 
slightly inwards on the sides there and
it<00:02:34.690> does<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> slight<00:02:35.410> droop<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it does have a slight droop in the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.710 
it does have a slight droop in the
bottom<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.580> as<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.700> said<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.360> design

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
bottom there and as I said this design

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.119 
bottom there and as I said this design
with<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> stretch<00:02:38.260> technology<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:38.980> going

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
with the stretch technology it's going

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.920 
with the stretch technology it's going
to<00:02:39.190> give<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> really<00:02:40.060> nice<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.599> really

comfortable<00:02:41.349> fit<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.400> way<00:02:42.430> through<00:02:42.819> so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
comfortable fit all the way through so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.610 
comfortable fit all the way through so
even<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.480> say<00:02:43.599> you<00:02:43.959> doing<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> bit<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.379> thumb
