now<00:04:55.390> as<00:04:55.920> you<00:04:56.920> see<00:04:57.130> there's<00:04:57.400> so<00:04:58.240> many<00:04:58.620> points<00:04:59.620> in

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
now as you see there's so many points in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.010 
now as you see there's so many points in
this<00:05:00.750> movement<00:05:02.670> that<00:05:03.670> that<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.630> can<00:05:04.810> do

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
this movement that that you can do

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.000 
this movement that that you can do
robotic<00:05:05.800> Lee<00:05:05.980> and<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:07.410> varies<00:05:08.410> between<00:05:08.530> it

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
robotic Lee and it varies between it

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.730 
robotic Lee and it varies between it
being<00:05:09.040> a<00:05:09.840> hard<00:05:10.840> stop<00:05:11.350> or<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:12.720> small<00:05:13.720> stop<00:05:14.080> that

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
being a hard stop or a small stop that

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.380 
being a hard stop or a small stop that
builds<00:05:15.040> up<00:05:15.160> to<00:05:15.400> another<00:05:15.640> stop<00:05:15.940> like<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.270> could

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
builds up to another stop like it could

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.260 
builds up to another stop like it could
be<00:05:16.420> almost<00:05:17.260> little<00:05:17.920> mini<00:05:18.220> combos<00:05:18.790> in<00:05:19.030> these

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
be almost little mini combos in these

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.110 
be almost little mini combos in these
movements<00:05:20.550> because<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.670> doesn't<00:05:21.880> have<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:22.060> be

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
movements because it doesn't have to be

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.080 
movements because it doesn't have to be
this<00:05:22.330> slow<00:05:22.600> as<00:05:22.780> just<00:05:23.140> for<00:05:24.090> instructional

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
this slow as just for instructional

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.120 
this slow as just for instructional
purposes<00:05:25.170> it<00:05:26.170> could<00:05:26.320> be<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.440> little<00:05:26.620> faster

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
purposes it could be a little faster

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:34.510 
purposes it could be a little faster
show<00:05:28.060> them<00:05:28.240> a<00:05:28.390> little<00:05:28.570> faster

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.350 

see<00:05:35.520> or<00:05:35.940> can<00:05:36.600> be<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:37.020> little<00:05:37.230> slower<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:38.360> broken

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
see or can be a little slower and broken

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.379 
see or can be a little slower and broken
down<00:05:39.600> a<00:05:40.340> little<00:05:41.340> more<00:05:41.580> machine<00:05:42.150> like<00:05:44.030> yes<00:05:45.030> I

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
down a little more machine like yes I

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.230 
down a little more machine like yes I
