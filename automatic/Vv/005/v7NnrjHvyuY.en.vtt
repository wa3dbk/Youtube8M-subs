hour and a half to complete let me
explain<00:01:18.560> before<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> start<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.460> need

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
explain before you start you will need

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
explain before you start you will need
to<00:01:20.670> check<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.330> issue<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.960> dirty<00:01:22.439> veins

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to check that the issue is dirty veins

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
to check that the issue is dirty veins
are<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.400> mechanical<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> please<00:01:25.259> see

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
are not mechanical to do this please see

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.840 
are not mechanical to do this please see
our<00:01:25.500> website<00:01:27.380> firstly<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.799> exhaust<00:01:29.220> manifold

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
our website firstly the exhaust manifold

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.210 
our website firstly the exhaust manifold
needs<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.600> unbolted<00:01:30.990> from<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> turbo<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
needs to be unbolted from the turbo and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.450 
needs to be unbolted from the turbo and
the<00:01:32.369> cards<00:01:32.790> need<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.329> bolted<00:01:33.720> back<00:01:33.869> on

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
the cards need to be bolted back on

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
the cards need to be bolted back on
secondly<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.759> use<00:01:36.000> turbo<00:01:36.509> clean<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.530> high

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
secondly we use turbo clean one a high

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
secondly we use turbo clean one a high
quality<00:01:38.180> carbon<00:01:39.180> busting<00:01:39.689> chemical<00:01:40.259> which<00:01:40.470> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
quality carbon busting chemical which is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.370 
quality carbon busting chemical which is
sprayed<00:01:40.979> directly<00:01:41.189> into<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> turbo<00:01:42.689> through

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sprayed directly into the turbo through

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.530 
sprayed directly into the turbo through
the<00:01:43.530> exhaustion<00:01:44.159> met<00:01:44.430> using<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> special

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the exhaustion met using the special

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560 
the exhaustion met using the special
application<00:01:46.439> nozzle<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.030> left<00:01:48.329> for

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
application nozzle this is then left for

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080 
application nozzle this is then left for
one<00:01:48.899> hour<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.740> break<00:01:49.950> down<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.820> hard

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
one hour to break down all of that hard

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.020 
one hour to break down all of that hard
and<00:01:51.420> difficult<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:52.049> remove<00:01:52.350> carbon<00:01:53.030> thirdly

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and difficult to remove carbon thirdly

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.319 
and difficult to remove carbon thirdly
after<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> hours<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.250> spray<00:01:56.610> turbo<00:01:57.060> clean

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
after the hours up we spray turbo clean

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.260 
after the hours up we spray turbo clean
too<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.170> turbo<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.460> will<00:01:59.670> flush<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
too into the turbo this will flush the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
too into the turbo this will flush the
turbos<00:02:00.689> through<00:02:00.960> removing<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.680> traces<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
turbos through removing all traces of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
turbos through removing all traces of
carbon<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.939> turbo<00:02:03.360> clue<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:04.070> freeing<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.219> all

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
carbon and turbo clue one freeing up all

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.130 
carbon and turbo clue one freeing up all
those<00:02:05.759> important<00:02:06.540> veins
