00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.270
 can score 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.850
 today we are at the last part of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.260
 classic resident evil trilogy 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.900
 namely , it is from the years with them 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 1999 the third part is scheduled 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 few hours before and after the second 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.110
 So part is practically a prequel and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.400
 10 in contrast to part 1 and 2 have 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.810
 This time we do not choose between two 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.520
 different characters but 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.680
 play only as a jill valentine out part 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.329
 1 jill valentine was after the incident 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.650
 suspended in the mansion of stars and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.390
 We have to get out of the zombie with her now 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.890
 at current rather than the game escape 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.810
 first starts with one for then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 conditions absolutely spectacular 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.560
 render sequences seen the raccoon city 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.910
 I'm completely overrun by zombies 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.260
 Every now and then I only play the game 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 made around again this intro 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.040
 Sequence to watch absolutely world class 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.270
 I always look at it nowadays 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.380
 still like to and I have the intro 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 just a best possible quality 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.190
 uploaded separately link in the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 description I think that should everyone 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 I have seen them all now 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 three parts directly after each other 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.090
 gambled at the third part 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.710
 especially the modernized control 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.299
 and the good feeling on many 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 then have around with the control 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.540
 bitched and that 's why they have the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.520
 third improves and gives 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 It now turns 180 degrees 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 somehow it gets faster and faster 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.510
 In addition, we do not have to be more accurate 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 as always in the old parts 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.230
 press action keys but stairs 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.730
 can just run that high, too 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.770
 we can attack opponents now 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.630
 just push away or dodge in the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.310
 Contrary to the previous parts are 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.659
 We at one it is extremely often outside 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.100
 on the go and the customer raccoon city 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 Every now and then we land, of course 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.610
 We are also in buildings, for example 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.120
 Here again short police headquarters 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.890
 Part 2 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.310
 but we come to the name of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.510
 resident evil 3 and 2 ms we meet 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.610
 the first time before the police headquarters 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.770
 where he brad vickers the helicopter pilot 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 from part 1 there is a plate power afterwards 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 another new element in the series 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 namely we can decide 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.799
 There are several points in the game 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.220
 we can decide what we are 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.930
 do 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 mostly this decision is as well 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.220
 In that case, I curse or fight for 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.180
 my part piss me off every time of 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.369
 mss if I can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750
 from then on, the hunt begins and it comes 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.429
 over and over again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.019
 kill them and we can do them so often 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.909
 flattening as we want it comes 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.260
 over and over again as a smaller one 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.790
 pisser I'm always so so 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.170
 Actually , penis buying is that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.849
 it was not solemn anymore 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 All penis head is very appropriate 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.490
 But my head was a bit like 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.540
 an acorn or toyota 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.030
 a few sexually transmitted diseases and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.030
 acorn parmesan decorated stylish 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.610
 we hear a noise and dynamic 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.500
 music if that is like the whole 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.150
 acoustic background in all resident 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.640
 evil part absolutely world class 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.490
 the song means a lot of detention and it 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.470
 really nice and unpleasant 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.730
 then comes fair and immediately a mÃ¼nch 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.650
 is almost or even missed so 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.970
 Quickly it goes and he jumps one with 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 top-speed afterwards 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.060
 I thought it was more groundbreaking at the time 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.170
 to do cat-and-mouse-play and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.030
 It is spread simply within 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.510
 of milliseconds absolute panic at 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.160
 player 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.080
 you just want world that you can 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.520
 really scary well implemented what 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 I have always been with resident evil 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.700
 that's absurd , it does not matter how 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.260
 the situation is hot and how close 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 we are dead when we are last 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.160
 can save seconds from space 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.110
 we still go with the rest and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.730
 serenity of a buddhist monk 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.890
 so that yourself and the world in 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.739
 complete harmony is through the door 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 Just do not rush except for 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.920
 the innovations are resident evil 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.720
 3 as well as its predecessors and exactly 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.459
 that makes it a perfect one for me 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.170
 continued that's what the problem 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.910
 Many game developers have to check them 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.290
 just not that the pens of a series 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.880
 in principle always a similar game 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.530
 which the want to have what they previously 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.180
 have now celebrated with a new one 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.900
 Scenario and playful banker 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.489
 developments 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.049
 They do not want a completely different game 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.670
 where everything is shot at what 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.320
 the predecessor has been identified 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.640
 resident evil also simply classic 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.530
 develop further and a second 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.750
 the game series can do the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.459
 then we call the zombie or as a 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.260
 shit and there is then bawled around 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.049
 everyone would be happy and satisfied 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.370
 been but no revel is a big one 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.380
 name and the cow finally has to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.690
 be milked until it is no longer possible 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.670
 so that was the resident evil trilogy 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.079
 for the playstation 1 here again the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.239
 other two parts if you the 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.440
 missed after the three best part 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.570
 I'm doing a little now 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.070
 That's why there is the resident evil break 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.400
 next few days a few others 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.400
 games
