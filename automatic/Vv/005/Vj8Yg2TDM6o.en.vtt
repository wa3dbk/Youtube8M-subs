00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.330 
wall breakers and only jumps which is
something<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:28.180> don't<00:02:28.629> like<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.379> really<00:02:29.530> don't

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
something I don't like I really don't

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.599 
something I don't like I really don't
think<00:02:30.430> that's<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.879> good<00:02:30.909> idea<00:02:32.250> cuz<00:02:33.250> it's<00:02:33.400> pretty

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
think that's a good idea cuz it's pretty

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.039 
think that's a good idea cuz it's pretty
easy<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.909> make<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> base<00:02:34.359> that<00:02:34.659> would<00:02:34.750> screw<00:02:35.019> up

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
easy to make a base that would screw up

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.470 
easy to make a base that would screw up
someone<00:02:35.889> who<00:02:35.980> only<00:02:36.159> uses<00:02:36.430> jumps<00:02:36.819> but<00:02:37.299> he's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
someone who only uses jumps but he's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.659 
someone who only uses jumps but he's
already<00:02:37.780> taken<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.769> first<00:02:39.099> start<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:39.489> me

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
already taken that first start for me

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.550 
already taken that first start for me
and<00:02:39.790> that's<00:02:39.849> 13<00:02:40.480> trophies<00:02:40.930> gone<00:02:41.139> from<00:02:41.409> me

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and that's 13 trophies gone from me

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.190 
and that's 13 trophies gone from me
already<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:45.120> now<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.659> a<00:02:46.810> matter<00:02:46.840> of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
already and now it's just a matter of

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.059 
already and now it's just a matter of
him<00:02:47.409> picking<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:48.099> last<00:02:48.310> ten<00:02:48.700> percent<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.709 
him picking up the last ten percent and
he's<00:02:51.069> gonna<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.730> able<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:52.239> do<00:02:52.419> that<00:02:53.189> and<00:02:54.719> really

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
he's gonna be able to do that and really

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.929 
he's gonna be able to do that and really

let's see I'll probably want to split up
my<00:05:01.030> hero<00:05:01.300> so<00:05:01.600> they<00:05:01.720> each<00:05:01.900> take<00:05:02.169> out<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.530> storage

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570
