00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.200
 the German premium manufacturers 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 keep a close eye on each other 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.489
 the g is only compared to that 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.739
 until the bmw x6 is a good example of this 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.630
 but the other way around this also happens are you 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.520
 looks very closely at Mercedes 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.800
 have been building a 2 series since last year 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.170
 active tourer because then another answer 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.440
 the Mercedes B-Class should orphans 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.850
 has been more than successful for years 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.400
 but that's not the point today 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 one view today to the bmw x6 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.860
 the new yes we are going to drive fast with that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.420
 gle coupé if it is on the market 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.009
 but now we go for the new xs 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.890
 feel and we do that 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.180
 with a m performance model the bmw x6 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.950
 m50d 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.600
 that's a 3 liter six-in-line 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.590
 diesel engine with 381 hp and 740 new 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300
 measure and couple 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.149
 resulting in a sprint of 0 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.060
 to 100 within 5.2 seconds 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.140
 a limited top speed of 250 km per 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.729
 o'clock 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.980
 but we must already know these truths 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.000
 earlier in the new x5 m50d 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.310
 only in this xs new x6 m50d will that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.480
 dynamic and sportier 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.670
 being 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.400
 we are going to find out what we think today 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.340
 from the new minus 6 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.680
 but especially whether this new xs is ready 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:56.210
 for the battle with the Mercedes-Benz gl 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.280
 is a coupé compared to bmw x5 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.380
 this I six even sportier 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.030
 that is because of the sloping roof line 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 that is the center of gravity of the car 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 much lower 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.700
 we have less oliebol and we can 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.040
 So do get some higher cornering 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.020
 the m50d also comes standard with 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.970
 an active and chassis 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.950
 that makes that car warm very very tight 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 sometimes you might dive into my cut that i do 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.410
 six him so pretty to the only downside of it 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.850
 that chassis is that we do here and there 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.100
 lack some comfort 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.710
 car is fairly stiff and I have not 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 certain setting for that chassis 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.460
 I can call the car at one 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.840
 set comfort mode because that has then 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.460
 it actually covers the again 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.700
 gearbox and steering 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.700
 car 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.840
 m50 no blog remains special 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330
 piece of technology and 3 liter diesel engine 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.090
 with three turbos 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.590
 an insane gas response 740 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.780
 newton meter torque 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.900
 really insane if you gas it 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.520
 goes super fast in a line 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.470
 the first turbo works on until 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.530
 fifteen hundred revs 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.090
 second door but up to 27 under revs 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.360
 and that last project that takes care of it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.720
 ultimately for that pack of assets 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.760
 381 hp 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.650
 special figures diesel engine 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.659
 only pity is we miss a piece 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.340
 emotion we have his generator on 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.090
 board that so hard and well for fun 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.260
 sound 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.000
 stand a sport 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.950
 but in the end it doesn't matter 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
 goosebumps moments and maybe that will come 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.060
 a bit by BMW themselves how 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.630
 have set the bar very high at m 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.390
 to address the performance label 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.890
 Furthermore, the controls are also very light 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.630
 they can be a bit heavier again 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.730
 should be put through motorsports 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 put only becomes the gearbox 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.540
 then again a little nervous that are 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.030
 cannot be set separately 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.280
 sloping roofline actually does it too 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 something with the design might make one 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.620
 special car 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.290
 the first generation bmw i 16 2006 on the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.140
 market came that was a very brutal car 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.300
 it had a very aggressive appearance and 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.400
 this second generation I six 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.110
 both become a lot friendlier 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.730
 more like everyone's friend 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.440
 it is because that roof line is completely 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.150
 continues to the rear 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.180
 the previous generation x and was a whole 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.740
 high back and this all runs 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.690
 tighter 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.660
 also the rear lights and the headlights 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.770
 are slightly thinner and therefore tighter and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.250
 the theme also back in it 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.570
 interior 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.370
 it's one 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.310
 very tight car it feels like 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.760
 coming home like in every BMW 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.580
 looks insanely licked out wheel 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.950
 and distortion sends you very thinly tasty 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.990
 but ultimately it does 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.780
 again before the idiote sends the light and 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.430
 not really sporty feel it 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.490
 sometimes feels a bit too easy 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.490
 to 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.520
 the x6 m50d can be ordered from 118,000 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.720
 euros 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.940
 but that is of course not the only one 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.960
 diesel variant i can be ordered because 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.310
 from 86,000 euros you have an xf 30d with 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.360
 just not 300 hp 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.800
 there is also a 40d with 313 hp and there 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.590
 are of course multiple gasoline 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.150
 variants of which the xsm and where it 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.550
 is top model 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.140
 short and well covered in 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.480
 nice jacket 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.270
 the xs is ready for the battle with the 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.660
 mercedes-benz gl e so i say leave that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.660
 but come
