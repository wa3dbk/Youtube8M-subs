hey<00:00:00.450> guys<00:00:00.630> in<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.110> we're<00:00:01.380> gonna<00:00:01.439> be

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hey guys in this video we're gonna be

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.130 
hey guys in this video we're gonna be
putting<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.949> HTC<00:00:02.669> One<00:00:03.000> in<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.360> iPhone<00:00:03.810> 5

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
putting the HTC One in the iPhone 5

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.380 
putting the HTC One in the iPhone 5
against<00:00:04.650> each<00:00:04.770> other<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.220> some<00:00:05.790> speed<00:00:06.089> test

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
against each other in some speed test

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.629 
against each other in some speed test
and<00:00:06.690> benchmarking<00:00:07.379> performance<00:00:08.010> tests<00:00:08.309> so

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
and benchmarking performance tests so

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.580 
and benchmarking performance tests so
let's<00:00:08.849> start<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.210> off<00:00:09.480> by<00:00:09.719> clearing<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
let's start this off by clearing the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259 
let's start this off by clearing the
applications<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:12.000> both

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
applications that we have on both

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.690 
applications that we have on both
devices<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.620> first<00:00:13.830> application<00:00:14.549> we're

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
devices and the first application we're

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.970 
devices and the first application we're
gonna<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:15.000> benchmarking<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> Geekbench

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
gonna be benchmarking here is Geekbench

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.740 
gonna be benchmarking here is Geekbench
2<00:00:17.279> now<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.490> can<00:00:17.760> see<00:00:17.910> all<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> specs<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
2 now you can see all of the specs of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.140 
2 now you can see all of the specs of
both<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.740> phones<00:00:20.100> right<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.880> front

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
both of these phones right here in front

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
both of these phones right here in front
of<00:00:21.240> us<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.480> let's<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.990> ahead<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.199> run<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of us so let's go ahead and run the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400 
of us so let's go ahead and run the
benchmarks<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:24.119> which<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.750> comes<00:00:25.080> out<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
benchmarks to see which one comes out on

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.820 
benchmarks to see which one comes out on

now<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.220> HTC<00:00:27.029> one<00:00:27.269> easily<00:00:27.779> beats<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
now the HTC one easily beats out the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.320 
now the HTC one easily beats out the
iPhone<00:00:28.380> 5<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.730> newer<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.210> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
iPhone 5 it is a lot newer and it is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.080 
iPhone 5 it is a lot newer and it is
using<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> quad<00:00:31.140> core<00:00:31.410> processor<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:32.520> iPhone<00:00:32.820> 5

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
using a quad core processor the iPhone 5

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
using a quad core processor the iPhone 5
is<00:00:33.329> using<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> dual<00:00:33.989> core<00:00:34.170> processor<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
is using a dual core processor and you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.310 
is using a dual core processor and you
can<00:00:35.370> even<00:00:35.550> tell<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> Geekbench<00:00:36.690> score

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
can even tell that the Geekbench score

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
can even tell that the Geekbench score
is<00:00:37.530> higher<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> Nexus<00:00:39.000> 10<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.809> HTC

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
is higher than the Nexus 10 on the HTC

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
is higher than the Nexus 10 on the HTC
one<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.040> next<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.399> we're<00:00:41.550> gonna<00:00:41.640> do

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one now the next thing we're gonna do

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.299 
one now the next thing we're gonna do
here<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.149> test<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> Wi-Fi<00:00:43.680> speeds<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
here is test out the Wi-Fi speeds and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
here is test out the Wi-Fi speeds and
the<00:00:44.760> Wi-Fi<00:00:45.149> performance<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.989> both<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.410> these

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the Wi-Fi performance of both of these

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
the Wi-Fi performance of both of these
so<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:46.920> hit<00:00:47.190> begin<00:00:47.579> test<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so we're gonna hit begin test here and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.229 
so we're gonna hit begin test here and
we<00:00:49.020> are<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.469> same<00:00:49.800> server<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.430> each<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
we are on the same server on each of the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
we are on the same server on each of the
devices<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.199> had<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.739> mixed

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
devices and I had some really mixed

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.819 
devices and I had some really mixed
results<00:00:53.460> with<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> developer

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
results with this I think the developer

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
results with this I think the developer
of<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.039> application<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of this application said that this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
of this application said that this
application<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.989> actually<00:00:58.230> screwed<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.219> if

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
application is actually screwed up if

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
application is actually screwed up if
you<00:00:59.520> look<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> app<00:01:00.059> store<00:01:00.359> notes<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you look in the app store notes so that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.369 
you look in the app store notes so that
may<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.520> reason<00:01:02.789> why<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.870> funky

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
may be a reason why this is so funky

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
may be a reason why this is so funky
right<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.580> did<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> test<00:01:06.090> again

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
right now and I did the test again

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
right now and I did the test again
afterwards<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.100> iPhone<00:01:08.369> 5

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
afterwards and you can see the iPhone 5

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
afterwards and you can see the iPhone 5
was<00:01:08.880> actually<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> faster<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> HTC

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
was actually the faster one but the HTC

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
was actually the faster one but the HTC
one<00:01:11.159> started<00:01:11.610> off<00:01:11.670> fast<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> started

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
one started off fast and then it started

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
one started off fast and then it started
slower<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> think<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
slower but I think this is the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
slower but I think this is the
developers<00:01:14.970> problem<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.689> their

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
developers problem with their

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
developers problem with their
application<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
application and not the speed of the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.359 
application and not the speed of the
phone's<00:01:18.060> themself<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.740> next<00:01:19.979> test<00:01:20.189> we're

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
phone's themself the next test we're

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
phone's themself the next test we're
gonna<00:01:20.460> run<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.350> html5<00:01:22.350> test<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
gonna run here is the html5 test that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.190 
gonna run here is the html5 test that
you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.189> run<00:01:23.400> through<00:01:23.610> any<00:01:23.820> browser<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you can run through any browser and you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980 
you can run through any browser and you
can<00:01:25.320> tell<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.040> HTC<00:01:26.610> One<00:01:27.060> definitely

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
can tell that the HTC One definitely

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
can tell that the HTC One definitely
scored<00:01:28.290> higher<00:01:28.470> now<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> did<00:01:29.130> test<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.000> with

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
scored higher now I did test this with

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
scored higher now I did test this with
chrome<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> HTC<00:01:31.619> One<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.670> gonna

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
chrome on the HTC One and I'm gonna

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
chrome on the HTC One and I'm gonna
switch<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.020> stock<00:01:34.380> browser<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
switch over to the stock browser that

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
switch over to the stock browser that
comes<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> HTC<00:01:36.420> One<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> actually

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
comes with the HTC One and it actually
