00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.710
 there are very good to all kids I am 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.360
 mochi and today finally after much 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.499
 time I'm going to do a tutorial of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.320
 redstone but before I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:23.170
 I'm thinking of a 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.550
 in a possible special of life but 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.310
 for this I need you to do me 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.410
 questions and if you can I would appreciate it if 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.200
 me 16 questions either on twitter or by 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.620
 the comments that I read all 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.870
 and with that said let's start with the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 tutorial 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.110
 I'm going to show you this trap here 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.110
 The first thing you have to do is a 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.970
 is a square of 8 x 8 and of 3 towards 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.970
 down 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.949
 all this you are going to have to remove 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.460
 I'm going to cut the video and when I 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.229
 have empty I come back 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.390
 well once you have removed all 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.090
 the blocks we are going to place in the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 center of the square for it you are going to 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.150
 go one to a corner you are going to count three 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.770
 blocks diagonally and in the room 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.539
 you make a brand 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.830
 so it would be that this is the 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.620
 center 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 and for example if you want to do this 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.570
 trap and you have your house 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.570
 you have the door here a little weird 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:45.690
 good because I do not know 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.530
 good if you have that rare door 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.530
 you are going to 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 on the right and the left you leave here 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.550
 a space and you are going to put four here 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.450
 sticky pistons here other four 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.450
 and here 2 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.030
 here you are going to put four blocks like this 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 and another four if the soil is this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.650
 type of block 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.190
 denis do them here if it were stone 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 stone and so 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.880
 you are going to put a block here here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.030
 here and here 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.760
 now we repeaters have to 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.390
 put the repeaters 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.480
 and that can with the corner is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.780
 so antich so that they remain of this 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.780
 shape 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.230
 and here the same 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.510
 let's put here two repeaters 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.870
 here two more 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.470
 now it would be to put one of the rest over 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.470
 of these corners 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.530
 and connected everything like here I can not 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.830
 paste the rest we removed these four 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 blocks 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.010
 and we passed the current 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.010
 around the edge of the square 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.820
 we're 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.460
 and we would have made our trap 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.460
 let's see what works 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:41.080
 well you can cover this you have to 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.430
 cover you would have to raise the current 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.430
 herself mind 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.730
 go up here the current 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.730
 and you could have your lever here 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.090
 I would make this happen 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.069
 all right 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.409
 this has been the tutorial of today remember 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.150
 what about the questions please if you can 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.709
 I would really appreciate it if you made me 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.960
 Jce questions on twitter or by the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.970
 comments 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.560
 and I hope that today's tutorial has 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 liked and until the next video
