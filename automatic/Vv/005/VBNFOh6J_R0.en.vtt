back and we're going to cook these the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.359 
back and we're going to cook these the
mistake<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.869> people<00:02:04.989> make<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.590> they<00:02:05.619> um<00:02:06.009> they

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
mistake that people make is they um they

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.190 
mistake that people make is they um they
think<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.149> they're<00:02:07.329> cooking<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.750> sardines

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
think that they're cooking the sardines

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.420 
think that they're cooking the sardines
on<00:02:08.410> their<00:02:08.560> own<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.789> like<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.929> fire

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
on their own just like that in the fire

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.009 
on their own just like that in the fire
so<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.519> basically<00:02:12.640> obviously<00:02:13.599> make<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> fire

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
so you basically obviously make a fire

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.960 
so you basically obviously make a fire
um<00:02:14.310> next<00:02:15.310> thing<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.519> want<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> make<00:02:15.819> sure<00:02:15.849> is

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
um next thing you want to make sure is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.819 
um next thing you want to make sure is
you<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.150> enough<00:02:16.329> inventory<00:02:16.599> space<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:17.739> the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
you have enough inventory space for the

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.809 
you have enough inventory space for the
fish<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.069> actually<00:02:18.430> fall<00:02:18.610> into<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.610> take

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
fish to actually fall into so you take

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.160 
fish to actually fall into so you take
your<00:02:21.940> knife<00:02:22.060> or<00:02:22.209> your<00:02:22.329> machete<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.870> go

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
your knife or your machete and you go

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.720 
your knife or your machete and you go
over<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.440> fish<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.010> sardines<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.640> you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
