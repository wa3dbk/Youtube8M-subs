exactly<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.090> weak<00:03:52.480> move<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.000> have<00:03:55.120> no<00:03:55.209> idea

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
exactly a weak move so I have no idea

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.690 
exactly a weak move so I have no idea
why<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.720> did<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.079> little<00:03:56.430> aside<00:03:57.430> from<00:03:57.549> the

why that did so little aside from the

that<00:05:39.730> very<00:05:40.730> much<00:05:40.940> I<00:05:41.560> mean<00:05:42.560> all<00:05:42.740> ideas<00:05:43.040> are

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
that very much I mean all ideas are

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.500 
that very much I mean all ideas are

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
probably gonna be purified off screen

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.130 
probably gonna be purified off screen
will<00:05:44.690> implant<00:05:44.990> training<00:05:45.470> on<00:05:45.560> about<00:05:46.190> battle<00:05:47.140> so

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
will implant training on about battle so

00:05:48.140 --> 00:06:02.180 
will implant training on about battle so
you're<00:05:48.440> not<00:05:48.530> gonna<00:05:48.710> be<00:05:48.830> seeing<00:05:49.040> much<00:05:49.250> of<00:05:49.280> that

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.530 

can't<00:06:03.190> say<00:06:03.340> I'm<00:06:03.430> surprised<00:06:03.820> still<00:06:04.330> very

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
can't say I'm surprised still very

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.570 
can't say I'm surprised still very
irritating

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.850 

I<00:06:10.610> think<00:06:11.599> I<00:06:11.690> can<00:06:11.780> get<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:11.930> quick<00:06:12.139> attacking<00:06:12.710> on

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
I think I can get a quick attacking on

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:22.240 
I think I can get a quick attacking on
there<00:06:13.190> if<00:06:13.879> I'm<00:06:14.120> feeling<00:06:14.690> lucky

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.640 

we<00:06:22.760> are<00:06:22.820> they're<00:06:22.970> doing<00:06:23.000> much<00:06:23.210> so<00:06:24.200> that<00:06:24.350> this

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
we are they're doing much so that this

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.010 
we are they're doing much so that this
isn't<00:06:24.950> exactly<00:06:25.190> a<00:06:25.580> hard<00:06:25.760> fight<00:06:26.030> what<00:06:26.600> makes<00:06:26.840> it

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
isn't exactly a hard fight what makes it

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.990 
isn't exactly a hard fight what makes it
irritating<00:06:27.590> is<00:06:27.740> that<00:06:27.890> it's<00:06:28.010> right<00:06:28.190> before<00:06:28.400> a

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
irritating is that it's right before a

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.060 
irritating is that it's right before a
boss<00:06:29.450> fight<00:06:29.750> and<00:06:30.050> there's<00:06:30.350> no<00:06:30.440> chance<00:06:30.740> for

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
boss fight and there's no chance for

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.650 
boss fight and there's no chance for
saving<00:06:31.820> or<00:06:32.060> healing<00:06:32.390> or<00:06:32.540> whatnot<00:06:32.720> in<00:06:33.320> between

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
saving or healing or whatnot in between

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.090 
saving or healing or whatnot in between
so<00:06:35.660> you<00:06:35.690> kind<00:06:36.170> of<00:06:36.260> want<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.500> keep<00:06:36.620> things<00:06:36.920> alive

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
so you kind of want to keep things alive

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:49.120 
so you kind of want to keep things alive
and<00:06:37.640> in<00:06:37.760> decent<00:06:37.970> condition<00:06:45.430> gotcha<00:06:47.920> only<00:06:48.920> one

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130
