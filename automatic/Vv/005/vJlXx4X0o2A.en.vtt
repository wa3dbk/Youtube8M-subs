00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.520
 screen 4 emulators the one from psp the one from 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.430
 game boy advance that of the nintendo 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.650
 dsi that of nintendo and you can click 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 there on the screen the squares and the 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.660
 is going to take the video to be checked 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.060
 is very very good and in this case it is the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.370
 same from psp but now for 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.920
 devices with android ok is very 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.290
 good very easy to download and is very 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.840
 very father the game and well then we are going to 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.920
 start once this the first thing that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.380
 we are going to need ok are this a 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.830
 program to pass or transfer 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.840
 files on your android device 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.430
 I am occupying this application 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.080
 to transfer android files but 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.119
 in the mac I think it is also 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 available for windows so as is 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.030
 is the name so they copy it and stick it 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.890
 in google and anyway I leave them 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.920
 the link 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.810
 the page that is here but in this 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.600
 case I think it 's for mac and they click 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 in download here dolÃ³n now and ready go to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.840
 can unload it decompress and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.400
 remember that always in the mac les 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.010
 it appears that you can not open the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.570
 file not because it's damaged or something 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.640
 but because he has to activate this 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.260
 they click on the lock they will ask 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.840
 your password and have to allow 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 applications from any site ok no 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.209
 There is nothing wrong with it and they can do it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.880
 is very very father and then here is already 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.670
 since they have this program the other 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.519
 what are we going to need is this 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.640
 simply from where we are going to download 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.830
 the games we are going to get exactly 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 how are you looking at the page there from 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.519
 the cult rooms and in this case they are 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.739
 good games for psp and there they will be able 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.800
 download as you are seeing it in your 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.450
 screen they select the game they give in 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.520
 to download 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.739
 This sign will appear 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.739
 of advertising or that of waiting for what 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:16.430
 He spends time and they give you download and 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.980
 ready they will be able to download it and they will 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.840
 appear in a folder after you 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.569
 compressed they decompress it with any 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.280
 decompressed files and it's going to 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.800
 appear already within the folder 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.440
 for example I recorded this bagel of 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.690
 dragon ball z has to be this file 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.930
 that says iso point and that's what it's going to 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.180
 make the game already itself ok then a 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.340
 Once you have already downloaded your game 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.799
 or his games then then now 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.750
 let's see how we are going to install it in 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.060
 the device and for that then we're going to 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.280
 happen to record what is 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.050
 and good once we're here in 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.180
 our device with android we 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.470
 let's go to the play store and we're going to 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.900
 find ps pepe sspp ok we will leave 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.300
 this emulator seems to me already open 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.300
 because I already downloaded it to avoid this 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.150
 time and then already this is going to 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.670
 download and ready is totally free and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.610
 it has no cost ok and good once 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.250
 that have already downloaded it, we're leaving 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:22.019
 to this one as you may realize it is already 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.690
 here and there we're going to do this guy 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.970
 of things ok let's grab and let's 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.639
 open the connecting our device 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.290
 really to the computer and here we are going 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.130
 to appear this part where they are 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.710
 all the files that we have 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.600
 connected in our device all 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.910
 the folders that we have and are going to 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.040
 select where you want to put this 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.110
 what is the game then I'm going to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.910
 select here that is the folder of 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.740
 e-mail but you are free the one 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.010
 they want to select and they go where 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.140
 is your file point did ok and from there 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.300
 and nothing else select this file what 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.729
 drag or copy and paste 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.129
 here they leave it ok or wherever 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.509
 folder that you want and that's it 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.550
 it's all we have to do wait 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.440
 to copy and we're closing these 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.190
 folders that we will not use anything anymore 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.830
 for nothing and let this put you here 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.379
 and we're going to go into what the emulator is 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.900
 ok then let's go see what's going to 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.110
 put state in this way 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.259
 to put it like that and there is already what they are 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:27.780
 the folders I like you saw 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:29.310
 I put it in the folder of y m de s &amp; m 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.169
 and as you can see there is 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.389
 the game of dragon ball if we all go to 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.750
 click on it to see that everything 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:40.430
 works correctly and see there already 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.430
 grabbed what is the game 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.009
 and there it is 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.199
 How can you tell? 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.889
 that is the emulator is more pretty 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.889
 fairly good 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.300
 and obviously we are going to give it a game and 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.580
 all that and then there are already following the 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.990
 steps of what the game is like they can 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.180
 realize works perfectly 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.449
 obviously I 'm not going to keep putting 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.639
 there what is the game 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.180
