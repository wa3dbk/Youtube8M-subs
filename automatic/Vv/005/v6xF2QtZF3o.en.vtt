do is to put a few statements to the
tiles<00:01:08.410> and<00:01:08.650> we'll<00:01:09.040> see<00:01:09.250> where<00:01:09.520> they<00:01:09.640> come<00:01:09.850> up

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
tiles and we'll see where they come up

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.730 
tiles and we'll see where they come up
with<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.210> first<00:01:13.540> off<00:01:13.810> we're<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.230> test<00:01:14.500> a

with so first off we're going to test a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.620 
with so first off we're going to test a

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
could that really be well let's take a

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.080 
could that really be well let's take a
look<00:03:02.109> at<00:03:02.290> less<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:02.859> can<00:03:03.010> find<00:03:03.220> out<00:03:03.549> somehow

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
look at less if we can find out somehow

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.199 
look at less if we can find out somehow
we<00:03:04.599> going<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.139> taste<00:03:05.379> his<00:03:05.650> math<00:03:05.950> well<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:07.000> say

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
we going to taste his math well we say

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.599 
we going to taste his math well we say
already<00:03:07.689> in<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> bottle<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.560> said<00:03:08.889> that<00:03:09.099> the
