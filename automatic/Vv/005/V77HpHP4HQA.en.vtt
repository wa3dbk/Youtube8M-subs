hang<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.580> put<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:20.850> tension<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> wire

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
hang so put a little tension on the wire

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
hang so put a little tension on the wire
and<00:01:22.049> measure<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.850> mark<00:01:24.119> the
