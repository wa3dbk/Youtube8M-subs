00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
rolling out and we got a little pressure

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.320 
rolling out and we got a little pressure
on<00:01:28.100> him<00:01:28.250> I<00:01:28.280> think<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.670> know<00:01:28.850> Chris<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.210> got

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
on him I think you know Chris you got

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.360 
on him I think you know Chris you got
pressure<00:01:29.570> on<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.750> think<00:01:29.930> right<00:01:30.160> Chris<00:01:31.160> was

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
pressure on I think right Chris was

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.550 
pressure on I think right Chris was
crucial<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.790> there<00:01:32.000> he<00:01:32.180> made<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.050> employees

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
crucial in there he made this employees

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.810 
crucial in there he made this employees
and<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.860> know<00:01:33.950> if<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.160> wanted<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.490> great<00:01:34.640> job

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
and you know if you wanted a great job

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.360 
and you know if you wanted a great job
of<00:01:34.880> forcing<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.540> I<00:01:35.570> think<00:01:36.160> that<00:01:37.160> they've

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
of forcing it and I think that they've

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.520 
of forcing it and I think that they've
got<00:01:37.580> underneath<00:01:37.850> me<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.330> then<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:38.570> think<00:01:38.810> you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
got underneath me and then I think you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.720 
got underneath me and then I think you
just<00:01:39.560> rolled<00:01:39.890> out<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.100> was<00:01:40.310> trying<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.520> just

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
just rolled out I was trying to just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.160 
just rolled out I was trying to just
match<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> guy<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.390> was<00:01:41.420> around<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.930> think

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
match the guy that I was around I think

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.210 
match the guy that I was around I think
I<00:01:42.320> think<00:01:42.560> he<00:01:42.620> was<00:01:42.710> trying<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.980> get<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.130> out<00:01:43.160> of

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
I think he was trying to get it out of

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.620 
I think he was trying to get it out of
bounds<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.700> wasn't<00:01:43.970> quite<00:01:44.060> able<00:01:44.240> to<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.600> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
bounds but it wasn't quite able to and I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.480 
bounds but it wasn't quite able to and I
think<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:45.290> know<00:01:45.320> Kevin<00:01:45.800> Kevin<00:01:46.160> was<00:01:46.370> right

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
think you know Kevin Kevin was right

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.130 
think you know Kevin Kevin was right
there<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.090> Dom's<00:01:47.510> right<00:01:47.840> there<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
there to it I think Dom's right there to

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870 
there to it I think Dom's right there to
