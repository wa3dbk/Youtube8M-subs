00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi everyone I'm alex wit crafter 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.799
 we go with a new video tutorial of 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.109
 automatic farms after making the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.289
 of melons and pumpkins wheat 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.689
 with sugar cane well x times that of 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.970
 more and I want to make it as effective 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.520
 possible the cell of my form if 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.050
 they get one is that I say no 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.160
 sorry 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.750
 is that 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 but this is a test for you to see 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 how you have to limit the piston so that 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.960
 do not pass what is going to happen is worth to the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.590
 pistons are powered by torches 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 under equipment and on the other side 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 is powered by repeaters behind 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 they are worth difference here here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.840
 a gap look here there is a here there is not a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.840
 there is not a hole here 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.890
 here you can be trying on seen 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.740
 that the most effective is this one of this 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.060
 side let's see it 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.060
 how do you see jumps 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.860
 but here many of them slip through here 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.000
 because there is a block here I do not know if I 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.980
 I explain and you can strain and here it does not come out 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.770
 but this is not the most effective as 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.630
 see the sides are pieces thing 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.060
 that I do not want so I created the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.060
 most effective of all that is this 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.770
 it's never fails to approve several times 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.880
 but the difference is that it has another 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.270
 piston row and you have two because just 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.880
 we have this style stays on top of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.520
 piston when it is retracted and it falls here 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.950
 what would be in the thing is but if there 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.570
 another place on top does not push and at the same 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.290
 time ago so it makes everything go 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.290
 to water well 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.229
 As you can see I'm going to enter here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.600
 OK 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.440
 here on the side I have not been one 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.310
 neither 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.430
 so you can see all here I think it's a 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 total of 32 and peak this well for the 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.230
 this is fine for mods that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.850
 need a lot of sugar cane or yes that is 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.090
 build a bookstore because it's good for you 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.780
 but there comes a point that they are no longer 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.960
 there is no less we have basic under 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 here there is rest this is like in the last 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.050
 day a signal that arrives here and another that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.060
 go here climb up the rest torches 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.640
 who was here 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.800
 and then it feeds the repeater to this 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.690
 piston and the one below we're going to 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
 learn to build first before 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.330
 nothing we have to put here two of 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.240
 stone 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.340
 but sometimes I would not want 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:03:00.120
 nothing happens here you have to put 8 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.120
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 8 is worth the same here 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.670
 for as you know the water that 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.380
 push 8 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.260
 must reach the limit well 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.850
 now we put here stone we put two of 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.850
 stone from below 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.600
 wrong once we have stone 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.250
 we put two pistons on top of each other 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.250
 see this badly placed 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.160
 well here another and another 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.310
 these are the ones who are going to move the canes 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.870
 of sugar 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.610
 and here same 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.960
 those of stone 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.350
 or any construction material 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.390
 it must be stone it can be wood 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.120
 brick ribbon whatever you want 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.560
 I make stone to make it better 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.560
 and here pistons 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.290
 you are some birds from behind are my 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.290
 nymphs so nothing 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.210
 it already 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.510
 here too 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.500
 and now we cover it basically 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.500
 to make it better 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.159
 well let's go planting so that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.009
 let's see already the height 1 2 3 that is, here 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:31.000
 you have to cover it whole so that 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:32.289
 that has a cap so to speak and that 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.569
 although we already know that it can not grow 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.400
 more then I can not jump up 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.110
 ok do things tiers because if I 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.780
 and we can leave it jumps 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.240
 up to dry the substrate in the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.430
 earth is to say substrate but not 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.470
 ok let's do with the cable 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.470
 reston is worth composing here stone 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.300
 to dead 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.650
 I'm going to do it on the other side 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.740
 Once we have here I am full of 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.690
 stone 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.690
 we do not extend it another cube 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.720
 and we put here a piece there has been 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.750
 there 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.790
 we put repeaters here the frequency 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.140
 it does not matter if we change the frequencies not 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.310
 You will make one active at the same 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.129
 time that another and we connect it we count 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.550
 the torch and we test what's 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.029
 ok now let's make it the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.029
 button 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.330
 is here to not have problems 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.580
 so we make a little hole 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.800
 here we were here we were we put 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.569
 this under 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.129
 I repeated the tip of it so that 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.039
 the signal arrives 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:47.420
 of the block that does not come in here 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:51.050
 another repeater is worth 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.620
 we connect for rest to this block here 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.620
 we put a torch 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.210
 us like this that is on and 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.460
 he turned off 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.080
 and then with the rest here so that 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.689
 when I press the button and it turns on 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.629
 turn on 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.779
 and energy here you have to do both the 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.779
 same 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.810
 here he is missing 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.480
 this 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.260
 and good bye 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.510
 how I have the day was worth 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.960
 now place the piston that I have seen by 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.960
 rest 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:36.460
 and here we put a block of stone 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.560
 below him we are going to prove that it works 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.560
 Cantor girl works 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.340
 they go out 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.050
 these remains up here is worth this already 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.280
 we could cover because we know it's going to 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.889
 function 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.870
 let's see what works 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.940
 if you see that some go faster than 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.040
 others that's the 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.200
 the thing is fine we already have what it is 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.200
 the basic system we will check 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.070
 I do not think I like that everything is 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.070
 equally brave 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:21.529
 and now we're going to end up here 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.529
 this way 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.900
 let's put this here 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.010
 and this here is worth we are going to finish 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.620
 we are already going to close this where not 

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.640
 and let's try 

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:09.000
 good is this the tutorial of the farm of 

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:10.979
 the next sugar factory tutorial 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.919
 it will be a semiautomatic cactus and 

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:16.290
 two different automatic one without text 

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:20.300
 and another with rest the next video will be 

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.300
 for tomorrow and until another
