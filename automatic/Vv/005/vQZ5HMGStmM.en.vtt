00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello i will show you today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.540
 how to do the game match then the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 guen match there it's much simpler 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 that the sencha first put of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.910
 water in the heavy cooler 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.750
 cool hot obviously at the like 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.109
 this then put the water in every 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.080
 cup then the only goal is to 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:30.060
 know the amount of water needed to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 to prepare our infusion here I put 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.600
 then the tea leaves directly 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.300
 in the teapot the equivalent of a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.030
 spoon to a spoon and a half to tea 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 between 6 and 10 grams which equals 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.289
 between 4 and 6 teaspoons 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.879
 tea leaves I put then los 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.879
 zetas directly in the teapot 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.670
 here is one and then I let it infuse 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.020
 about 30 seconds 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.600
 so what is the guen maichan the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.420
 guen match at the base is tinted that is 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.790
 composed of sencha and grains of rice 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.700
 roasted there is no popcorn in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 is silent if you see some grains of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.430
 rice 1 that can explode that looks like 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.110
 popcorn is only rice 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 some manufactures uses a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 quality of what you say 'ben chat ta 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.729
 mayorat only uses 1st t2 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.040
 spring harvest school 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.670
 why we added the match to this 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.950
 preparation 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 it's simply to balance the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 taste and color it harmonizes a small 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.409
 little liquor here is my preparation and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 my infusion is ready 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.740
 I will be able to serve by proceeding from 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 the traditional way that is to say 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 a little bit in each cup tower 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.110
 in turn to balance our liquor 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.610
 each person will have the same intensity 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.610
 in castle his cup 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 here and always until the last 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.910
 drop to recover the most 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.070
 of concentrated elements and then it goes 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.620
 allow us thereafter to 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.700
 reuse our leaves with a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.170
 second and third to merge to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.270
 know that for the second and the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.100
 third a merger a few seconds 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.300
 are enough to prepare your infusion 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300
 that's good tasting
