here<00:00:04.920> we<00:00:05.009> are<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.399> the<00:00:05.520> trunk<00:00:05.760> of<00:00:05.850> an<00:00:05.970> e<00:00:06.029> 38

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
here we are in the trunk of an e 38

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.730 
here we are in the trunk of an e 38
seven<00:00:06.750> series

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
seven series

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.680 
seven series
for<00:00:08.280> multiple<00:00:08.610> purposes<00:00:08.760> we'll<00:00:09.210> start<00:00:09.510> with

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
for multiple purposes we'll start with

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.199 
for multiple purposes we'll start with
just<00:00:10.349> removing<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> trunk<00:00:11.250> getting<00:00:12.089> these

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
just removing the trunk getting these

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:13.940 
just removing the trunk getting these
panels<00:00:12.599> out<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.110> access<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.589> factory

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
panels out so we can access the factory

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.080 
panels out so we can access the factory
amplifier<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:16.340> all<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> wiring<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:17.940> may

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
amplifier and all the wiring that we may

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.390 
amplifier and all the wiring that we may
need<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.600> iPod<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.290> satellite<00:00:19.710> radio<00:00:20.010> or

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
need for an iPod or a satellite radio or

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.250 
need for an iPod or a satellite radio or
an<00:00:20.460> amplifier<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.120> any<00:00:21.390> sort<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.720> integration

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
an amplifier or any sort of integration

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.170 
an amplifier or any sort of integration
so<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.310> very<00:00:23.520> very<00:00:23.670> straightforward

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so it's really very very straightforward

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060 
so it's really very very straightforward
here<00:00:24.720> especially<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.800> doing<00:00:25.890> an

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
here especially if we're doing an

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.680 
here especially if we're doing an
amplifier<00:00:26.520> until<00:00:26.910> everything<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.330> done<00:00:27.480> back

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
amplifier until everything is done back

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.460 
amplifier until everything is done back
here<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.020> trunk

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
here in the trunk

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
here in the trunk
the<00:00:29.460> first<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.790> that<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.030> going<00:00:30.120> to<00:00:30.180> need

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the first thing that we're going to need

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.040 
the first thing that we're going to need
to<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> eject

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
to do is to we're going to want to eject

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.099 
to do is to we're going to want to eject
any<00:00:34.050> CDs<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.739> may<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.249> the<00:00:35.789> CD<00:00:36.059> player

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
any CDs that may be in the CD player

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.930 
any CDs that may be in the CD player
because<00:00:37.109> if<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.410> taking<00:00:37.499> it<00:00:37.769> out<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.879> we

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
because if we're taking it out and we

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.040 
because if we're taking it out and we
take<00:00:39.089> the<00:00:39.179> power<00:00:39.390> away<00:00:39.420> we'll<00:00:39.749> lose<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
take the power away we'll lose it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.779 
take the power away we'll lose it
forever<00:00:40.199> so<00:00:40.589> go<00:00:40.980> ahead<00:00:41.039> and<00:00:41.190> take<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.429> CDs

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
forever so go ahead and take your CDs

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.119 
forever so go ahead and take your CDs
out<00:00:42.409> well<00:00:43.409> think<00:00:43.649> since<00:00:43.829> we're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> be

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
out well think since we're going to be

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
out well think since we're going to be
removing<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.579> navigation<00:00:45.120> unit<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.629> always

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
removing the navigation unit I always

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
removing the navigation unit I always
take<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.679> navigation<00:00:46.829> PD<00:00:47.839> so<00:00:48.839> hit<00:00:49.019> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
take out the navigation PD so hit your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.189 
take out the navigation PD so hit your
eject<00:00:49.409> button<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.859> disc<00:00:50.069> will<00:00:50.219> come<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:51.199> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
eject button the disc will come out in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.230 
eject button the disc will come out in
theory

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.180 

magic<00:00:58.020> comes<00:00:58.320> out

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190

removal tools if you don't have these

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.740 
removal tools if you don't have these
you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.860> four<00:01:17.190> little

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
you can see you just have four little

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.969 
you can see you just have four little
pins<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.350> side<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.800> nav

unit<00:01:20.160> essentially<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.360> doing<00:01:22.970> needs

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
unit essentially what we're doing needs

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.510 
unit essentially what we're doing needs
to<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.479> point<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> snap-in<00:01:25.520> we're

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to go into a point in a snap-in we're

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 
to go into a point in a snap-in we're
just<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> need<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.259> just

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just going in there and we need to just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.670 
just going in there and we need to just
pry<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.580> lock<00:01:29.759> ears<00:01:30.300> inward<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pry the little lock ears inward but to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.810 
pry the little lock ears inward but to
do<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.659> pull<00:01:33.659> outwards<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.399> just<00:01:35.580> Rock

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
do that pull outwards and you just Rock

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
do that pull outwards and you just Rock
the<00:01:36.119> nav<00:01:36.600> unit<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:37.080> as<00:01:37.229> steadily<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.770> possible

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the nav unit out as steadily as possible

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
the nav unit out as steadily as possible
you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.300> we're<00:01:39.450> doing<00:01:39.690> is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
you can see it's all we're doing is

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
you can see it's all we're doing is
closing<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.490> ears<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> let<00:01:42.000> this

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
closing these little ears to let this

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.910 
closing these little ears to let this
slide<00:01:42.330> out<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.720> even<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.470> had<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> coat

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
slide out so even if you had a coat

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
slide out so even if you had a coat
hanger<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:44.910> make<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.330> tool<00:01:45.660> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
hanger you could make a little tool that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
hanger you could make a little tool that
would<00:01:46.380> let<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> nav<00:01:46.920> unit<00:01:47.130> slide<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
would let the nav unit slide out of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.870 
would let the nav unit slide out of
there<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:49.500> by<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.800> nod<00:01:50.070> unit<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.550> course

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there just by the nod unit out of course

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.279 
there just by the nod unit out of course
and<00:01:51.210> you'll<00:01:51.330> unplug<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.929> key<00:01:52.170> with

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
and you'll unplug it and the key with

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.230

now<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.319> we've<00:03:32.530> got<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.799> freed<00:03:33.040> up<00:03:33.220> out<00:03:33.430> of

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
now that we've got it freed up out of

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:33.869 
now that we've got it freed up out of
there

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
there

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.399 
there
easiest<00:03:34.569> thing<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.689> do<00:03:34.840> at<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:34.989> point<00:03:35.200> is

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
easiest thing to do at this point is

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.379 
easiest thing to do at this point is
these<00:03:36.220> little<00:03:36.370> black<00:03:36.609> fasteners<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.359> are

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
these little black fasteners that are

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.849 
these little black fasteners that are
back<00:03:37.569> here<00:03:37.750> we<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:37.959> two<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.260> them<00:03:38.379> one<00:03:38.680> and

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
back here we have two of them one and

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.240 
back here we have two of them one and
two<00:03:39.040> just<00:03:39.969> unscrew<00:03:40.480> them<00:03:41.250> this

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
two just unscrew them this

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.649 
two just unscrew them this
counterclockwise<00:03:42.730> I'm<00:03:43.150> screwing<00:03:43.480> with<00:03:43.540> your

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
counterclockwise I'm screwing with your

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.290 
counterclockwise I'm screwing with your
fingers

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
fingers

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.430 
fingers
and<00:03:45.690> we're<00:03:45.810> going<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:45.960> get<00:03:46.050> these<00:03:46.200> out<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.350> here

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
and we're going to get these out of here

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.840 
and we're going to get these out of here
so<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:46.920> remove<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.400> carpeted

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
so we can just remove this carpeted

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.130 
so we can just remove this carpeted
panel<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.270> we<00:03:48.330> can<00:03:48.480> do<00:03:48.600> all<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> work<00:03:48.990> we<00:03:49.110> need

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
panel and we can do all the work we need

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.900 
panel and we can do all the work we need
to<00:03:49.380> do<00:03:49.560> without<00:03:50.340> having<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.610> take<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.880> whole

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
to do without having to take the whole

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.520 
to do without having to take the whole
trunk<00:03:51.240> apart<00:03:52.100> it's<00:03:53.100> much<00:03:53.310> easier<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.380> get

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
trunk apart it's much easier so get

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.920 
trunk apart it's much easier so get
these<00:03:55.680> guys<00:03:55.860> removed

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
this is also where we would put our

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.170 
this is also where we would put our
Bluetooth<00:04:10.079> modules<00:04:10.739> or<00:04:10.890> any<00:04:11.730> number<00:04:12.150> of

changer behind the CD changer is the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.050 
changer behind the CD changer is the
factory<00:04:29.590> amplifier<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.700> that's<00:04:30.820> we're<00:04:30.940> going

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
factory amplifier and that's we're going

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.400 
factory amplifier and that's we're going
to<00:04:31.120> be<00:04:31.210> making<00:04:31.330> connections<00:04:32.110> for<00:04:32.320> our

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
to be making connections for our

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.590 
to be making connections for our
subwoofer<00:04:32.920> installation<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.110> for<00:04:35.440> the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
subwoofer installation and then for the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.940 
subwoofer installation and then for the
Bluetooth<00:04:37.600> modules<00:04:38.170> they<00:04:38.290> all<00:04:38.440> go<00:04:38.590> back<00:04:38.740> here

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
Bluetooth modules they all go back here

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.320 
Bluetooth modules they all go back here
you<00:04:38.980> can<00:04:39.130> see<00:04:39.190> this<00:04:39.370> card<00:04:39.580> he<00:04:39.700> has<00:04:39.730> bluetooth

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
you can see this card he has bluetooth

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.230 
you can see this card he has bluetooth
in<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:42.400> here's<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.730> voice<00:04:43.000> recognition

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
in it so here's the voice recognition

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.440 
in it so here's the voice recognition
box<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.140> Bluetooth<00:04:44.320> modules<00:04:44.830> back<00:04:44.980> there

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
box and the Bluetooth modules back there

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.580

so everything is going to live back here
in<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.980> front<00:04:48.160> of<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.280> trunk

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
in the front of the trunk

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.860 
in the front of the trunk
this<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.030> also<00:04:49.180> where<00:04:49.390> we're<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.750> make
