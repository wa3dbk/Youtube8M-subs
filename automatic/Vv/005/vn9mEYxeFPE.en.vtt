 I can find a filter here 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.990
 put 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.849
 For example, I want only free 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010

 all the apps are displayed to my search 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.530
 fit 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.550
 when I go to a certain visit 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.510
 it already when I'm on the home page of 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.040
 Detailed overview I displayed 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.110
 or the reviews of other users 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.910
 If I look for the app 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.660
 I decided to click here 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.910

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.680
