blue<00:01:04.530> side<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:07.590> searing<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
blue side of the searing if you have a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
blue side of the searing if you have a
very<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:10.650> big<00:01:10.890> screen<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
very good our big screen you can see the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
very good our big screen you can see the
red<00:01:12.350> over<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.939> as<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:16.409> cool<00:01:16.619> place

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
red over there and as we find cool place

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.510 
red over there and as we find cool place
and<00:01:17.220> let's<00:01:18.210> say<00:01:18.799> over<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:19.950> seems<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and let's say over there seems to be a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450 
and let's say over there seems to be a
desert<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> might<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.460> green

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
desert so I might actually do the green

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.390 
desert so I might actually do the green
baize<00:01:23.670> our<00:01:23.970> yellow<00:01:24.150> base<00:01:24.390> over<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
baize our yellow base over there and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.490 
baize our yellow base over there and
we're<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> establish<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.479> pays<00:01:27.750> based

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
we're going to establish like pays based

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.590 
we're going to establish like pays based
on<00:01:28.680> color<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:30.420> lots<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> different<00:01:31.380> place<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
on color in lots of different place and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600 
on color in lots of different place and
these<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.200> linked<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.710> subway<00:01:35.250> station

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
these will be linked with subway station

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
these will be linked with subway station
station<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> one

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
a bit about it it's right here on every

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.319 
a bit about it it's right here on every
side<00:01:48.240> there's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.630> ladder<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> here

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
side there's a ladder so just like here

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.100 
side there's a ladder so just like here
so<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.850> it's<00:01:56.850> kind<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> easy<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.930> find

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
so it's not it's kind of easy to find

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.830 
so it's not it's kind of easy to find
where<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> climb<00:01:59.130> inside<00:01:59.460> down

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
where to climb inside down

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.600 
where to climb inside down
okay<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:01.900> this<00:02:02.229> is<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.409> subway<00:02:02.830> station<00:02:03.340> the

cactus<00:04:00.220> farm<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.760> then<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:01.120> could<00:04:01.269> have

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
cactus farm and then we could have

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.860 
cactus farm and then we could have
different<00:04:03.090> different<00:04:04.090> type<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.299> item<00:04:04.720> up

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
different different type of item up

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.620 
different different type of item up
grinders<00:04:05.579> but<00:04:06.579> i'm<00:04:06.819> actually<00:04:07.090> talking<00:04:07.420> about

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
grinders but i'm actually talking about

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.149 
grinders but i'm actually talking about
grinders<00:04:08.049> when<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.380> find<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.620> dungeon<00:04:08.799> because

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
grinders when you find a dungeon because

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.630 
grinders when you find a dungeon because
i<00:04:09.340> don't<00:04:09.790> i<00:04:09.940> don't<00:04:09.970> want<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.330> be<00:04:10.420> like<00:04:10.629> I

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
i don't i don't want to be like I

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.330 
i don't i don't want to be like I
I<00:04:12.700> think<00:04:13.450> building<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.020> other<00:04:14.590> mob<00:04:14.890> grinders

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
I think building the other mob grinders

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.259 
I think building the other mob grinders
like<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.910> big<00:04:16.090> towers<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:17.440> kinda<00:04:18.000> removed<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
like the big towers it kinda removed the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.330 
like the big towers it kinda removed the
the<00:04:20.049> fun<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.560> actually<00:04:20.859> trying<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.130> find<00:04:21.280> a

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
the fun of actually trying to find a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.360 
the fun of actually trying to find a
dungeon<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.910> guest<00:04:22.240> establish<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.190> new

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
dungeon and guest establish like a new

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.270 
dungeon and guest establish like a new
base<00:04:24.780> around<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:26.260> specific<00:04:26.770> map<00:04:26.920> grinders

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
base around your specific map grinders

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.130 
base around your specific map grinders
and<00:04:27.430> stuff<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:27.910> won't<00:04:28.150> build<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.600> huge<00:04:28.900> one

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
and stuff so we won't build a huge one

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.130 
and stuff so we won't build a huge one
that<00:04:29.560> will<00:04:29.740> use<00:04:30.300> darkness<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.510> spawn<00:04:31.720> monsters

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
that will use darkness to spawn monsters

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.860 
that will use darkness to spawn monsters
we're<00:04:32.380> going<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> use<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:34.030> one<00:04:34.180> from<00:04:34.240> the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
we're going to use the one from the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.340 
we're going to use the one from the
dungeons<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.380> stuff<00:04:35.760> so<00:04:36.900> this<00:04:37.900> is<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.169> for<00:04:38.290> now

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
dungeons and stuff so this is it for now

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.200 
dungeons and stuff so this is it for now
this<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.520> for<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.790> blue<00:04:39.970> part<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
this is it for the blue part of the

so i'm gonna leave the world untouch i'm

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.219 
so i'm gonna leave the world untouch i'm
going<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.030> only<00:05:34.180> prepare<00:05:34.660> stuff<00:05:34.930> for<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.200> guys

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.060 
going to only prepare stuff for you guys
and<00:05:36.090> after<00:05:37.090> that<00:05:37.120> see<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.830> first

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
and after that see this is the first

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.969 
and after that see this is the first
building<00:05:39.340> for<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.729> red<00:05:39.940> place<00:05:40.240> it's<00:05:40.740> this<00:05:41.740> one

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
building for the red place it's this one

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.740 
building for the red place it's this one
I<00:05:42.160> think<00:05:42.400> will<00:05:42.520> be<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.090> transition

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
I think will be the transition

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.560 
I think will be the transition
transition<00:05:44.560> between<00:05:45.130> all<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.700> cards<00:05:46.360> and

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
transition between all the cards and

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.469 
transition between all the cards and
stuff<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.500> we're<00:05:47.680> going<00:05:47.770> to<00:05:47.860> have<00:05:47.890> rails<00:05:48.479> rail

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
stuff so we're going to have rails rail

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.740 
stuff so we're going to have rails rail
system<00:05:49.930> coming<00:05:50.710> coming<00:05:51.490> here<00:05:51.970> this<00:05:52.450> would<00:05:52.660> be

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
system coming coming here this would be

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.190 
system coming coming here this would be
like<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.900> biggest<00:05:53.200> subway<00:05:54.010> station<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:55.200> I'm
