00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.830
 the technique was passed on to the Arabs who soon began to make each ice 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 calls much later she became the famous solvents 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.759
 French without milk 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 the sound also 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.640
 but it was in 1290 and 2 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.240
 this time it began to take the form of the one we know today 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.939
 when famous traveler taliano marcopolo 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.089
 returned to his country from a trip to China full of news 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.000
 one of them the ice cream made with milk 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.230
 from then the ice cream began to be much consumed in all of Italy and 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 until today I am vegetarian is recognized as one of the best in the world 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 over there anywhere 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.719
 you can find a gelateria 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.390
 or an ice cream shop 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.190
 from Italy, the consumption of ice cream spread throughout Europe until 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.060
 the English took him to the United States 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.410
 there and solvents won important chapters 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.840
 the advent of ice cream in the country that now makes the most solvent inroads in the world 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.380
 was marked by two important facts the construction of the first factory of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.420
 solvents in history which made possible large-scale production 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.860
 number of customers 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.289
 and the invention of refrigerators that if they did not exist 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.379
 people living in hot places would have to travel many kilometers 

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:21.619
 to take a simple agent 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.149
 in Brazil the news of the first solvent sold comes from rio de janeiro 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.709
 an American ship called Madagascar landed in the city in August 1834 with 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.190
 217 tonnes of ice 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.820
 two Rio merchants bought the cargo and on August 23 began to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.480
 sell fruit ice cream in the cariocas so that the product does not melt it 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.220
 was involved in sawing and buried in large stages so it could be kept 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.840
 for 4 to 5 months the servant in Brazil marks the female right to attend 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.010
 confectionery and confectionery before ice cream 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.780
 the act prohibited by the female class 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.560
 but when she learned that she arrived in the country, women started to invade these 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.260
 places to savor frozen 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.460
 at the time there was no such scenario with frozen solvent 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 and so had to be taken soon after the preparation an announcement warned the 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.609
 exact manufacturing time 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.259
 in SÃ£o Paulo the first news about the ice cream that has been registered 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.899
 is from an advertisement in the newspaper the province of sÃ£o paulo of January 4, 1978 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:30.739
 who said smiling every day at 3 o'clock in the right street number 14 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.540
 currently the country's ice cream industry is worth R $ 1 2 million 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.959
 consumption per capita increased by 20 7% in eight years in 2002 each 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.489
 Brazil consumes 4 liters per year last year, and reached more than 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.989
 of 5 liters and the estimate is that in 2010 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.069
 the consumption reaches six liters as an increase of 15% 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.440
 to maintain health consummation teeth in moderation 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.500
 and preferably fruit
