00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
this will go so let's try this I know

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.390 
this will go so let's try this I know
I've<00:02:18.400> done<00:02:18.640> some<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.180> these<00:02:19.360> before<00:02:20.400> there

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
I've done some of these before there

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790 
I've done some of these before there
I've<00:02:21.580> got<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.940> one<00:02:22.350> well<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.470> was<00:02:23.590> easy

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
I've got this one well that was easy

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.860 
I've got this one well that was easy
though

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
though

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680 
though
that's<00:02:25.870> easier<00:02:26.170> than<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.380> last<00:02:26.560> one<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:28.540> then

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
that's easier than the last one and then

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.090 
that's easier than the last one and then
put<00:02:28.930> all<00:02:28.960> these<00:02:29.170> inside

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100
