 hi dear kucherenko you look like 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.139
 video today you will meet 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.919
 SLR camera never did it 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:15.639
 closing space for model range 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.890
 companies which field is most in demand 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.509
 among lovers 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 m 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 from its predecessor d5000 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.689
 the new model features a slightly thinner 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.050
 dimensions and weight 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.480
 materials and build quality are gorgeous 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.110
 like a budget camera 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.510
 photographers with small and medium 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.490
 hands new should fit well leader 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.560
 economy of cameras 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.129
 Nikonov 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.620
 as always on top but the person with the hands 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.159
 shovels will not be delighted 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.750
 sprawling pinky body 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.040
 the most noticeable difference is never this 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.540
 table 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.339
 not only the water of five thousandth 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.939
 but the reaction on the mirrors by anyone 

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:54.439
 swivel vga display is possibly the most 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.100
 good location 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.280
 and the hinge mechanism at all 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.030
 viewing angles close maximum 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 it can turn 180 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.480
 degrees on one of the articles and along with those 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.740
 someone else 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.700
 competitors have implemented this approach 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.880
 for a long time but it does not cancel the joy 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 brand fans 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.670
 there is a key on the top 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.420
 power on combined with shutter release button 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.730
 display information 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.390
 exposure compensation choice 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.370
 aperture 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.980
 video recording screaming adventure mode 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.750
 fished near the crackle of mode selection 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 about the implementation of controls 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.070
 connected video recording we have some 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.090
 claims 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 then the company's engineers had to take off 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.050
 such a good combination wailed 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.560
 seen and buttons for all the videos for older kids 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.930
 canary even junior d300 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.970
 if the lever is still blindly possible like that 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.609
 have experience 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.349
 so on the indicator is lost next to 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.140
 two others of the same size and shape 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.780
 back panel has changed a bit 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.719
 by moving the buttons to the left of the country 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.039
 and now there is a mechanism in it but 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.729
 make you get used to it for a long time 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.439
 all controls successfully 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.570
 located 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.490
 near the side of the flash is 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.530
 flash key and flash compensation item 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 and where is the substitute button 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.670
 flocks then you ask 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.470
 the engineers thought that this segment 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.180
 cameras the user is not often going to field with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.609
 this 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.619
 unnecessary features and hid everything 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:14.709
 canceled the rest 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.730
 not a very wise decision but there is a way 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.310
 assigning functional 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.989
 keys change ayatskov 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.510
 so without taking your eyes off 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.700
 the applicant can be thumb left 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.799
 hands and easy to carry 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.689
 manipulations with the given parameters 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.180
 only when used 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.010
 heavy collectives such a focus is not 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 pass the camera outweighs the side 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.439
 the lens so he brought it down 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.389
 lenses down and only then from mexico 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.869
 under the cap on the left placed beat her 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:40.569
 output 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.020
 idea may connector 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.960
 port for connecting an external microphone with 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.589
 using the usual decreases 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.709
 and combined sport express hand 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.919
 proton pm 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.859
 promised stub right lonely 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.239
 Prev from sd memory card 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.239
 1300 mm 5 hours battery 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.050
 enough for 600 700 shots 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.359
 and even thousands more gently 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.479
 cc 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.010
 on the mode disk added seconds effect 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.709
 by which the image can 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.580
 put a variety of effects in real 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.289
 of time 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:13.500
 especially worth noting the effect of macro 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.630
 possibility to select area planes 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.009
 filter application 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.759
 the same can be done after 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.399
 shooting in the processing menu 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:21.899
 once every model foot 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.289
 becoming more saturated 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.029
 there are options available to you 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:27.199
 color correction 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.669
 image processing 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.429
 and even rub envelopes with minimal 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.759
 required list of settings 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.419
 on days when 5,100 is very well implemented 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.750
 brush mode 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.090
 in the menu you can put it in the exposure 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.050
 for two years for defeats step by 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.860
 one to three degrees as well 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.370
 the degree of decomposition of transitions between 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.569
 light areas of the scene 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.459
 in fact, such a survey does not represent 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.759
 nothing complicated even for the unprepared 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.709
 users 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.979
 who can shoot you can dream and his 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.559
 two steam car two seconds of processing and you 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.589
 ready and the picture of which can 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:00.959
 surprise your friends and acquaintances

 nikaba catastrophes similar to that 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.129
 used up to 7 thousand is one 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.679
 of the best on the market 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:11.769
 sensitivity to the suit remains up 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.540
 up to six thousand three hundred units

 no gain mode haya 1 dashing 2 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.350
 the value of this speed a seid 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.040
 does space that two thousand 300 units 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.990
 in night vision mode in which 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.189
 write only black and white picture 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.259
 for the first time budget segment brought 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.999
 cameras which you can customize the author

 search 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.720
 set the aperture priority and generally 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.980
 forget about the technical side of photography 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.249
 and pays all his attention to creativity 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.529
 for lovers of making movies never and 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.309
 presented carriage prepared 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.579
 can connect an external microphone 

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:43.429
 use swivel display 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:45.869
 while recording worker and fish 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:48.119
 relatively fast autofocus 

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.649
 the camera allows you to record video 

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:52.650
 photo and video of all possible modes 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.720
 to all this effect superimposed on 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.639
 real-time photographs 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.159
 also available for video mode 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.419
 as in previous models of its mode 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.650
 has bugs 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.740
 for given aperture value in the process 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.520
 sightings 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.979
 does not change the depth 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.960
 sharpness and expedition pictures 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.520
 in the end, you have to turn it off and on 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.499
 mode to see real results

 to buyers 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.800
 m became 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.370
 the flaws we have found are 3 cavils 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.960
 what are the real reasons to 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.520
 refuse to purchase so successfully 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.349
 products 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.699
 The beta test model is uniquely unique. 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.809
 succeeded and will be very popular as among 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:35.379
 newbies so Lipchanok enthusiasts 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.139
 thanks to a well thought out and 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:38.669
 balanced performance
