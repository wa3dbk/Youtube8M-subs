seven or it could be like the Galaxy
Note<00:01:57.659> 5.3<00:01:58.530> inch<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.979> when<00:01:59.520> they're<00:01:59.670> getting

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
Note 5.3 inch and when they're getting

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.569 
Note 5.3 inch and when they're getting
like<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.920> good<00:02:02.130> PP

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
like that then you know you get good PP

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.999 
like that then you know you get good PP
PP<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> know<00:02:03.719> pixels<00:02:04.049> per<00:02:04.200> inch<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
PP I you know pixels per inch but you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.910 
PP I you know pixels per inch but you
would<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.640> ppi<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.110> compete<00:02:07.590> with

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
would get a ppi they can compete with

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.590 
would get a ppi they can compete with
iphone<00:02:08.459> 4s<00:02:09.060> when<00:02:09.360> you're<00:02:09.539> getting<00:02:09.840> down

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
iphone 4s when you're getting down

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.050 
iphone 4s when you're getting down
in<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.780> little<00:02:11.080> lower<00:02:11.230> to<00:02:11.530> like<00:02:11.680> 4.3<00:02:12.370> inch<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.970> it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
in a little lower to like 4.3 inch so it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.430 
in a little lower to like 4.3 inch so it
seems<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.540> one's<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:13.990> come<00:02:14.230> out

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
seems like this one's going to come out

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.140 
seems like this one's going to come out
with<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.770> 4.3<00:02:15.430> inch<00:02:15.670> screen<00:02:15.790> 1280<00:02:16.780> x<00:02:17.200> 720<00:02:17.710> p<00:02:18.340> or

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
with a 4.3 inch screen 1280 x 720 p or

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.140 
with a 4.3 inch screen 1280 x 720 p or
yeah<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.230> Tom<00:02:20.650> 720p<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:22.000> that's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
yeah but it is Tom 720p I think that's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.070 
yeah but it is Tom 720p I think that's
higher<00:02:22.540> ppi<00:02:23.310> then<00:02:24.310> iphone<00:02:24.940> 4s<00:02:25.330> that's<00:02:25.810> like

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
higher ppi then iphone 4s that's like

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.680 
higher ppi then iphone 4s that's like
the<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.100> second<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> yeah<00:02:28.600> if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the this is the second this is a yeah if

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.570 
the this is the second this is a yeah if
it's<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.080> third<00:02:29.380> phone<00:02:29.650> that's<00:02:30.100> coming<00:02:30.520> out

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
it's a third phone that's coming out

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's a third phone that's coming out
that<00:02:31.210> has<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> better<00:02:31.840> ppi<00:02:32.290> than<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.980> iphone<00:02:33.430> 4s

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
that has a better ppi than the iphone 4s

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.770 
that has a better ppi than the iphone 4s
and<00:02:34.060> often<00:02:35.220> 41<00:02:36.220> gigs<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.580> ram<00:02:36.730> probably<00:02:37.540> and

before it's been like okay you can you
can<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.840> micro<00:03:41.170> SD<00:03:41.230> card<00:03:41.710> but<00:03:41.950> then

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
can get like a micro SD card but then

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.460 
can get like a micro SD card but then
you<00:03:42.250> can't<00:03:42.520> but<00:03:43.240> then<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.600> can<00:03:43.870> only<00:03:44.020> use<00:03:44.200> like
