harder and harder more and more and I'm

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.110 
harder and harder more and more and I'm
up<00:01:22.070> at<00:01:22.190> this<00:01:22.250> point<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:22.640> where<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:22.880> play<00:01:23.030> all

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
up at this point now where we play all

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.900 
up at this point now where we play all
the<00:01:23.240> time<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:26.090> game<00:01:26.240> Starcraft<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.910> it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
the time the game Starcraft is a it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.820 
the time the game Starcraft is a it
works<00:01:29.720> as<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.930> real-time<00:01:30.260> strategy<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:30.800> that

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
works as a real-time strategy so that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.200 
works as a real-time strategy so that
means<00:01:31.100> there's<00:01:31.340> three<00:01:31.610> different<00:01:31.700> races<00:01:32.060> that

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
means there's three different races that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.140 
means there's three different races that
you<00:01:32.360> can<00:01:32.480> be<00:01:32.890> any<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.070> those<00:01:34.220> races<00:01:34.670> all

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
you can be any of those races all

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.250 
you can be any of those races all
slightly<00:01:35.450> different<00:01:35.540> mechanic<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.110> stuff

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
slightly different mechanic and stuff

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.930 
slightly different mechanic and stuff
basically<00:01:36.619> same<00:01:36.800> idea<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.280> start<00:01:37.760> with<00:01:37.850> these

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
basically same idea you start with these

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.910 
basically same idea you start with these
worker<00:01:38.210> units<00:01:38.479> they<00:01:38.690> get<00:01:38.840> resources<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:39.740> then

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
worker units they get resources and then

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.300 
worker units they get resources and then
you<00:01:39.979> use<00:01:40.100> those<00:01:40.250> resources<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:42.190> beat<00:01:43.190> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
you use those resources to beat the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.000 
you use those resources to beat the
other<00:01:43.430> player<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:45.440> rate<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.650> don't<00:01:45.740> really
