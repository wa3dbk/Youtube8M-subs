through<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.550> tube<00:01:45.050> but<00:01:46.050> occasionally<00:01:46.790> this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
through the tube but occasionally this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.300 
through the tube but occasionally this
technique<00:01:48.300> backfires<00:01:54.710> hey<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> everything

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
