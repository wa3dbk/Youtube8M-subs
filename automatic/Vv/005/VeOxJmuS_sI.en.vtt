00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.120
 so again and the worktops recently 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 we did this kitchen set 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 small which asked to do 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.449
 from the array 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.670
 was made of countertops from solid ash 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.920
 to avoid 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 or reducing the possibility of a ship not 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.599
 countertops 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 we applied the following method we are you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.489
 dovetail milled in the worktop 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.489
 have inserted 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:49.440
 dry very tight two bars 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:53.270
 after that stuck thickening on the sides 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 countertops and on the ends of the countertops 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 and stuck in such a way that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.829
 fiber thickenings coincided with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.229
 fiber direction 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:13.770
 we became the top of the tabletop 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:17.430
 set here such guides for 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.340
 hold the table top you are frezers in in 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 them track width and depth 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.850
 matching with inserted 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 bars on the countertop tabletop falls 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 on these guides and fixed below 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
 wood screws 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.689
 only for the inserted 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:54.049
 dovetail bars what it gives us 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:58.850
 it gives us the opportunity to play table tops 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:03.229
 operation time at differential 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:09.679
 temperatures and humidity and so on and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:15.049
 reducing the capacity of the ship is not me 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:21.609
 here as a result we have here 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:26.230
 such a kitchen set made of 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:30.909
 painted ash 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.909
