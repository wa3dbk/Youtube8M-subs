00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.730
 with my heart thrown by Christian 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.739
 baptism 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.250
 dig for the homeland with many today 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.250
 same 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.330
 with 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 and treatment tells me six years ago 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.050
 that I did it because I represent 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.580
 for me the national heavy metal then 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.160
 they are getting them up dearly freed 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.050
 directly round what is the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.630
 national metal for my tattoo this 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.750
 quite new I do not say it because 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.030
 I was looking for something that stops me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.440
 as long as it represents what that band 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.600
 do not express stronger and the subject matter 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.770
 took the triumph theme that's what 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.510
 that marked me a lot 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 with a strong hand does not only represent 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.680
 what is the processed and national kevin 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.659
 but through ricardo through 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.659
 the letters all of us can 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.990
 arise what is the homeland what that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 national feeling through the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 letters know a little more to our 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:58.820
 country and everything that does not tradition through 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:02.870
 stronger than in the year 2000 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:07.670
 with a weekend that is to hear it 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:11.520
 speak louder did not have the disk 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.160
 and today I flavius ​​the lyrics and well what 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.700
 which represented for me the strongest 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.870
 then do not hesitate I went one morning 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.870
 agreement before noon 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.489
 to comment argentinian 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.840
 I think it's the biggest reference 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.190
 national that we have here 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.830
 without a doubt I think that 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.870
 he was the inventor of the pay mail I dare to 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.300
 tell you 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.680
 and honestly for me 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.500
 I am a very thick guy hello my name is 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.810
 sebastián de torcuato and my tattoo 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.810
 home sky referent I play the guitar 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:12.280
 and an autograph 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
 6 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.740
 the truth is a feeling madness 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:31.070
 passion but good no bigger than I am 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.760
 facundo delicious I have tells me this 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:39.440
 tattoo because I felt that the band is 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.830
 that I like that this was in the year 99 and 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.830
 after 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.160
 and as a second 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:03.260
 in 2004 first that tells me and the reason 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.260
 it was fanaticism with the band 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:11.650
 in 2006 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.250
 simply for the Argentina and the same 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.880
 pride I feel the same and in turn it gives 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.790
 the name that has stronger 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.790
 leandro almagro 76 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.400
 rosary beads 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.850
 and I got tattooed 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.240
 in 2002 for feeling crazy and 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.940
 passion above all madness and passion 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.110

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.150
 in the year 97 because the super front for 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.850
 me in many things I was lucky 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.340
 know their lyrics first after their 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.720
 thoughts as people the great poet 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.720
 national is forgive me hours 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:07.229

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.340

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.500
 day the greatest of all 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.340

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.300
 it stays forever 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.160
 it's a weird feeling to get to a place 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.620
 and see that someone has a tattoo with 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.320

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.360
 have the tattoo of others is something 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.360

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.070
 when 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.480
