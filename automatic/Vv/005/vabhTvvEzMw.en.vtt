00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.010
 definitely to have a nutrition 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.530
 conscious the time factor if it influences 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 many times we are not giving him the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.630
 time it takes to have that 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.550
 not nutrition and really eating not 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.789
 it takes as long as for example and 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.259
 prepare or choose and many times it is something 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.019
 of time and it can be done in a 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.000
 practice something very simple reverses the 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.300
 time to go to the super and buy things 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.250
 I know that they do me good or rather I 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.320
 I save that hour and then I'm watching 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.649
 where I take my food would be no 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.100
 then a tip is I go to the super and the 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.489
 next when you go to the super one this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.880
 nutrition health coach I was 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.040
 saying that the best 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 when you go to the super go in the periphery 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.930
 things in the periphery are things 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.180
 the fruit the vegetables the fresher the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.100
 fish the chicken the meat and the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.020
 half is all that is dead 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.460
 a long time or not everything that is 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.590
 dead what has no nutrients what 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.720
 it's not so cool then first tip 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.130
 give time to go to the super or you have to 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.710
 prepare all the welfare is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 preparation as in all 80% of the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.370
 success that you consciously nourish yourself 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.229
 preparation preparation that today calls 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.050
 by phone they bring the super if 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.330
 you do not have any time or go to the super and 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.619
 go around the periphery and quickly buy 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.420
 things that you feel you can take 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.000
 a fruit that you can take or vegetables 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.210
 that is already chopped something you can 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.930
 take away and also see recipes 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.880
 internet and this and see easy recipes 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.130
 prepare because if you already put a little bit of 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.170
 vegetable and you throw some good tuna 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 that's already a meal with protein and 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.310
 vegetables is already healthy enough and it is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 conscious then I think that rather 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.410
 it has a lot to do with the preparation and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 the value that one wants to eat healthy the 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.940
 choice is at that time it's like a 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.340
 blade is a blade where 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.840
 a very practical tip is at that time 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.900
 I'm going to decide what I'm going to eat 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.210
 breathe in and take two minutes and say 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.369
 I'm going to eat that will be good for me 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.690
 eat if the decision is to eat something that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.180
 they are going to do well it 's fine but it was a 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 decision was not on autopilot 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.970
 then one of the enemies of eating 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.820
 autopilot unconscious is the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.790
 first step is we breathe the exercise 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.490
 of mini relaxation breathes account up 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.230
 five and decide what you're going to eat and what 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.910
 will do well is it possible that in the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.210
 week there will be some meals that are not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.950
 so healthy but he decides to have a number of 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.010
 healthy meals a week that's the idea 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.950
