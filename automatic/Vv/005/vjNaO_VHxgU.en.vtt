00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
chance to to acquire a young player

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.070 
chance to to acquire a young player

that's already proven himself to a

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.990 
that's already proven himself to a
pretty<00:01:14.380> decent<00:01:14.830> level<00:01:15.010> in<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.400> league<00:01:15.610> and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
pretty decent level in the league and

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.470 
pretty decent level in the league and
strengthen<00:01:16.450> our<00:01:16.570> roster<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.550> and<00:01:18.550> there's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
strengthen our roster and and there's

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.710 
strengthen our roster and and there's
still<00:01:19.660> a<00:01:19.690> lot<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:19.930> upside<00:01:20.410> there<00:01:20.680> I<00:01:21.510> mean<00:01:22.510> some

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
still a lot of upside there I mean some

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.170 
still a lot of upside there I mean some
of<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.960> players<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.530> were<00:01:24.490> just<00:01:24.730> taken<00:01:25.060> in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
of the players that were just taken in

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.430 
of the players that were just taken in
the<00:01:25.270> draft<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.990> week<00:01:26.500> ago<00:01:28.140> aren't<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.260> whole<00:01:29.380> lot

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
the draft a week ago aren't a whole lot

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.270 
the draft a week ago aren't a whole lot
younger<00:01:30.369> than<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.630> JJ<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.320> he's<00:01:32.470> had<00:01:33.040> three

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
younger than then JJ and he's had three

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.070 
younger than then JJ and he's had three
years<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> league<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.119> been<00:01:34.630> more

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
years in the league and been more

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.070 
years in the league and been more
productive<00:01:35.320> each<00:01:35.740> year<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:37.119> really<00:01:37.780> falls

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
productive each year so it really falls

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.350 
productive each year so it really falls
I<00:01:38.440> think<00:01:39.040> mostly<00:01:39.369> under<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.700> category<00:01:40.270> of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
I think mostly under the category of

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.390 
I think mostly under the category of
just<00:01:40.690> improving<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.830> quality<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.280> your

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
just improving the quality of your

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.550 
just improving the quality of your
roster<00:01:42.880> overall<00:01:43.270> what<00:01:43.930> do<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.050> see<00:01:44.229> JJ

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
roster overall what do you see JJ

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.410 
roster overall what do you see JJ
fitting<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.310> using<00:01:45.610> power<00:01:45.970> forward/center

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
fitting and using power forward/center

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.380 
fitting and using power forward/center
the<00:01:46.840> same<00:01:47.020> time<00:01:47.200> alongside<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.920> Marcus<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.610> odd

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
the same time alongside the Marcus I odd

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.030 
the same time alongside the Marcus I odd
I<00:01:49.660> think<00:01:49.930> its<00:01:50.050> primary<00:01:50.259> position<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.860> power

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
I think its primary position is power

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.300 
I think its primary position is power
forward<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:53.259> course<00:01:53.470> Jason<00:01:53.650> Thompson<00:01:54.009> can

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
forward and of course Jason Thompson can

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.150 
forward and of course Jason Thompson can
play<00:01:54.460> some<00:01:54.520> center<00:01:55.060> as<00:01:55.240> Kevin<00:01:56.140> DeMarcus<00:01:56.680> so<00:01:56.950> I

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
play some center as Kevin DeMarcus so I

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.490 
play some center as Kevin DeMarcus so I
think<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.759> gives<00:01:57.910> us<00:01:58.119> some<00:01:58.509> flexibility<00:01:59.200> some

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
think it gives us some flexibility some

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.730 
think it gives us some flexibility some
depth<00:01:59.740> and<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.780> know<00:02:01.899> a<00:02:01.929> good<00:02:02.200> upgrade<00:02:02.380> on

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
in order to to accomplish this trade

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.480 
in order to to accomplish this trade
today<00:02:51.030> both<00:02:51.480> teams<00:02:51.750> had<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.110> wave<00:02:52.490> physicals

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490

going<00:03:25.620> forward<00:03:25.980> at<00:03:26.130> all<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.290> when<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.440> get

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
going forward at all and so when we get

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.680 
going forward at all and so when we get
to<00:03:28.920> free<00:03:29.130> agency<00:03:29.430> will<00:03:29.850> still<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.269> basically

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
to free agency will still be basically

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.470 
to free agency will still be basically
in<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> same<00:03:30.989> position<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:32.519> have<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.090> go<00:03:33.330> and

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
in the same position we have to go and

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.330 
in the same position we have to go and
make<00:03:33.660> other<00:03:33.870> additions<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.410> roster<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.840> wait

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
make other additions to roster just wait

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.280 
make other additions to roster just wait
let's<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.459> straight

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.960 

well<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.319> think<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.400> situation<00:03:48.030> whether

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
well I think in a situation whether

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.440 
well I think in a situation whether
whether<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.180> are<00:03:52.170> more<00:03:52.950> motivated<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.909> move<00:03:54.209> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
whether you are more motivated to move a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.440 
whether you are more motivated to move a
certain<00:03:54.629> player<00:03:55.080> or<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.209> still

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
certain player or not I think you still

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.869 
certain player or not I think you still
have<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:58.049> sometimes<00:03:58.709> patients<00:03:59.159> to<00:03:59.700> get

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
have to have sometimes patients to get

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.020 
have to have sometimes patients to get
what<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> think<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.379> value<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.190> help<00:04:02.459> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
what you think is value and help that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.600 
what you think is value and help that
will<00:04:03.150> help<00:04:03.329> your<00:04:03.480> roster<00:04:04.099> rather<00:04:05.099> than<00:04:05.340> just

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
will help your roster rather than just

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.140 
will help your roster rather than just
move<00:04:05.909> somebody<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.750> move<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:08.340> mean
