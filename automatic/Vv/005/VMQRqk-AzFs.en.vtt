now you notice here i have d e C sharp

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.740 
now you notice here i have d e C sharp
ba-ba-boom<00:05:33.319> and<00:05:33.949> I<00:05:34.069> have<00:05:34.189> a<00:05:34.219> 33<00:05:34.819> times<00:05:35.090> so<00:05:35.360> one

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
ba-ba-boom and I have a 33 times so one

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.969 
ba-ba-boom and I have a 33 times so one
two<00:05:36.610> three<00:05:37.610> these<00:05:38.479> are<00:05:38.659> triplets<00:05:39.229> so<00:05:39.800> it's

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
two three these are triplets so it's

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.909 
two three these are triplets so it's
triple<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.729> triple<00:05:41.240> chocolate<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.349> you<00:05:42.770> have

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
triple the triple chocolate and you have

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.330 
triple the triple chocolate and you have
a<00:05:42.949> duple<00:05:43.430> here<00:05:43.639> e<00:05:44.020> so<00:05:45.159> than<00:05:47.680> 18<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.159> these<00:05:49.280> are

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
a duple here e so than 18 so these are

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.430 
a duple here e so than 18 so these are
slower<00:05:49.879> than<00:05:50.150> those<00:05:52.810> okay<00:05:53.810> and<00:05:54.050> then

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
slower than those okay and then

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.860 
slower than those okay and then
continuing<00:05:54.889> on<00:05:55.159> at<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.180> end<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.449> box<00:05:56.690> are

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
continuing on at the end of that box are

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.029 
continuing on at the end of that box are
we're<00:05:56.960> going<00:05:57.080> to<00:05:57.139> have<00:05:57.259> the<00:05:57.349> same<00:05:57.590> sort<00:05:57.949> of

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
we're going to have the same sort of

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.930 
we're going to have the same sort of
pattern<00:05:58.330> but<00:05:59.330> different<00:05:59.719> notes<00:06:00.819> so<00:06:01.819> we're

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
pattern but different notes so we're

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.779 
pattern but different notes so we're
gonna<00:06:02.029> have<00:06:02.240> F<00:06:03.849> F<00:06:04.849> gene<00:06:05.500> three<00:06:06.500> times<00:06:06.770> one<00:06:07.219> two

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
gonna have F F gene three times one two

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.659 
gonna have F F gene three times one two
three<00:06:08.479> and<00:06:09.050> then<00:06:09.500> every<00:06:10.810> computing<00:06:12.669> then

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
three and then every computing then

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.369 
three and then every computing then
continuing<00:06:14.180> on<00:06:14.240> we're<00:06:14.419> going<00:06:14.509> to<00:06:14.569> have<00:06:14.779> the

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:15.379 
continuing on we're going to have the

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:18.070 
continuing on we're going to have the
same<00:06:15.590> thing<00:06:15.860> but<00:06:15.889> up<00:06:16.279> a<00:06:16.370> little<00:06:16.580> higher<00:06:16.729> hey<00:06:17.080> B

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
same thing but up a little higher hey B

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.709 
same thing but up a little higher hey B
flat<00:06:18.379> G<00:06:19.009> 3<00:06:19.580> times<00:06:19.849> 10<00:06:21.669> live<00:06:22.669> on<00:06:22.879> the<00:06:23.029> hey<00:06:23.300> there

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
flat G 3 times 10 live on the hey there

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.689 
flat G 3 times 10 live on the hey there
hold<00:06:24.139> it<00:06:24.229> a<00:06:24.379> then<00:06:25.190> we're<00:06:25.310> going<00:06:25.400> to<00:06:25.460> repeat

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
hold it a then we're going to repeat

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.760 
hold it a then we're going to repeat
back<00:06:25.969> but<00:06:26.599> let's<00:06:26.779> tool<00:06:26.960> we've<00:06:27.139> done<00:06:27.289> this<00:06:27.469> far

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
back but let's tool we've done this far

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:34.570 
back but let's tool we've done this far
so

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.730 

home<00:06:35.580> of<00:06:36.120> course<00:06:37.080> it's<00:06:37.290> going<00:06:37.410> to<00:06:37.470> go<00:06:37.560> fast

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
home of course it's going to go fast

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.010 
home of course it's going to go fast
it's<00:06:38.010> the<00:06:38.460> marking<00:06:38.880> is<00:06:39.000> prestissimo<00:06:39.510> you

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
it's the marking is prestissimo you

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.710 
it's the marking is prestissimo you
don't<00:06:40.200> have<00:06:40.440> a<00:06:41.240> faster<00:06:42.240> marking<00:06:44.270> in<00:06:45.270> music

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
don't have a faster marking in music

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.450 
don't have a faster marking in music
than<00:06:45.870> prestissimo<00:06:46.260> that's<00:06:46.710> very<00:06:46.950> very<00:06:47.130> fast

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
than prestissimo that's very very fast

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:56.000 
than prestissimo that's very very fast
so<00:06:52.820> all<00:06:53.820> right<00:06:54.000> this<00:06:54.870> is<00:06:55.020> also<00:06:55.320> sort<00:06:55.560> of<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.770> free

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
so all right this is also sort of a free

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.100 
so all right this is also sort of a free
tempo<00:06:56.430> it's<00:06:56.610> not<00:06:56.760> exactly<00:06:57.330> you<00:06:57.990> know

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
tempo it's not exactly you know

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.660 
tempo it's not exactly you know
metronomic<00:06:58.590> so<00:06:58.980> you<00:06:59.040> have<00:06:59.220> some<00:06:59.400> freedom

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
metronomic so you have some freedom

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.510 
metronomic so you have some freedom
there<00:06:59.940> now<00:07:00.540> I<00:07:01.260> have<00:07:01.380> a<00:07:01.500> repeat<00:07:01.800> back<00:07:02.070> we'd<00:07:02.370> be

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
there now I have a repeat back we'd be

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.640 
there now I have a repeat back we'd be
back<00:07:02.730> where<00:07:02.940> to<00:07:03.420> right<00:07:03.630> here<00:07:04.080> we're<00:07:04.470> going<00:07:04.590> to

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
back where to right here we're going to

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.710 
back where to right here we're going to
the<00:07:04.770> exact<00:07:05.040> same<00:07:05.220> thing<00:07:05.550> but<00:07:06.210> up<00:07:06.390> here<00:07:06.420> in

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
the exact same thing but up here in

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.570 
the exact same thing but up here in
octave<00:07:07.020> higher<00:07:07.050> so<00:07:07.560> let's<00:07:07.740> do<00:07:07.890> that<00:07:13.340> we<00:07:14.340> hold

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.580 
octave higher so let's do that we hold

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.520 
octave higher so let's do that we hold
all<00:07:15.000> right<00:07:15.150> I'm<00:07:15.750> a<00:07:15.780> little<00:07:15.960> sloppy<00:07:16.200> on<00:07:16.410> my

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
all right I'm a little sloppy on my

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.140 
all right I'm a little sloppy on my
notes<00:07:16.770> but<00:07:16.980> I'm<00:07:17.070> just<00:07:17.190> trying<00:07:17.490> to<00:07:17.610> teach<00:07:17.760> it<00:07:17.940> so

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
notes but I'm just trying to teach it so

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.350 
notes but I'm just trying to teach it so
hopefully<00:07:18.690> you'll<00:07:19.020> get<00:07:19.170> it<00:07:19.910> and<00:07:20.910> you<00:07:21.000> notice<00:07:21.180> i

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
hopefully you'll get it and you notice i

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.940 
hopefully you'll get it and you notice i
put<00:07:21.390> a<00:07:21.540> little<00:07:21.570> separation<00:07:22.050> a<00:07:22.500> little<00:07:22.680> space

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
put a little separation a little space

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.550 
put a little separation a little space
between<00:07:23.220> those<00:07:23.760> duple<00:07:24.510> notes<00:07:24.660> because<00:07:25.050> that's

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 
between those duple notes because that's

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.140 
between those duple notes because that's
what<00:07:25.770> you<00:07:25.800> do<00:07:26.100> in<00:07:26.250> Baroque<00:07:26.520> music<00:07:26.550> when<00:07:27.060> you

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
what you do in Baroque music when you

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.580 
what you do in Baroque music when you
have<00:07:27.300> those<00:07:27.650> mm<00:07:28.760> know<00:07:29.760> that<00:07:30.090> type<00:07:30.330> of

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
have those mm know that type of

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.450 
have those mm know that type of
character<00:07:31.590> there<00:07:31.740> you'll<00:07:31.920> put<00:07:32.310> a<00:07:32.340> little

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
character there you'll put a little

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:39.260 
character there you'll put a little
space<00:07:32.730> in<00:07:32.790> between<00:07:33.060> a<00:07:36.860> little<00:07:37.860> space<00:07:38.070> is<00:07:38.370> good

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270 
space in between a little space is good

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.340 
space in between a little space is good
to<00:07:39.390> do<00:07:39.510> now<00:07:40.050> the<00:07:41.010> next<00:07:41.160> part<00:07:41.310> is<00:07:41.960> really<00:07:42.960> sounds

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.350 
to do now the next part is really sounds

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.430 
to do now the next part is really sounds
cool<00:07:43.560> it<00:07:43.710> sounds<00:07:43.890> like<00:07:44.070> a<00:07:44.130> just<00:07:44.430> a<00:07:45.440> cascading

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 
cool it sounds like a just a cascading

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.210 
cool it sounds like a just a cascading
type<00:07:46.800> of<00:07:47.100> a<00:07:48.260> little<00:07:49.260> run<00:07:49.440> here<00:07:49.470> I'm<00:07:50.100> actually

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220 
type of a little run here I'm actually

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.560 
type of a little run here I'm actually
going<00:07:50.430> to<00:07:50.490> break<00:07:50.700> this<00:07:50.850> into<00:07:51.030> another<00:07:51.210> lesson

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.570 
going to break this into another lesson

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.950 
going to break this into another lesson
so<00:07:51.780> let's<00:07:51.960> stop<00:07:52.200> this<00:07:52.380> lesson<00:07:52.800> and<00:07:52.950> we'll<00:07:53.520> make

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
so let's stop this lesson and we'll make

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.550 
so let's stop this lesson and we'll make
we'll<00:07:54.960> finish<00:07:55.170> this<00:07:55.380> in<00:07:55.530> lesson<00:07:55.860> to<00:07:56.040> the<00:07:56.190> sport
