00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:07.990
 hello today we are going to make some quails 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.990
 in pickle 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.519
 and we started removing the remains of 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.119
 plumage that could have brought the 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.119
 quail 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.390
 if you have thought about passing them to the void 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.180
 I recommend that the sad eyes before 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.210
 prepare them consists of tying the tip of 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.600
 the legs and pass the rope through the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.730
 back 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.180
 and go around the body 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.950
 with these will be much more pieces and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.800
 it will be easier to enter the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.100
 we would remove the string before 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.500
 enter it from the jars logically 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.500
 well then we put salt in the quail 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.309
 and we're going to adore them in a pot with a 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 trickle of extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.260
 we will last them on all sides 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.410
 while browning we will prepare the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.640
 rest of the ingredients 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.120
 we chop an onion 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.120
 ah 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.770
 ah 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.320
 we peel and chop a couple of carrots 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.100
 ah 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 and also three or four cloves of garlic 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.329
 ah 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.050
 when quail browned by 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.050
 all sides are removed from the fire 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.149
 and we reserve them and in the oil where 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.090
 we have browned the quails we add the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.960
 Garlic cloves and one minute has passed 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.409
 approximately the onion we add a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.319
 little salt 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.180
 we give a few laps that will help us 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.250
 drop all those juices that are 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.250
 stuck in the bottom of the pot 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.970
 and we're also going to add about 10-12 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.810
 grains of black pepper and a couple of 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.860
 bay leaves 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.470
 and then the carrot this what 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.860
 let's leave the fire about 10-12 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.860
 minutes 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.959
 After this time we incorporated him 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.959
 the quail 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 and we add water and vinegar in proportion 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.200
 1 to 3 or 3 parts of water and 1 of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.209
 Vinegar until I almost cover them 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.140
 used a vinegar smooth vinegar 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.740
 apple 35 minutes to the fire and they are already 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.590
 lists 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.780
 we let them cool and I recommend you 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.270
 leave them a couple of days in the fridge 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.330
 and this is the result I hope that you 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.330
 like
