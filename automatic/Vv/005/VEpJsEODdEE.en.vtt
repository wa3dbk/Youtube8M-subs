00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 for a boys like always nation that you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.000
 talk is today I wanted to start on this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.550
 second channel that I created does not give 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.590
 very much a new series like opening up 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.619
 to the images is a series on fifa to 13 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.660
 last team I called it the climb 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.210
 as you are seeing now here it is 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 so called because precisely for those who do not 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.730
 he knows is a sort of roth commander 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 on fifa I start with the team of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.040
 bronzoni that you see now I will start with 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 training me all things bra 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.309
 I will think with the first games 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.180
 obviously the first of you from the parts of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 I will only put the highlights back on 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 the goals just 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 there is this first episode I recorded 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.149
 just the game no goal and I put 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.649
 just the goals so as not to bore you too much 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.180
 this weight lasts about seven minutes 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.309
 so I think it's a good start 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 obviously in the other episodes of the non 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.809
 less because they always record three 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.829
 leave but there will not be this piece 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.170
 initial where I showed the first one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.540
 initial package there is a trace per cent 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 let's say right away that I wanted to start 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.330
 this series because I see that many in 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 italy do not treat fearfully known that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.509
 does 13 and do not series to gender for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.280
 to which I tend to compete 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.080
 it's a lot less than the codecs I have 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 wanted to do this i'm doing a 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 second channel because I think it can 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.299
 last really long and I didn't want to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.909
 clog the main channel with fifa 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.229
 because I like to give a lot of variation in the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.820
 channel 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.110
 ok this first opponent didn't have one 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.829
 very strong team was more or less like 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.630
 mine only that I have to tell you is not me 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.960
 I will never strip that results before 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 game 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 I tell you the first game I win 3 a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.329
 2 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.649
 will open hard fought I won 3 to 0 and 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.799
 then the opponent is somehow 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.990
 managed to recover then I wanted 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.640
 tell you right away that I initially have 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.120
 only bought two players you see 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.370
 at the beginning of buying immediately gold because 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.900
 I didn't want players to arrive 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.600
 that is, I didn't want to go away from 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.640
 silver so above all directly 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 starting from the offices this first 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.380
 action destroy the opponent who 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 they lead to nervousness because he did not have 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.470
 wanted to stop the intro is the second 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 I want to do the minute 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.700
 I had to make him an incredible goal 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.250
 very ugly I know it is not true that a 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.170
 but there was no other way for me 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.630
 necks I will do only in exceptional cases 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.330
 still 2 to 0 with moreno which in my opinion is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.500
 really good striker found the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.630
 initial package, however, I do not think 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.460
 these too and I must tell the truth 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.890
 quite slow however in front of the 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.320
 goalkeeper almost never fails here 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.160
 I do contraction enough built 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.500
 in front of the goalkeeper 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.180
 the parade then somehow to the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.920
 back page with a big lo 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
 we will test makes it possible is a blowjob and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.990
 the plaintiff enters and was not the first 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.760
 game that I did with this rose but 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.200
 it was the second and the first time 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.790
 to put why you finish 10 why 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.430
 the opponent has retreated to a den 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.830
 made about 200 pounds and I have them 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.420
 obviously kept these 200 that networks 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.840
 more the bonus than to give it in this one 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 game 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.500
 I will buy the first gold player at a 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.820
 opponent scores with a goal of 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.950
 deviation the usual luck nothing 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.840
 I wanted to say that precisely that from da 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.610
 nabbo where you get to pass you pass 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.709
 the ball only in exceptional cases with 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.860
 maybe I have to catch a game that 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.459
 It is about to end or when when 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.230
 let's do three by two 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.470
 we earn not know how many credits 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.870
 at the extreme 495 credits is with the 200 of 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.140
 first and 400 that now finally there 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.520
 we buy the first gold player i 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.680
 guys don't add yourself on this 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.260
 account because really hallucinating on a 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.030
 plan of requests in this is not it 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.650
 I accept I accept only friends or otherwise 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.840
 people I know on youtube 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.220
 so first I want to understand what I buy 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.500
 will be have you 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.030
 the advice to buy it is true that mine 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.880
 it is a hallucinating way but you find it 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.780
 also for the 4 1 2 1 2 under 700 for 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.060
 tell you I pay 500 and we have the so 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.560
 first player obviously we deploy 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.110
 immediately in pink 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.350
 let's start with 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.360
 second game and second game at 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.100
 I win by 2 to 0 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.190
 we say that the opponent was not gods 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.609
 best I could put it on 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.650
 few occasions that resulted from me 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.030
 good this opponent didn't have one 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.730
 good team we just had to 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.310
 player is now less than the beginning 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.760
 but he played on everything about this 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.740
 player 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.150
 poor for whom you want could not of 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.950
 complete game but you will only see some 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.720
 inspections but I can assure you that 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.680
 all the opponent's actions were up 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.360
 this player 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.419
 we take the ball and pass it on to this 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.220
 here moreno is also infallible 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.780
 on this occasion the second goal 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.500
 I'll score with a striker he didn't have 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.419
 never scored 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.700
 asked the world thanks to the goal and then to 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.460
 to say precisely this picture is his own 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.870
 started only with this one here is therefore a 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.820
 half validity was tired we earn 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.090
 the 300 credit gestures if I have not seen badly 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.280
 and we continue it is certainly seen badly 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.090
 however the second player I buy 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:13.020
 is ederson si ederson and i go to 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.950
 buy for a simple reason why 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.140
 from the other account I had found one 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.910
 package was the result of having 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.790
 last player with a great shot for 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.310
 I'm going to buy it for 400 customers 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.650
 trust players who will buy the first ones 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.030
 I will buy 77 players a little 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.800
 so 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.979
 then as soon as we complete a base rose 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.150
 we will go those strong pieces then later 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.030
 having bought ederson 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.370
 let us proceed by challenging this third party 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.840
 opponent and wait for me a bad one 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.130
 surprise august opponent 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.630
 let's say a good start with two 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.910
 they inhabit a draw because this 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.070
 I will lose but look at the rose of this 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.020
 opponent 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.910
 at fast players like 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.980
 couple sinclair and many others though I have to 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.300
 to say we do not even have certain certainty 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.640
 when you put it it pointed with a couple of me 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.070
 he always jumped but I couldn't do 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.260
 nothing else here an action 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.430
 pretty built with ederson 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.140
 I hit the post where the manager is 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.030
 a great shot for which I will be bought 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.730
 exploited especially in throws and to 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.730
 end to I can mark with and echo later 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.280
 a long action the opponent or draw 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.270
 on a corner kick and I have to be must 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.060
 to tell the truth was very unfortunate 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.700
 with this opponent because all 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.630
 shares mark on the corner was 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.990
 really hallucinating so I am able to 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.760
 new to score with this goal I had 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.930
 afraid of making mistakes in order not to 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.660
 had to make a pass 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.570
 inside, however, I could score very well 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:47.640
 with him is not a goal, and this very much 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.440
 let's proceed then you will see again 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.150
 another corner of the opponent 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.890
 that really marked only on kicks 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.050
 of corners because it had central defenders 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.440
 very tall so I have nothing else left 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.260
 that to greet you I hope you hope it served 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.160
 like the next episode a greeting 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.160
 beautiful
