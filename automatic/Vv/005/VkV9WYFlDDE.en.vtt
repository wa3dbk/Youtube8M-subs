technically end up doing the most with

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
technically end up doing the most with
your<00:00:57.300> knees<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.649> doing<00:00:59.039> other<00:00:59.309> things

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
with the second one so I guess where I'm

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
with the second one so I guess where I'm
going<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.799> start<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.330> a

going to start with is just you want a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
going to start with is just you want a
comfortable<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:07.200> pooping<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.250> knees

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
comfortable with pooping on your knees

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.679 
comfortable with pooping on your knees
and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.060> having<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.510> above<00:01:09.689> your<00:01:09.840> head<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
obviously turning helps slow it down and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
obviously turning helps slow it down and
you<00:01:19.009> know<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.220> not<00:01:20.340> too<00:01:20.580> difficult<00:01:20.729> if

it's not hard to keep it going over your
head<00:01:23.119> where<00:01:24.119> things<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.720> more<00:01:25.020> difficult<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
whatever else so the knees usually I'll

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.660 
whatever else so the knees usually I'll
have<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> pretty<00:02:03.299> fast<00:02:03.509> pace<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
have going at a pretty fast pace and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.399

then the shoulder hooping or chest

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.609 
then the shoulder hooping or chest
tubing<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.369> slow<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.289> i'm<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
tubing is really slow and i'm really

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.370 
tubing is really slow and i'm really
going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> rely<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:12.080> turning

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
going to rely on turning

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.620 
going to rely on turning
to<00:02:13.650> keep<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:18.380> also<00:02:19.380> oh<00:02:20.420> yeah<00:02:21.420> I'm

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to keep it up and also oh yeah I'm

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.090 
to keep it up and also oh yeah I'm
relying<00:02:21.960> on<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:22.980> to

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
relying on that but like you have to

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.240 
relying on that but like you have to
keep<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.490> going<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.650> basically<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:27.270> don't

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
keep it going so basically you don't

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
keep it going so basically you don't
have<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.660> know<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:31.050> have<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
have like you know you have like the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.770 
have like you know you have like the
knees<00:02:31.800> going<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.240> with<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.480> chest

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
knees going and then with your chest

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.140 
knees going and then with your chest
you're<00:02:34.530> not<00:02:34.680> really<00:02:35.220> going<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.000> go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you're not really going to be able to go

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.230 
you're not really going to be able to go
at<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> same<00:02:37.040> quick<00:02:38.040> speed<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.850> can

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
at the same quick speed that you can

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.960 
at the same quick speed that you can
with<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.660> knees<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.310> develop<00:02:41.460> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
with your knees so you have to develop a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:49.220 
with your knees so you have to develop a
new<00:02:42.450> rhythm<00:02:42.800> for<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:47.060> have<00:02:48.230> my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
new rhythm for for that so I have my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.300 
new rhythm for for that so I have my
knees<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.890> like<00:02:51.110> really<00:02:52.110> fast<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:53.160> my

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
knees going like really fast and in my

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.960 
knees going like really fast and in my
chest<00:02:53.640> um<00:02:54.600> no<00:02:55.350> firms<00:02:55.650> leaving<00:02:55.950> right<00:02:56.010> now<00:02:56.130> um

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
chest um no firms leaving right now um

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.960 
chest um no firms leaving right now um
and<00:02:57.630> then<00:02:58.530> my<00:02:58.680> check<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.220> chest<00:02:59.520> might<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.790> more

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
and then my check my chest might be more

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.840 
and then my check my chest might be more
like<00:03:00.890> like<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.160> probably<00:03:02.400> can't<00:03:02.580> hear<00:03:02.700> my

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
like like you probably can't hear my

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.620 
like like you probably can't hear my

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
snap so you bring suits not very well um

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.850 
snap so you bring suits not very well um

and my on my chest I'm turning but you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.970 
and my on my chest I'm turning but you
want<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.600> how<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:14.330> doing<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:16.080> at<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.770> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
want to how to be doing this at like a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.380 
want to how to be doing this at like a
slower<00:03:17.790> pace<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> same<00:03:21.270> with

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
slower pace so and it's the same with

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.960 
slower pace so and it's the same with
your<00:03:21.570> waist<00:03:22.200> too<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.910> be

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
your waist too because you have to be

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.940 
your waist too because you have to be
able<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.210> keep<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.510> around<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:25.230> also<00:03:25.470> be

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
able to keep it around but also be

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.600 
able to keep it around but also be
working<00:03:26.910> your<00:03:27.300> legs<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:29.160> way<00:03:29.400> that

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
working your legs so and the way that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.020 
working your legs so and the way that
you<00:03:29.730> move<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.210> hips<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.780> your<00:03:30.900> waist<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:32.030> do

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you move your hips and your waist to do

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.380 
you move your hips and your waist to do
that<00:03:33.300> is<00:03:33.600> very<00:03:34.110> different<00:03:34.410> from<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:36.000> movement

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
that is very different from the movement

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.600 
that is very different from the movement
they<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.870> make<00:03:37.020> with<00:03:37.290> your<00:03:37.500> like<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.340> if

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
they have to make with your like so if

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.480 
they have to make with your like so if
you<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.330> get<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.900> where<00:03:40.460> you're<00:03:41.460> very

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
you can get it to where you're very

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.420 
you can get it to where you're very
comfortable<00:03:42.000> moving<00:03:42.480> your<00:03:42.840> hips<00:03:43.050> as<00:03:43.500> your

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
comfortable moving your hips as your

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.670 
comfortable moving your hips as your
knee<00:03:44.640> who<00:03:44.850> think<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.330> can<00:03:45.690> help<00:03:45.870> do<00:03:46.470> you<00:03:46.560> see

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
knee who think that can help do you see

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.610 
knee who think that can help do you see
house<00:03:46.860> much<00:03:47.250> slower<00:03:47.580> my<00:03:48.540> upper<00:03:48.900> hoop<00:03:49.080> is<00:03:49.260> going

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
house much slower my upper hoop is going

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.920 
house much slower my upper hoop is going
from<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> other<00:03:50.340> one<00:03:50.459> because<00:03:50.580> rely<00:03:51.060> mostly

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
from the other one because rely mostly

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.530 
from the other one because rely mostly
on<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:55.430> woman's<00:03:56.430> own<00:03:56.580> from<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.880> turns<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.450> a

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
on the woman's own from the turns and a

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.810 
on the woman's own from the turns and a
little<00:03:57.840> bit<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.190> waste<00:03:59.190> mood<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.610> can

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
little bit of waste mood and that can

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.030 
little bit of waste mood and that can
give<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.330> let's<00:04:01.110> bring<00:04:01.320> up<00:04:01.380> her<00:04:01.560> shoulders

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
give it so let's bring up her shoulders

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.750 
give it so let's bring up her shoulders
and<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:04.890> relax<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.400> little<00:04:05.550> bit

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and you see I can relax a little bit

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.320 
and you see I can relax a little bit
there<00:04:05.970> because<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.300> better<00:04:06.570> this<00:04:07.490> but<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.790> tend

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
there because of better this but I tend

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.990 
there because of better this but I tend
to<00:04:09.450> treat<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> knee<00:04:09.990> whooping<00:04:10.380> kind<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.680> like

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
to treat the knee whooping kind of like

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.320 
to treat the knee whooping kind of like
little<00:04:12.000> steps<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.010> then<00:04:14.010> you'll<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.150> my

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
little steps and then you'll see my

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.870 
little steps and then you'll see my
upper<00:04:15.720> half<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.080> kind<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.380> moving<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.950> lot<00:04:17.580> and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
upper half is kind of moving a lot and

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.840 
upper half is kind of moving a lot and
it's<00:04:18.270> going<00:04:18.390> much<00:04:18.690> slower<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:20.250> until<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.670> can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
it's going much slower so until you can

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.430 
it's going much slower so until you can
get<00:04:21.770> obviously<00:04:22.770> really<00:04:22.919> good<00:04:23.190> which<00:04:23.400> I'm<00:04:24.440> not

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
get obviously really good which I'm not

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.930 
get obviously really good which I'm not
amazing<00:04:25.890> yeah<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.220> can't<00:04:26.550> even<00:04:26.729> do

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
amazing yeah I can't even do

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:35.360 
amazing yeah I can't even do
like<00:04:27.180> more<00:04:27.450> than<00:04:27.480> three<00:04:28.200> but<00:04:30.890> you<00:04:31.890> know<00:04:34.370> you

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
like more than three but you know you

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.340 
like more than three but you know you
kind<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.670> have<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.910> end<00:04:36.180> up<00:04:36.270> adding<00:04:36.750> these

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
kind of have to end up adding these

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.550 
kind of have to end up adding these
rhythms<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:38.040> where<00:04:38.250> your<00:04:38.580> body<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.260> moving<00:04:40.260> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
rhythms to where your body is moving a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.110 
rhythms to where your body is moving a
lot<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.770> different<00:04:41.190> ways<00:04:41.220> at<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.520> same<00:04:41.850> time

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
lot of different ways at the same time

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.380 
lot of different ways at the same time
