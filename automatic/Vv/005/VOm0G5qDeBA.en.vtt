00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.100
 I recently found an article in a 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.210
 scientific eye that caught my attention 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.980
 especially for those who have 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.820
 smartphone and tablets and worry 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.230
 much for the aesthetics of these devices 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.210
 we know that sometimes a smartphone or 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
 a tablet represents a lot to 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.960
 us even when we have it that 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
 sell the first thing they ask us is 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.660
 if one has the screen scratched on this 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.440
 occasion we will analyze this type of cases 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.079
 but how to eliminate scratches from 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.440
 smartphones and tablets according to 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.630
 source of there are several options just 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.420
 we will mention three of them that to me 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.160
 they seemed the best first are the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.920
 creams to eliminate scratches 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.960
 automobiles is one of the options and 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.330
 we know that in the market there is a 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.710
 great variety of creams that are dedicated to 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.840
 finish with the scratches on the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 vehicles so if you have one of these 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.660
 in your house 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.170
 it only takes a small amount and in a 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.630
 microfiber cloth you must move it in 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.940
 circles on the rayon that should 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.260
 show good results you should not use 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.180
 no corrosive agent 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.890
 or too strong because it would damage the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.670
 screen from which I get more 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.860
 easy 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.080
 this is even simpler in fact you can 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.970
 have the things in your house in the pasta 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.790
 of teeth and a small cloth 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.650
 microfiber or a cotonete or stick of 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.350
 cotton which are the ones used to 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.300
 clean the ears should the process is 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.520
 very similar to the previous one you just have to 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.490
 place a small amount of pasta in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.050
 the cloth and also pass it gently and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.390
 with circular movements on the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.970
 rayon when you finish you should clean the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.330
 toothpaste with a cloth lightly 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 wet this should show good 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.990
 results but you should not use pasta 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.210
 of gel teeth but the one that is 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.400
 cream such as the pendant 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.910
 there's another one called bicarbonate 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.760
 sodium soda or baby powder you must mix 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.620
 two parts of baking soda and one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.380
 of water in a container until it 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.760
 make a small paste like this pasta 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.550
 you should apply it on rayon 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 using a soft handkerchief and performing 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.870
 circular movements when you finish 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.910
 you also obviously have to remove with 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.240
 a cloth lightly wet all the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.210
 excess that can be replaced 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.970
 Baking soda with baby powder and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.000
 proceed with the same amount and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 method of application and cleaning the 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.950
 what made me weird is vegetable oil 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.989
 the source mentioned that it is for scratches 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.849
 very small you should apply a small 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.550
 amount of vegetable oil in a cloth 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.220
 soft and pass it on rayon and dogs 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.500
 very small scratches like this will be removed 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.410
 the damages of the cosmetic type 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 well that's what I wanted to leave you in 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.690
 this time farewell Lord Fox
