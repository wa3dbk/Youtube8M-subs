00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.630
 Welcome dear and esteemed students below let's see 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 the subject of environmental communication 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.289
 environmental communication is one of the strategies 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.969
 that will serve them a lot to be able to work what is environmental education 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.839
 Through communication we can create strategies 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.899
 and locate the appropriate methods that help us reach a specific audience 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.720
 and with this to be able to create 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.680
 an environmental awareness that is what we want to pursue with the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.960
 environmental education as we've seen it so far 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 In 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.980
 this matter 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.940
 I have put a very important methodology 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 which is called 4P 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.640
 it is a tool 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.270
 that will help them plan what communication products could be 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.070
 the most suitable to reach our general objective 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.320
 This 4P methodology is a methodology that comes from an initiative 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.910
 from a foreign institution; 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.070
 that help, 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 that the citizens of a certain place get involved in a whole process 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 to be able to prepare a communicational program 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.100
 Y 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.359
 with this we achieve that through their reality 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.490
 support with ideas, suggestions, so we can build 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 the most appropriate communication tools 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 The methodology 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.510
 4P 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 It comes or 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.950
 It has that name because it reveals four important steps 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.120
 inside this tool 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.700
 the first one that is problem 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.220
 the second one that is the public 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 the third that is the product and the fourth that is the plan 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.720
 what does this mean 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.480
 we 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.670
 through the first pattern that is the problem 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280
 we can attack 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.090
 some specific problem 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.869
 what is he going through 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.460
 that community or that specific place 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.989
 that is to say with this methodology we can attack punctually 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.829
 to a conflict 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.939
 environmental or ecological that is living at this time some 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.399
 population in particular 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.889
 as you can see is the fundamental part of the whole program 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.299
 We have to 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.479
 prioritize 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:30.039
 what problem can we attack and is it feasible to attack 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.209
 let's not forget 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.760
 that we can not get involved or suggest or try to solve problems 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.460
 that are not within our reach 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.009
 will arise when we want to work this methodology many 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.579
 people who always involve political problems 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.859
 that gives us our reach therefore we have to discard it and try 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.510
 to locate feasible problems to be able to attack 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.219
 and that are within our reach 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.249
 As you can see, I gave you an example if we spoke in some community 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.069
 punctual about a problem that is generating garbage we can 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.879
 try to locate communicational products that help attack 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.559
 this problem and give solution 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.559
 the second point is the public 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.209
 us then 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.709
 to identify the problem we have to see to which public we are going to 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:21.539
 lead 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.899
 and we have to select which public is going to be involved in this problem 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.299
 to attack 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.409
 therefore through this public we can look for the means 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.479
 idoneos that will help us 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.219
 locate the tools 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.990
 for example if we are talking 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.739
 from the previous example and we talked about the separation of garbage 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.789
 we can go through 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.159
 of the involvement of all people 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.059
 direct us and we can know that under this problem they are involved 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.139
 both children, young people, adults a whole population in general 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.180
 The third step is the product 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:03.029
 the product as you see it there are tools or events that we 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:03.809
 help 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.529
 to give a message to a certain group 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.089
 therefore the products usually go hand in hand with campaigns of 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.159
 diffusion and 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.449
 campaigns with education 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.799
 and then therefore that we can realize 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.120
 what social communication is directly related or goes hand in hand 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.440
 with what is environmental education 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.499
 An example 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.829
 we keep thinking about the previous examples if we talk about the problem of 

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:32.409
 the garbage and we see that the public is addressed to all then 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.840
 we have tried 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.680
 identify the most appropriate means to attack this problem then 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.889
 We have definitely seen that wedges, fences and educational material is what 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.690
 fundamental that this punctual community needs 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.090
 so they can know the problem of garbage separation 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.180
 Finally we have what is the plan 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.930
 the plan is 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.800
 the space where we plan 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.249
 the products that we are going to execute 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.220
 a plan 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.969
 has three instances short, medium and long term as they can be seen there 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.360
 we always have to locate 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.360
 what communication products can be worked on at this time 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 what medium-term products and what long-term products 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.410
 who put the times that is short medium and long term we are 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.430
 ourselves who are 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.670
 drawing up a plan 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.849
 then we say 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.770
 a short-term plan will be: one to three months; 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.699
 medium term: four to six months; long-term: after one year and in 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.970
 base to that we can plan very well 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.639
 the communication strategies that will arrive 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.719
 to all this audience that we want to attack or want to give solution 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:43.759
 to the problem 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:46.289
 Thank you
