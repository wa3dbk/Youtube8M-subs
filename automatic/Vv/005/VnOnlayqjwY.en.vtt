00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.319
 here today at fepasa we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.250
 How did this change work? 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.070
 to fit a leading car in this market. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.580
 segment even make a new car a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 new queue really all that same 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 It smells good personal day really 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.560
 fiorino when she already had her change 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.029
 This is complicated to say because in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 team that is winning us change 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 always risky is that fiorino she 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.809
 has been on the market for almost 27 years and 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 has always remained for more than a decade 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.610
 market leader 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.040
 understanding the public very well is this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.820
 total change I will not say radical anymore 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.780
 this total she tim that I came to that for 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.789
 really surprise those who were already 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 loyal users of our fiorino nÃ© 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.020
 and she came really pleasing and 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.910
 pleasing too much has overcome all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 expectations comfort performance consumption 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.739
 silence cargo capacity per year 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 the way that fiat managed to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.380
 change it both in the distance between 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.909
 a new design of it the comfort of the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 car surprised in every way 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.820
 no this is a utility car in the then 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.640
 union the cost-benefit work at last 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 to ride like it got suspended 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.720
 her rohde 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.970
 then it's like a car loading a car 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.090
 utility the most important part of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.680
 utility car is the suspension and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.740
 especially the rear suspension that 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.659
 is where it is most demanded, then 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.420
 the fia she works with that system 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.470
 rear suspension system with a 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 spring beam 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.970
 what is this, this is a blade and this 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.470
 spring blade instead of having a spring 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 helical on front to rear 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.670
 has a ball blade because it uses 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.049
 this makes it capable of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 very good load 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.390
 This car accepts more of fear and nothing. 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.000
 650 kg of cargo capacity and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 in kilos and volumetric of three thousand and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.110
 one hundred liters 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.500
 then this safety spring bundle in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.929
 curves and stability and with 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.020
 because it is used by various types 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.870
 of companies since pet shopping 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.750
 laundry is the one who has a mini market 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.190
 who needs a nimble car a car 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.920
 you'll have to do it like this 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.870
 direct work from door to door that 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.450
 will have to wear a lot of back 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.920
 This is the part that was most thought of in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.990
 new hill 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.630
 things have changed quite a lot system 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.820
 Side opening the door coupler 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.700
 load capacity system 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.310
 of the cabin that before we had not been there 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.980
 the whole back was all 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.290
 now coated with a finish 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.520
 prevent it from occurring when the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.310
 people are going to put something inside 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.440
 beat and then the march from inside to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.840
 out it was a this is a thing that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.489
 enough happened then for everything and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.770
 any kind of person who comes to 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.500
 use this car he caters for all 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.260
 the public and the price of how 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.880
 then this is something to be 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.200
 market leader with abusive price 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.400
 nobody can not 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.290
 The interesting thing is that we managed to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.250
 keep a very humorous price range 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.530
 sputum 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.200
 today we have more than fifteen violins 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.690
 the prompt delivery by the delivery system 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120
 natural person or legal entity and 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.489
 We already have her ready. 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.470
 delivery in the store from 39 thousand and 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.540
 two hundred reais 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.400
 it's very worth it it 's worth coming here 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.860
 because the car automatically it runs out 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.060
 if paying is not a car that who buys 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.590
 Do not want to leave in the garage. 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.660
 we have a client who 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.610
 bought a car and that car did not 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.010
 stops all day long with 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.570
 off because it really is like me 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.739
 I mentioned that there are several companies 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.840
 we have companies that work in the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.579
 airport where you travel out of the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.620
 Been delivering things or in the interior 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.170
 state in the western part of the state that is 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.670
 far and this car goes straight goes around 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.660
 every day without stopping 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.430
 we have to take into account 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.650
 that everyone looking for a car 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.049
 utility a car has to leave 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.030
 as that is the main advantage she 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.650
 not only talking about economy of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.700
 but as the economy of 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.970
 maintenance 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.280
 Fiorino, she was always very welcome. 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.140
 very well looked after by the owners and 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.700
 by users and asking for trust 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.200
 engine suspension system and exchange 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.750
 because the great mother who will get a 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.280
 fiorino of this with 11 years of use them 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.230
 they usually run well over 100 thousand 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.150
 miles to a car that will do 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.620
 This has to have a lot of respect. 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.350
 then the main advantage of the economy 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.450
 fuel economy and the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.490
 maintenance is what attracts many 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.500
 buyers still to fiorino then 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.810
 come to understand this one in this house and the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.250
 call who is not faithful not 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.630
 chose the car as a non- utility 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.880
 You know you 're learning, right? 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.280
 so it's really worth living because 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660
 she has a range of accessories now 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 very advantageous 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.310
 We heard it came from there. 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.620

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.750
 his private car and has fiorino the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.190
 What happens is that today, walking with

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.990
 load capacity 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.419
 many times when speaking bsb of in

 Brake correction according to volume 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.130
 of load 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.479
 this is a large gap has to 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.580
 take into account
