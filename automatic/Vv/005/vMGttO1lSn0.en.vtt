00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
right since we have the sit-out is a

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.830 
right since we have the sit-out is a
good<00:00:08.700> time<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.150> show<00:00:09.889> you<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.850> components

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
good time to show you all the components

good time to show you all the components
in<00:00:13.350> the<00:00:14.010> engine<00:00:14.129> bay<00:00:14.699> of<00:00:15.209> this<00:00:15.600> sym<00:00:16.730> i<00:00:17.730> try<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
in the engine bay of this sym i try to

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.169 
in the engine bay of this sym i try to
point<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.589> few<00:00:19.679> of<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.220> items<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.150> is

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
point out a few of those items which is

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.990 
point out a few of those items which is
quite<00:00:21.720> important<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.349> we<00:00:23.339> may<00:00:23.609> need<00:00:23.669> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
quite important that we may need to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.870 
quite important that we may need to
service<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.499> carburetor<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:31.880> close

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
service this is the carburetor and close

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.369 
service this is the carburetor and close
by<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.840> throttle<00:00:34.470> cable<00:00:36.050> rest<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
by will be the throttle cable rest of

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.569 
by will be the throttle cable rest of
the<00:00:37.500> cable<00:00:38.239> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.480> screw<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.770> net<00:00:40.980> this

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the cable this is a screw to net this

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.029 
the cable this is a screw to net this
use<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.329> adjust<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.960> slackness<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
use to adjust the slackness in the

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.189 
use to adjust the slackness in the
throttle<00:00:44.489> cable<00:00:44.670> give<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> speed<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
throttle cable give you a speed in a

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.290 
throttle cable give you a speed in a
slightly<00:00:46.890> shorter<00:00:47.039> cable<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.850> adjust

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
slightly shorter cable you can adjust

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
slightly shorter cable you can adjust
this<00:00:49.609> in<00:00:50.609> from<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.769> idle<00:00:52.769> speed<00:00:53.100> adjustment

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this in from this idle speed adjustment

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.520 
this in from this idle speed adjustment
screw<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:55.730> that's<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.390> user<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.199> do

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
screw and that's about it for user to do

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.119 
screw and that's about it for user to do
a<00:00:58.559> justman<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.429> carburetor<00:01:00.589> mostly<00:01:01.589> we<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.949> the

a justman on carburetor mostly we do the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
a justman on carburetor mostly we do the
adjustment<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.730> idle<00:01:03.359> speed<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.410> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
adjustment on idle speed there is a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.540 
adjustment on idle speed there is a
mixture<00:01:05.010> screw<00:01:06.110> or<00:01:07.110> adjusting<00:01:07.920> fuel<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
mixture screw or adjusting fuel a

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.690 
mixture screw or adjusting fuel a
mixture<00:01:09.150> however<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.380> quite<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.190> elaborate

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
mixture however is quite an elaborate

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.520 
mixture however is quite an elaborate
process<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.050> internet<00:01:13.500> adjustment

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
process that kind of internet adjustment

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.640 
process that kind of internet adjustment
beside<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.680> coverage<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.230> CDI<00:01:19.230> or

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
beside the coverage this is the CDI or

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.540 
beside the coverage this is the CDI or
coil<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:21.230> the<00:01:22.230> coil<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.800> having<00:01:23.370> two

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
connector and then high tension will go

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.350 
connector and then high tension will go

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
engine is a spark line and you just say

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.280 
engine is a spark line and you just say
this<00:01:34.370> there's<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.550> spot<00:01:35.850> lock<00:01:36.120> you<00:01:36.960> only<00:01:37.110> see

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this there's the spot lock you only see

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.010 
this there's the spot lock you only see
the<00:01:37.410> connect<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.950> connector<00:01:38.840> spark<00:01:39.840> plug<00:01:39.990> is
