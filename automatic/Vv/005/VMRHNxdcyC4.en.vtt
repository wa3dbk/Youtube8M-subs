00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it's got a brightness adjust back here

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.929 
it's got a brightness adjust back here
so<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.380> from<00:01:49.590> bright<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.070> dim<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
so you can go from bright to dim kind of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.410 
so you can go from bright to dim kind of
an<00:01:51.030> infinite<00:01:51.390> adjust<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:53.159> also<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
an infinite adjust and then also on the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
an infinite adjust and then also on the
front<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.280> adjust<00:01:56.280> four<00:01:56.520> spot<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
front it has a adjust four spot and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
front it has a adjust four spot and
flood<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.799> tell<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> thing

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
flood and I got to tell you this thing

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.050 
flood and I got to tell you this thing
puts<00:01:59.850> out<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> believe<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.659> 155<00:02:01.439> lumens<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.820> at

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
puts out I believe it 155 lumens and at

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.590 
puts out I believe it 155 lumens and at
the<00:02:03.180> brightest<00:02:03.570> setting<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.600> spot

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the brightest setting with the spot

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
the brightest setting with the spot
setting<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.380> reaches<00:02:07.979> out<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> know

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
setting it reaches out there you know

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.089 
setting it reaches out there you know
probably<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.660> know<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.989> think<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.500> claim<00:02:10.800> you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
probably you know I think they claim you

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.590 
probably you know I think they claim you
know<00:02:11.190> 180<00:02:11.700> meters<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.300> believe<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.050> got

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
know 180 meters I believe but I got

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.330 
know 180 meters I believe but I got
tell<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.170> know<00:02:14.260> it's<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.100> like<00:02:15.220> a

tell you you know it's just like a
spotlight<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.880> could<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.530> drive<00:02:17.530> with

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
spotlight you could actually drive with

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.040 
spotlight you could actually drive with
this<00:02:18.040> thing<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.820> in<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> boat<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.600> use

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
this thing you know in the boat and use

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.200 
this thing you know in the boat and use
it<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.230> navigation<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.130> pinch<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.880> really

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
it for navigation in a pinch it's really

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.920 
it for navigation in a pinch it's really
that<00:02:22.420> bright

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that bright

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.680 
that bright
in<00:02:23.590> fact<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.790> can't<00:02:25.030> really<00:02:25.300> use<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.600> at

the brightness setting in the boat you

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.860 
the brightness setting in the boat you
know<00:02:27.610> close<00:02:27.880> up<00:02:28.120> because<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.420> blind

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
have read a few comments about the wire

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.850 
have read a few comments about the wire
becoming<00:03:12.520> loose<00:03:12.820> there<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:14.260> fact<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.650> had

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
the way down to the lowest setting then

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.450 
the way down to the lowest setting then
if<00:04:53.450> it<00:04:53.570> does<00:04:53.750> turn<00:04:54.020> on<00:04:54.080> your<00:04:54.950> batteries<00:04:55.340> won't

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
if it does turn on your batteries won't

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.600 
if it does turn on your batteries won't
go<00:04:55.700> dead<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.170> know<00:04:57.200> real<00:04:57.530> quick<00:04:57.680> because<00:04:58.160> at

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
go dead you know real quick because at

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.280 
go dead you know real quick because at
the<00:04:58.760> highest<00:04:58.970> setting<00:04:59.270> these<00:04:59.690> batteries<00:05:00.140> will

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
the highest setting these batteries will

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.620 
the highest setting these batteries will
last<00:05:00.320> about<00:05:00.590> five<00:05:00.920> hours<00:05:01.240> at<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.360> lowest

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
last about five hours at the lowest

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.150 
last about five hours at the lowest
setting<00:05:02.780> it's<00:05:03.050> about<00:05:03.200> sixty<00:05:03.590> hours<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:03.980> it<00:05:04.070> is

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
setting it's about sixty hours so it is

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.980 
setting it's about sixty hours so it is
a<00:05:04.190> pretty<00:05:04.340> big<00:05:04.550> difference<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.630> believe

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
a pretty big difference and I believe

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.650 
a pretty big difference and I believe
that<00:05:06.020> lumen<00:05:06.650> goes<00:05:06.920> from<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.850> think<00:05:08.360> it's<00:05:08.480> two

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
that lumen goes from I think it's two

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.650 
that lumen goes from I think it's two
lumens<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.380> 150<00:05:10.370> 5<00:05:10.520> lumens<00:05:10.790> depending<00:05:11.390> on<00:05:11.510> your

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
lumens to 150 5 lumens depending on your

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.520 
lumens to 150 5 lumens depending on your
adjustment<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:13.280> yeah<00:05:13.540> LED<00:05:14.540> lenser<00:05:14.900> I'll<00:05:15.230> put<00:05:15.500> a

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
adjustment so yeah LED lenser I'll put a

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.490 
adjustment so yeah LED lenser I'll put a
link<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.180> description<00:05:17.690> where<00:05:18.440> you
