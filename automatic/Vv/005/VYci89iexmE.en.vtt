00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you want it to be so the core idea of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.920 
you want it to be so the core idea of
the<00:00:32.700> mode<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.000> still<00:00:33.149> gonna<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> same<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the mode is still gonna be the same so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.209 
the mode is still gonna be the same so
you<00:00:33.960> can't<00:00:34.230> change<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.040> change

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you can't change that but you can change

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.479 
you can't change that but you can change
up<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.579> 200<00:00:36.480> parameters<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.950> say<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
up to 200 parameters so if you say I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.510 
up to 200 parameters so if you say I
only<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.540> them<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> gun<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.250> all

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
only want them to use the gun then all

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.220

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of them can only use the gun you can

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
of them can only use the gun you can
force<00:00:43.469> abilities<00:00:44.010> upon<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> players<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.850> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
force abilities upon the players you can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.090 
force abilities upon the players you can
also<00:00:45.149> change<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> scoring<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> say

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
also change the scoring so if you say

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.549 
also change the scoring so if you say
I'm<00:00:47.640> terrible<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.450> numbers<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.320> can't

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I'm terrible with numbers like I can't

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
I'm terrible with numbers like I can't
actually<00:00:49.770> count<00:00:50.160> properly<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
actually count properly so I want to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.760 
actually count properly so I want to
keep<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.870> numbers<00:00:52.170> low<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> can

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
keep the numbers low so you can

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
keep the numbers low so you can
basically<00:00:52.920> say<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> every<00:00:53.850> action<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
basically say that every action in the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.090 
basically say that every action in the
game<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:54.750> grant<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.230> point<00:00:55.469> down<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
game will grant them one point down a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.410 
game will grant them one point down a
reaction<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> game<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.910> Grant<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.300> one

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
reaction the game with Grant in one

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
reaction the game with Grant in one
point<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.770> change<00:00:59.010> up

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
point so you can see you can change up

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
point so you can see you can change up
so<00:00:59.520> many<00:00:59.640> things<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> game<00:01:00.600> lab<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.020> to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
effectively you have to lock your target

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.030 
effectively you have to lock your target
first<00:02:50.640> because<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> can't<00:02:51.510> just<00:02:51.720> throw<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> gun

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
first because you can't just throw a gun

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.070 
first because you can't just throw a gun
and<00:02:53.310> then<00:02:53.790> shoot<00:02:54.090> anywhere<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.870> need<00:02:54.990> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
and then shoot anywhere you need to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.690 
and then shoot anywhere you need to
focus<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.470> little<00:02:55.560> bit<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.220> what<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
focus a little bit so that's what the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.830 
focus a little bit so that's what the
lock<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> for<00:02:57.209> if<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.540> lock<00:02:57.720> your

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
lock is for if you don't lock your

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.510 
lock is for if you don't lock your
target<00:02:58.170> beforehand<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:59.070> likely<00:02:59.370> that

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
target beforehand it's likely that

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.220 
target beforehand it's likely that
you're<00:02:59.760> gonna<00:02:59.850> miss<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.240> shot<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.900> make<00:03:01.200> sure

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
you're gonna miss your shot so make sure

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.320 
you're gonna miss your shot so make sure
to<00:03:01.410> lock<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.830> beforehand<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.880> only<00:03:03.090> thing

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the hell out of there so he really

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.310 
the hell out of there so he really
really<00:03:29.730> tries<00:03:30.030> not<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.450> stay<00:03:30.660> where<00:03:30.870> he<00:03:30.900> was

this blue lock which means that was his
target<00:03:33.600> however<00:03:34.140> his<00:03:34.350> target<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.769> faster

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
target however his target was faster

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.070 
target however his target was faster
about<00:03:35.640> it<00:03:35.850> before<00:03:36.450> he<00:03:36.540> could<00:03:36.660> actually<00:03:36.780> draw

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
about it before he could actually draw

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.140 
about it before he could actually draw
his<00:03:37.650> gun<00:03:37.739> his<00:03:38.190> target<00:03:38.610> came<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.000> him<00:03:39.060> and

slapped him in the face which is

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.100 
slapped him in the face which is
basically<00:03:40.769> a<00:03:40.860> stunt<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.489> math<00:03:42.330> that's<00:03:42.360> done

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
basically a stunt I math that's done

the<00:04:22.199> approach<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.770> should<00:04:22.800> go<00:04:23.100> for<00:04:23.400> we<00:04:24.060> just

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
the approach you should go for we just

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.360 
the approach you should go for we just
saw<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.810> idea<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.320> actually<00:04:25.860> does<00:04:26.130> a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
saw that the idea that actually does a

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.550 
saw that the idea that actually does a
lot<00:04:26.610> of<00:04:26.669> points<00:04:27.120> we<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:27.240> 350<00:04:28.110> points<00:04:28.260> for

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
lot of points we have 350 points for

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.050 
lot of points we have 350 points for
someone<00:04:28.889> stunning<00:04:29.250> someone<00:04:29.520> else<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.970> which

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
someone stunning someone else and which

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.820 
someone stunning someone else and which
is<00:04:30.240> quite<00:04:30.900> an<00:04:31.050> achievement<00:04:31.169> because<00:04:31.530> it's

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
is quite an achievement because it's

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.140 
is quite an achievement because it's
hard<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.400> really<00:04:32.639> have<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.880> be<00:04:32.940> quick

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
hard to do you really have to be quick

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.540 
hard to do you really have to be quick
about<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.419> if<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.979> normally<00:04:35.130> shoot

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
about it if you just normally shoot

it<00:04:58.919> then<00:04:59.550> it<00:04:59.669> can<00:04:59.789> just<00:04:59.820> casually<00:05:00.600> woke<00:05:00.780> up<00:05:00.960> to

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
it then it can just casually woke up to

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.930 
it then it can just casually woke up to
the<00:05:01.200> death<00:05:01.380> curves<00:05:01.919> on<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.130> flooring<00:05:02.520> kick

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
the death curves on the flooring kick

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.659 
the death curves on the flooring kick
it's<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:03.600> that's<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.380> want<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.280> get

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
it's because that's you want and you get

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.040 
it's because that's you want and you get
a<00:05:05.699> harder<00:05:06.000> than<00:05:06.120> 50<00:05:06.389> points<00:05:06.630> for<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:06.840> so

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
a harder than 50 points for that so

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.100 
a harder than 50 points for that so
that's<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.440> pretty<00:05:07.889> neat<00:05:08.160> too<00:05:08.660> once<00:05:09.660> more<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> get

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
that's a pretty neat too once more I get

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.450 
that's a pretty neat too once more I get
