00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
League of Legends but you can't do any

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.730 
League of Legends but you can't do any
damage<00:01:48.570> while<00:01:48.899> they're<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.590> it's

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
damage while they're in there so it's

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.160 
damage while they're in there so it's
kind<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.009> useless<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.390> knock-back<00:01:51.600> kind<00:01:52.079> of

is that it has a two-second swing on its
auto<00:03:42.910> attack<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:43.900> not<00:03:44.019> two<00:03:44.170> seconds<00:03:44.500> it's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
