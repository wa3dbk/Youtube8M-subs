gonna plot seven under a redstone and

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.970 
gonna plot seven under a redstone and
commands<00:00:28.840> boom

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
commands boom

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.729 
commands boom

no I'm gonna fly over here and we
basically<00:00:32.890> have<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.129> little<00:00:33.309> setup<00:00:33.489> here

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
basically have a little setup here

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.369 
basically have a little setup here
there's<00:00:33.910> two<00:00:34.150> clocks<00:00:34.420> running<00:00:34.750> for<00:00:35.199> six

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
there's two clocks running for six

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.430 
there's two clocks running for six
commands<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.910> just<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.269> set<00:00:37.480> block<00:00:37.660> command

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
commands it's just a set block command

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.930 
commands it's just a set block command
that's<00:00:38.830> basically<00:00:39.280> summoning<00:00:39.790> and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
that's basically summoning and

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.600 
that's basically summoning and
destroying<00:00:40.300> or<00:00:40.629> setting<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.050> destroying<00:00:41.379> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
destroying or setting and destroying a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.069 
destroying or setting and destroying a
redstone<00:00:42.610> block<00:00:42.730> activating<00:00:43.600> itself<00:00:43.900> so

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
redstone block activating itself so

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.270 
redstone block activating itself so
we're<00:00:44.199> gonna<00:00:44.290> start<00:00:44.620> these<00:00:44.769> up<00:00:44.949> real<00:00:45.129> quick

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
we're gonna start these up real quick

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.759 
we're gonna start these up real quick
and<00:00:48.479> then<00:00:49.479> the<00:00:49.780> same<00:00:50.019> for<00:00:50.229> this<00:00:50.350> one<00:00:50.559> just

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
and then the same for this one just

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.770 
and then the same for this one just
delete<00:00:51.250> that<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:53.339> now<00:00:54.339> as<00:00:55.330> we<00:00:55.479> follow<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
delete that you and now as we follow the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.719 
delete that you and now as we follow the
ground<00:00:55.989> we<00:00:56.170> walk<00:00:56.290> around<00:00:56.470> it<00:00:57.280> seems<00:00:57.489> pretty

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
ground we walk around it seems pretty

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.640 
ground we walk around it seems pretty
normal<00:00:57.970> but<00:00:58.180> if<00:00:58.360> we<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.510> into<00:00:58.629> f5<00:00:58.930> mode<00:00:59.140> you're

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
normal but if we go into f5 mode you're

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.899 
normal but if we go into f5 mode you're
a<00:00:59.680> mushroom<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.129> that's<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.820> whole

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
a mushroom so that's it that's the whole

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.080 
a mushroom so that's it that's the whole
thing<00:01:04.119> I<00:01:05.369> pretty<00:01:06.369> much<00:01:06.460> wanted<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.820> make<00:01:06.939> this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
thing I pretty much wanted to make this

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.429 
thing I pretty much wanted to make this
ever<00:01:07.299> since<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:07.689> made<00:01:07.840> mushroom<00:01:08.229> Steve

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
ever since I made mushroom Steve

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.469 
ever since I made mushroom Steve
somebody<00:01:09.310> suggested<00:01:09.909> that<00:01:10.119> somebody<00:01:10.420> should

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
somebody suggested that somebody should

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.210 
somebody suggested that somebody should
make<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.659> mod<00:01:10.930> allows<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:11.920> to<00:01:11.979> play<00:01:12.130> as

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
make a mod allows you to play as

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.859 
make a mod allows you to play as
mushroom<00:01:12.520> Steve<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.420> just<00:01:13.600> gave<00:01:13.689> me

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
mushroom Steve and that just gave me

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.200 
mushroom Steve and that just gave me
this<00:01:13.990> idea<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:14.979> I'm<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.430> excited<00:01:15.759> about<00:01:15.880> this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
this idea so I'm so excited about this

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.640 
this idea so I'm so excited about this
little<00:01:16.540> particle<00:01:16.960> is<00:01:17.020> even<00:01:17.229> coming<00:01:17.320> out<00:01:17.470> when

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
little particle is even coming out when

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.610 
little particle is even coming out when
you<00:01:17.710> land<00:01:17.920> that's<00:01:18.730> beautiful

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
you land that's beautiful

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.870 
you land that's beautiful
now<00:01:20.620> there<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.190> couple<00:01:21.310> flaws<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
now there are a couple flaws in the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.910 
now there are a couple flaws in the
system<00:01:22.180> one<00:01:22.540> is<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.960> very<00:01:23.080> noticeable<00:01:23.590> it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
system one is the very noticeable it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.230 
system one is the very noticeable it
only<00:01:25.350> sets<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.500> mushroom<00:01:26.980> in<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:27.940> center<00:01:28.210> of

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
only sets the mushroom in the center of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.550 
only sets the mushroom in the center of
the<00:01:28.330> block<00:01:28.510> so<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.960> kind<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.200> has<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.350> little

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
the block so it kind of has that little

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.550 
the block so it kind of has that little
drag<00:01:29.860> effect<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.380> if<00:01:32.440> you're

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
drag effect to it but if you're

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.890 
drag effect to it but if you're
sprinting<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.950> can't<00:01:33.159> really<00:01:33.280> tell<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.520> guess

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
sprinting you can't really tell I guess

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.140 
sprinting you can't really tell I guess
but<00:01:34.900> this<00:01:35.050> opens<00:01:35.260> up<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.590> lot<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.770> doors<00:01:36.150> of

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
but this opens up a lot of doors of

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.640 
but this opens up a lot of doors of
possibility<00:01:37.390> pretty<00:01:38.110> much<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.680> lot<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:38.980> windows

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
possibility pretty much a lot of windows

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.710 
possibility pretty much a lot of windows
one<00:01:41.650> very<00:01:42.159> obvious<00:01:42.190> one<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.610> proppant<00:01:43.150> you<00:01:43.600> can

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
one very obvious one is proppant you can

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.180 
one very obvious one is proppant you can
disguise<00:01:43.990> yourself<00:01:44.350> as<00:01:44.409> blocks<00:01:44.680> -<00:01:44.920> I'll

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
disguise yourself as blocks - I'll

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.440 
disguise yourself as blocks - I'll
explain<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:45.640> later<00:01:45.700> though<00:01:46.030> cuz<00:01:46.240> there's<00:01:46.420> a

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
explain that later though cuz there's a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.050 
explain that later though cuz there's a
couple<00:01:47.290> flaws<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.830> too<00:01:48.040> so<00:01:48.729> first<00:01:48.940> of

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
couple flaws with that too so first of

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.060 
couple flaws with that too so first of
all<00:01:49.150> as<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> mushroom<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.620> way<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.830> works

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
all as a mushroom the way this works

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.590 
all as a mushroom the way this works
basically<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.580> it's<00:01:51.820> setting<00:01:52.479> a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
basically is that it's setting a

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.750 
basically is that it's setting a
mushroom<00:01:52.960> at<00:01:53.229> your<00:01:53.380> location<00:01:53.830> but<00:01:54.220> it's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
mushroom at your location but it's

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.820 
mushroom at your location but it's
erasing<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.450> soon<00:01:55.570> as<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.750> get<00:01:55.810> off<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.530> if

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
erasing it as soon as you get off so if

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.289 
erasing it as soon as you get off so if
we<00:01:56.920> go<00:01:57.040> on<00:01:57.159> top<00:01:57.340> there's<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.549> redstone<00:01:57.790> it'll

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
we go on top there's a redstone it'll

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.940 
we go on top there's a redstone it'll
erase<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.810> redstone<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.229> replace<00:01:59.740> it<00:01:59.890> the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
erase the redstone and replace it the

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.219 
erase the redstone and replace it the
mushroom<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:00.880> that's<00:02:01.030> kind<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.360> sucks<00:02:01.600> doesn't

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
mushroom so that's kind of sucks doesn't

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.170 
mushroom so that's kind of sucks doesn't
seem<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.530> pressure<00:02:02.680> plates<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.700> can<00:02:03.820> step<00:02:04.030> on

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
seem to pressure plates you can step on

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.280 
seem to pressure plates you can step on
them<00:02:04.299> but<00:02:04.479> then<00:02:04.630> they<00:02:04.720> disappear

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
them but then they disappear

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.110 
them but then they disappear
sadly<00:02:06.159> does<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.400> same<00:02:06.549> with<00:02:06.640> doors<00:02:06.850> too

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
sadly does the same with doors too

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.430 
sadly does the same with doors too
because<00:02:07.330> you're<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.630> same<00:02:07.780> block<00:02:08.049> as<00:02:08.319> the

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
because you're in the same block as the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.530 
because you're in the same block as the
door<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.009> just<00:02:09.190> gets<00:02:09.250> her<00:02:09.399> out<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.580> door

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.059 

with<00:02:13.540> something<00:02:13.959> with<00:02:14.049> torches<00:02:14.319> obviously<00:02:14.709> it

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
with something with torches obviously it

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.220 
with something with torches obviously it
only<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.459> oops<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.870> get<00:02:16.989> out<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> here

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
only goes oops if I can get out of here

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.890 
only goes oops if I can get out of here
little<00:02:17.409> bit<00:02:17.500> yeah<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.819> only<00:02:18.940> replaces<00:02:19.750> where

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
little bit yeah it only replaces where

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.149 
little bit yeah it only replaces where
the<00:02:19.959> mushroom<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.409> not<00:02:20.620> where<00:02:20.739> your<00:02:20.860> character

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
the mushroom is not where your character

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.610 
the mushroom is not where your character
is<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.879> block<00:02:22.060> tall<00:02:22.329> place

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
is so this is to block tall place

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.589 
is so this is to block tall place
obviously<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.859> little<00:02:24.459> torch<00:02:25.299> I'm<00:02:25.450> not

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
obviously there's a little torch I'm not

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.360 
obviously there's a little torch I'm not
getting<00:02:26.079> rid<00:02:26.170> of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
getting rid of

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.009 
getting rid of
even<00:02:26.580> though<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.819> inside<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> same<00:02:27.720> block

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
even though I'm inside the same block

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.420 
even though I'm inside the same block
areas<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.830> because<00:02:29.069> I'm<00:02:29.159> not<00:02:29.220> tall

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
areas it that's because I'm not tall

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610 
areas it that's because I'm not tall
enough<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.730> if<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.849> jump<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:31.049> gets<00:02:31.319> rid<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
enough so if you jump it gets rid of it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.140 
enough so if you jump it gets rid of it
I<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> cute<00:02:32.580> thing<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.879> don't<00:02:32.940> you

I think it's a cute thing I don't you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.550 
I think it's a cute thing I don't you
jump<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.769> this<00:02:34.769> makes<00:02:34.980> me<00:02:35.069> feel<00:02:35.250> happy<00:02:36.560> some

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
jump in this makes me feel happy some

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.080 
jump in this makes me feel happy some
weird<00:02:37.709> things<00:02:37.920> like<00:02:38.159> if<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.489> plot<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> sword

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
weird things like if you plot a sword

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.500 
weird things like if you plot a sword
obviously<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.599> way<00:02:39.750> up<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.610> don't

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
obviously it's way up here but I don't

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.780 
obviously it's way up here but I don't
know<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.810> think<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.799> still<00:02:43.920> awesome<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.700> I'm

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
excited before I show you the clans I'm

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.970 
excited before I show you the clans I'm
actually<00:02:47.549> gonna<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:48.360> ahead<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.510> show<00:02:49.049> you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
actually gonna go ahead and show you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.229 
actually gonna go ahead and show you
that<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.340> do<00:02:50.400> with<00:02:50.519> other<00:02:50.700> things<00:02:50.879> right

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
that you can do with other things right

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.089 
that you can do with other things right
now<00:02:51.329> I'm<00:02:51.420> using<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.690> brown<00:02:52.049> mushroom<00:02:52.500> go<00:02:52.920> ahead

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
now I'm using a brown mushroom go ahead

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.390 
now I'm using a brown mushroom go ahead
and<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.310> glass<00:02:53.549> instead<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.920> reason<00:02:55.920> glass<00:02:56.129> for

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and do glass instead a reason glass for

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.390 
and do glass instead a reason glass for
a<00:02:56.430> reason<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.620> use<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:58.920> with<00:02:58.980> other<00:02:59.160> blocks

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
a reason if you use it with other blocks

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
a reason if you use it with other blocks
you<00:03:00.090> don't<00:03:00.239> suffocate<00:03:00.540> because<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:01.140> inside

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you don't suffocate because it's inside

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.910 
you don't suffocate because it's inside
of<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.870> bottom<00:03:03.870> part<00:03:04.200> of<00:03:04.290> your<00:03:04.349> body<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.829> guess

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
of the bottom part of your body I guess

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
of the bottom part of your body I guess
you<00:03:05.190> would<00:03:05.280> say<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:08.250> does<00:03:08.400> suck<00:03:08.670> because

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
you would say but it does suck because

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.180 
you would say but it does suck because
you<00:03:09.540> can't<00:03:09.810> move<00:03:10.019> around<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.560> basically

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
you can't move around in it basically

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.470 
you can't move around in it basically
you<00:03:11.280> can't<00:03:11.430> move<00:03:11.519> around<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.879> just<00:03:12.060> keep<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
you can't move around you just keep it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.780 
you can't move around you just keep it
moves<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.590> glass<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.040> transparent<00:03:14.730> so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
moves you but glass is transparent so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.289 
moves you but glass is transparent so
therefore<00:03:16.549> got<00:03:17.549> stuck<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:17.970> went<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
therefore got stuck as I went on the

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.649 
therefore got stuck as I went on the
side<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.690> yet<00:03:18.780> glass<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.140> transparent<00:03:19.709> so

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
side but yet glass is transparent so

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.490 
side but yet glass is transparent so
there<00:03:21.659> are<00:03:21.720> some<00:03:21.780> other<00:03:21.959> transparent<00:03:22.379> things

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
there are some other transparent things

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.000 
there are some other transparent things
like<00:03:22.650> stairs<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:24.170> glowstone<00:03:25.170> sure<00:03:25.620> whatever

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
like stairs and glowstone sure whatever

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
like stairs and glowstone sure whatever
there<00:03:26.220> are<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> lot<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> different<00:03:26.730> things

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
there are a lot of different things

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.509 
there are a lot of different things
I<00:03:27.329> think<00:03:27.810> chests<00:03:28.230> are<00:03:28.349> transparent<00:03:29.069> cauldrons

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
I think chests are transparent cauldrons

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.370 
I think chests are transparent cauldrons
so<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.450> like<00:03:30.569> proud<00:03:30.750> punk<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.079> still

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
so it's like proud punk is still

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.720 
so it's like proud punk is still
possible<00:03:31.829> just<00:03:32.099> not<00:03:32.250> with<00:03:32.340> every<00:03:32.579> single

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
possible just not with every single

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.610 
possible just not with every single
block<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> game<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:34.049> don't<00:03:34.380> know<00:03:34.560> if

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
block in the game I don't know if

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.870 
block in the game I don't know if
there's<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.829> fix<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.250> that'd<00:03:35.639> be<00:03:35.760> pretty

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
there's a fix for that that'd be pretty

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.900 
there's a fix for that that'd be pretty
cool<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.209> guys<00:03:36.269> can<00:03:36.480> find<00:03:36.690> one<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.109> I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
cool if you guys can find one but I

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.940 
cool if you guys can find one but I
still<00:03:38.910> think<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.209> pretty<00:03:39.419> cool<00:03:39.599> so<00:03:39.950> it's

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
still think it's pretty cool so it's

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.500 
still think it's pretty cool so it's
like<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.519> want<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.790> set<00:03:42.000> something<00:03:42.299> up<00:03:42.359> real

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
like I want to set something up real

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.559 
like I want to set something up real
quick<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.780> haven't<00:03:42.959> really<00:03:43.109> tried<00:03:43.230> this

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.729 

oh<00:03:51.370> yeah<00:03:52.370> okay<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.150> makes<00:03:53.299> more<00:03:53.480> sense<00:03:53.739> I

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
oh yeah okay that makes more sense I

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.949 
oh yeah okay that makes more sense I
forgot<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.640> glass<00:03:55.909> so<00:03:56.359> that's<00:03:56.659> one

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
forgot that it's glass so that's one

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.860 
forgot that it's glass so that's one
flaw<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.349> system<00:03:57.500> yes<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:59.510> you<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.689> set

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
flaw in the system yes but you can set

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.630 
flaw in the system yes but you can set
it<00:03:59.959> up<00:04:00.019> all<00:04:00.200> around<00:04:00.319> in<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.650> area<00:04:00.829> too<00:04:01.219> so<00:04:01.250> it

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
it up all around in the area too so it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.280 
it up all around in the area too so it
could<00:04:01.760> be<00:04:01.790> like<00:04:01.939> this<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.359> it's<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
could be like this and it's like the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.720 
could be like this and it's like the
main<00:04:03.439> point<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.709> problem<00:04:04.040> is<00:04:04.159> I<00:04:04.250> get<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.489> find

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
main point of problem is I get to find

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.319 
main point of problem is I get to find
the<00:04:05.180> disguised<00:04:05.930> player<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:07.000> kill<00:04:08.000> him<00:04:08.120> so

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
the disguised player and kill him so

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.550 
the disguised player and kill him so
it's<00:04:08.450> like<00:04:08.599> you<00:04:08.689> sit<00:04:08.870> here<00:04:08.989> next<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.409> but

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
it's like you sit here next to it but

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.720 
it's like you sit here next to it but
you<00:04:09.620> can't<00:04:09.799> just<00:04:09.980> be<00:04:10.069> directly<00:04:10.430> on<00:04:10.519> them

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
you can't just be directly on them

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.399 
you can't just be directly on them
because<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.540> way<00:04:11.659> this<00:04:11.810> works<00:04:12.019> is<00:04:12.170> that<00:04:12.230> it

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
because the way this works is that it

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.839 
because the way this works is that it
gets<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.650> red<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.859> glass<00:04:13.099> in<00:04:13.459> your<00:04:13.579> area

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
gets the red of glass in your area

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.140 
gets the red of glass in your area
pretty<00:04:14.030> much<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:15.130> yeah<00:04:16.130> or<00:04:16.370> brown<00:04:16.820> mushroom

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
pretty much so yeah or brown mushroom

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.990 
pretty much so yeah or brown mushroom
whatever<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.780> set<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:19.150> replace<00:04:22.360> brown

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
whatever you set it up replace brown

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.460 
whatever you set it up replace brown
mushroom<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:27.650> then<00:04:29.110> okay<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.139> I'll<00:04:30.349> explain

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
mushroom and then okay so I'll explain

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.810 
mushroom and then okay so I'll explain
command<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.919> little<00:04:30.979> bit<00:04:31.160> first<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.580> right<00:04:32.150> now

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
command a little bit first so right now

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.060 
command a little bit first so right now
this<00:04:34.820> command<00:04:35.259> that's<00:04:36.259> being<00:04:36.440> activated<00:04:36.889> by

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
this command that's being activated by

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.379 
this command that's being activated by
that<00:04:37.099> very<00:04:37.340> fast<00:04:37.580> clock<00:04:37.759> is<00:04:37.970> an<00:04:38.060> execute

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
that very fast clock is an execute

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.040 
that very fast clock is an execute
command<00:04:38.660> for<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.500> e-tag<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:40.460> my<00:04:40.940> name<00:04:41.150> and

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
command for the e-tag of my name and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.450 
command for the e-tag of my name and
it's<00:04:42.199> relative<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.620> me<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:42.949> it's<00:04:43.070> filling<00:04:43.340> the

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
it's relative to me and it's filling the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.110 
it's relative to me and it's filling the
surrounding<00:04:43.820> area<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.150> me<00:04:44.479> with<00:04:45.380> air<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.310> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
surrounding area of me with air and the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.240 
surrounding area of me with air and the
only<00:04:47.270> things<00:04:47.780> that's<00:04:47.960> filling<00:04:48.229> with<00:04:48.320> air<00:04:48.349> are

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
only things that's filling with air are

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.189 
only things that's filling with air are
brown<00:04:49.520> mushrooms<00:04:49.910> so<00:04:50.090> right<00:04:50.210> now<00:04:50.360> obviously

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
brown mushrooms so right now obviously

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.360 
brown mushrooms so right now obviously
it's<00:04:51.349> not<00:04:51.440> going<00:04:51.560> around<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> glass<00:04:51.979> anymore

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
it's not going around the glass anymore

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.710 
it's not going around the glass anymore
because<00:04:52.460> there's<00:04:52.669> no<00:04:52.759> brown<00:04:52.970> mushrooms<00:04:53.389> it's

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
because there's no brown mushrooms it's

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.939 
because there's no brown mushrooms it's
not<00:04:53.840> getting<00:04:54.020> rid<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.139> glass<00:04:54.349> if<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.650> put<00:04:54.830> that

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
not getting rid of glass if you put that

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:56.560 
not getting rid of glass if you put that
glass<00:04:55.159> now<00:04:55.639> if<00:04:55.789> you<00:04:55.880> put<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.150> commandest

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
glass now if you put that commandest

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.839 
glass now if you put that commandest
glass<00:04:56.780> instead<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.110> brown<00:04:57.260> mushrooms<00:04:57.849> it

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
glass instead of brown mushrooms it

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.430 
glass instead of brown mushrooms it
would<00:04:58.970> be<00:04:59.060> getting<00:04:59.150> rid<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.659> glass<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.050> I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
would be getting rid of the glass that I

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.930 
would be getting rid of the glass that I
just<00:05:00.800> left<00:05:01.039> pretty<00:05:01.430> much<00:05:01.550> because<00:05:01.729> it<00:05:01.789> was<00:05:01.849> in

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
just left pretty much because it was in

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.430 
just left pretty much because it was in
the<00:05:02.000> surrounding<00:05:02.330> area<00:05:02.539> of<00:05:02.599> me<00:05:02.720> that's<00:05:03.229> also

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
the surrounding area of me that's also

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.110 
the surrounding area of me that's also
why<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.680> could<00:05:03.860> spread<00:05:04.010> out<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.190> glass<00:05:04.430> that's

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
why I could spread out the glass that's

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.110 
why I could spread out the glass that's
next<00:05:05.449> to<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.810> too<00:05:06.500> even<00:05:06.949> if<00:05:07.159> you're<00:05:07.250> not<00:05:07.340> on

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
next to you too even if you're not on

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.060 
next to you too even if you're not on
top<00:05:08.389> of<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:08.630> or<00:05:08.720> something<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.740> that<00:05:09.770> kind<00:05:10.010> of

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
top of it or something so that kind of

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.439 
top of it or something so that kind of
sucks

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
sucks

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.550 
sucks
oh<00:05:11.860> yeah<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.159> in<00:05:13.370> this<00:05:13.520> command<00:05:13.760> is<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.419> X<00:05:15.349> cube

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
oh yeah and in this command is a X cube

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.260 
oh yeah and in this command is a X cube
from<00:05:15.680> an<00:05:15.830> entirety<00:05:16.070> me<00:05:16.400> relative<00:05:17.000> to<00:05:17.120> me

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
from an entirety me relative to me

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.330 
from an entirety me relative to me
that's<00:05:17.539> setting<00:05:17.840> a<00:05:17.900> block<00:05:18.169> and<00:05:18.530> right<00:05:19.190> now

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
that's setting a block and right now

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:26.159 
that's setting a block and right now
it's<00:05:19.639> glass<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:21.979> it's<00:05:22.479> yeah<00:05:23.919> if<00:05:24.919> we<00:05:25.070> go<00:05:25.220> to

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
it's glass and it's yeah if we go to

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:35.050 
it's glass and it's yeah if we go to
brown<00:05:28.389> mush<00:05:30.789> yep<00:05:32.349> it'll<00:05:33.460> leave<00:05:34.460> us<00:05:34.580> glass<00:05:34.789> here

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
brown mush yep it'll leave us glass here

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.240 
brown mush yep it'll leave us glass here
but<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.720> mushroom<00:05:36.020> idea<00:05:36.470> will<00:05:36.770> remain<00:05:37.159> the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
but the mushroom idea will remain the

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.610 
but the mushroom idea will remain the
same<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.720> we<00:05:38.810> can<00:05:38.930> step<00:05:39.080> on<00:05:39.260> things<00:05:39.440> it's

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
same so so we can step on things it's

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.990 
same so so we can step on things it's
not<00:05:39.740> going<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.919> break<00:05:40.039> it<00:05:40.250> unless<00:05:40.639> if<00:05:40.820> it's<00:05:40.940> a

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
not going to break it unless if it's a

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.740 
not going to break it unless if it's a
brown<00:05:41.150> mushroom<00:05:41.570> and<00:05:41.840> yeah<00:05:43.120> or<00:05:44.120> unless<00:05:44.570> if

you're<00:05:44.870> inside<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.260> same<00:05:45.409> block<00:05:45.650> which<00:05:46.250> is

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
you're inside the same block which is

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.379 
you're inside the same block which is
only<00:05:47.770> I'm<00:05:48.770> just<00:05:49.220> kind<00:05:49.340> of<00:05:49.370> sucks<00:05:49.610> that<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.240> gets

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
only I'm just kind of sucks that it gets

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.580 
only I'm just kind of sucks that it gets
rid<00:05:50.509> of<00:05:50.539> doors<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.960> stuff<00:05:51.080> but<00:05:51.289> I<00:05:51.349> mean<00:05:51.500> it's

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
rid of doors and stuff but I mean it's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.159
