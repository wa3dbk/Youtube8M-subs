00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
they just want to keep on doing it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.910 
they just want to keep on doing it
because<00:02:56.180> they<00:02:56.420> like<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:56.870> not<00:02:57.680> just

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
because they like it and not just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.860 
because they like it and not just
because<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.459> money<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.000> even<00:02:59.750> though

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
because of the money and even though

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.210 
because of the money and even though
they're<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.139> there<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.530> money<00:03:00.739> then<00:03:00.980> I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
they're in there for the money then I

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.680 
they're in there for the money then I
think<00:03:01.459> they<00:03:01.549> still<00:03:01.730> deserve<00:03:01.879> it<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.389> my<00:03:02.629> next

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
think they still deserve it and my next

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.750 
think they still deserve it and my next
and<00:03:03.079> final<00:03:03.260> point<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:03.829> video<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.370> you're

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
and final point of this video is you're

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.490 
and final point of this video is you're
not<00:03:04.879> losing<00:03:05.090> anything<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:05.780> why<00:03:05.930> why<00:03:06.349> do<00:03:06.409> you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
not losing anything so why why do you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.410 
not losing anything so why why do you
care<00:03:06.799> whether<00:03:07.069> youtubers<00:03:07.639> make<00:03:07.670> money<00:03:08.090> or<00:03:08.209> not

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
care whether youtubers make money or not

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.780 
care whether youtubers make money or not
because<00:03:09.109> I<00:03:09.319> mean<00:03:09.680> you're<00:03:09.920> only<00:03:10.010> giving<00:03:10.370> up<00:03:10.459> 20

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
because I mean you're only giving up 20

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.879 
because I mean you're only giving up 20
seconds<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.209> your<00:03:11.239> time<00:03:11.359> to<00:03:11.540> watch<00:03:11.750> nad<00:03:12.170> most

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
seconds of your time to watch nad most

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.559 
seconds of your time to watch nad most
of<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.069> times<00:03:13.310> it's<00:03:13.670> like<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.819> five<00:03:14.060> second<00:03:14.450> app

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
of the times it's like a five second app

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.610 
of the times it's like a five second app
because<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:14.959> skip<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.290> right<00:03:15.500> away

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
because you can just skip it right away

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.619 
because you can just skip it right away
but<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.639> mean<00:03:16.849> you're<00:03:16.970> not<00:03:17.060> giving<00:03:17.359> up<00:03:17.480> anything

but I mean you're not giving up anything
you<00:03:17.930> know<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.379> your<00:03:19.099> youtuber<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:19.879> would<00:03:20.030> want
