the<00:01:50.250> thing<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> i<00:01:50.850> personally<00:01:51.210> think

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
the thing that i personally think

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.539 
the thing that i personally think
instead<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.040> throwing<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.280> bunch<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
instead of just throwing a bunch of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.249 
instead of just throwing a bunch of
scenarios<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> personally<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.049> this

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
scenarios what I personally think this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.800 
scenarios what I personally think this
is<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.710> he<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.119> coming<00:01:57.240> back<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
is is he will be coming back for the

short<00:01:58.020> term<00:01:58.200> um<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.820> mean<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:00.689> februari

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
short term um I mean it's what februari

it's on a sunday what I think this
is<00:02:14.070> just<00:02:14.400> because<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.790> time<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
is just because the time that it is and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.620 
is just because the time that it is and
w.e<00:02:17.100> needing<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> pull<00:02:17.880> out<00:02:18.000> every<00:02:18.180> stuff<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
w.e needing to pull out every stuff that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.540 
w.e needing to pull out every stuff that
they<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.930> arrest<00:02:19.110> under<00:02:19.380> 30<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.340> but

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
they can arrest under 30 and because but

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.570 
they can arrest under 30 and because but

paved<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> way<00:03:02.700> with<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.150> type<00:03:03.360> of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
paved the way with these type of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.870 
paved the way with these type of
contracts<00:03:03.990> that<00:03:04.320> require<00:03:04.770> minimal<00:03:05.310> dates<00:03:05.580> and

big<00:03:06.240> money<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.810> think<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.620> he<00:03:07.770> stuck<00:03:08.040> may<00:03:08.400> not

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
big money I think but he stuck may not

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
big money I think but he stuck may not
get<00:03:08.760> as<00:03:08.880> big<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.120> contract<00:03:09.660> as<00:03:09.870> Brock<00:03:10.170> Lesnar

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

certainly not the rock but he can get
something<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.740> his<00:03:13.890> own<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.430> think<00:03:14.910> he's<00:03:15.060> you
