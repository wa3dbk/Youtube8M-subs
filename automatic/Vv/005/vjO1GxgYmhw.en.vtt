than the style of a dime bag Darrell now

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.470 
than the style of a dime bag Darrell now
this<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.190> a<00:00:33.219> technique<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.700> he<00:00:33.910> used<00:00:33.940> in<00:00:34.329> like

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
this is a technique that he used in like

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.600 
this is a technique that he used in like
the<00:00:34.600> walk<00:00:34.809> solo<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.590> a<00:00:35.649> couple<00:00:36.129> other<00:00:36.280> places

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
the walk solo and a couple other places

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.810 
the walk solo and a couple other places
where<00:00:37.420> he<00:00:37.539> uses<00:00:37.960> two<00:00:38.320> overlapping<00:00:39.070> hands<00:00:39.520> to

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
where he uses two overlapping hands to

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.479 
where he uses two overlapping hands to
create<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.180> series<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.870> slides<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.649> sound

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
create a series of slides that sound

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.819 
create a series of slides that sound
kind<00:00:42.760> of<00:00:42.820> continuous<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.810> you<00:00:44.440> can't<00:00:44.680> really

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
kind of continuous and you can't really

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.290 
kind of continuous and you can't really
get<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.100> sound<00:00:45.370> with<00:00:45.579> just<00:00:45.760> using<00:00:46.060> one<00:00:46.270> hand

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
get that sound with just using one hand

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.800 
get that sound with just using one hand
so<00:00:47.230> we'll<00:00:47.380> quickly<00:00:47.470> take<00:00:47.829> a<00:00:47.860> look<00:00:47.950> at<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.810> the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
so we'll quickly take a look at it the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.150 
so we'll quickly take a look at it the
slide<00:00:50.110> part<00:00:50.380> of<00:00:50.500> what<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.649> was<00:00:50.860> just<00:00:50.890> doing

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
slide part of what I was just doing

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.610 
slide part of what I was just doing
there<00:00:51.520> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.870> concept<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.470> you're<00:00:53.530> gonna

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
there is the concept is you're gonna

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.290 
there is the concept is you're gonna
start<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:54.130> slide<00:00:54.430> I'm<00:00:54.670> gonna<00:00:54.850> start<00:00:55.030> here<00:00:55.149> at

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
start a slide I'm gonna start here at

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.860 
start a slide I'm gonna start here at
the<00:00:55.390> second<00:00:56.290> fret<00:00:56.440> on<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> g<00:00:56.950> string

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the second fret on the g string

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.990 
the second fret on the g string
just<00:00:58.870> hammer<00:00:59.050> onto<00:00:59.350> that<00:00:59.530> note<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.010> slide<00:01:00.850> it

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
just hammer onto that note and slide it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.410 
just hammer onto that note and slide it
up<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.550> you<00:01:03.640> don't<00:01:03.820> necessarily<00:01:03.880> have<00:01:04.299> to

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
up now you don't necessarily have to

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.600 
up now you don't necessarily have to
slide<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:05.079> any<00:01:05.229> specific<00:01:05.409> point<00:01:08.280> okay<00:01:09.280> and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
slide to any specific point okay and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.310 
slide to any specific point okay and
then<00:01:10.180> you're<00:01:10.299> gonna<00:01:10.390> take<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.840> same<00:01:11.020> thing

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
then you're gonna take the same thing

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440 
then you're gonna take the same thing
and<00:01:11.619> you're<00:01:11.740> gonna<00:01:11.829> tap<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.759> with<00:01:13.000> your<00:01:13.240> index

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
and you're gonna tap it with your index

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.359 
and you're gonna tap it with your index
finger<00:01:14.020> now<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.560> can<00:01:14.829> do<00:01:14.920> with<00:01:15.040> your<00:01:15.189> middle

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
finger now you can do with your middle

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.849 
finger now you can do with your middle
finger<00:01:15.490> as<00:01:15.759> well<00:01:15.789> I<00:01:16.209> like<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.569> move<00:01:16.749> my<00:01:17.079> pick<00:01:17.649> to

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
finger as well I like to move my pick to

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.199 
finger as well I like to move my pick to
my<00:01:17.979> middle<00:01:18.159> finger<00:01:18.459> and<00:01:18.490> hold<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:18.819> between<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
my middle finger and hold it between the

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:21.209 
my middle finger and hold it between the
two<00:01:19.959> joints<00:01:20.259> of<00:01:20.409> my<00:01:20.469> middle<00:01:20.709> finger<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.069> then

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
two joints of my middle finger and then

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.870 
two joints of my middle finger and then
just<00:01:21.280> whole<00:01:21.759> top<00:01:22.689> note<00:01:22.959> and<00:01:23.590> slide<00:01:24.490> up<00:01:24.639> and<00:01:24.789> try

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
just whole top note and slide up and try

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760 
just whole top note and slide up and try
to<00:01:24.939> do<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.179> exact<00:01:25.509> same<00:01:25.539> thing<00:01:26.139> with<00:01:26.590> that

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
to do the exact same thing with that

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
to do the exact same thing with that
hand<00:01:27.100> now<00:01:27.279> the<00:01:27.880> key<00:01:28.179> to<00:01:28.209> getting<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.659> to

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
hand now the key to getting this to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.319 
hand now the key to getting this to
sound<00:01:29.979> consistent<00:01:30.759> is<00:01:30.939> when<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.840> do<00:01:31.990> one<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
sound consistent is when you do one the

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.910 
sound consistent is when you do one the
other<00:01:34.569> one<00:01:34.779> is<00:01:34.929> going<00:01:35.139> to<00:01:35.259> that<00:01:35.469> point<00:01:35.709> where

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
other one is going to that point where

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.289 
other one is going to that point where
you<00:01:36.009> just<00:01:36.189> start<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:36.999> there<00:01:37.179> basically

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you just start it so there basically

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.419 
you just start it so there basically
when<00:01:38.170> one's<00:01:38.439> coming<00:01:38.799> up<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.039> neck<00:01:39.219> the<00:01:39.399> other

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
when one's coming up the neck the other

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.760 
when one's coming up the neck the other
one<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.850> going<00:01:39.999> down<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.749> neck<00:01:40.929> and<00:01:41.200> vice

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
one is going down the neck and vice

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.109 
one is going down the neck and vice
versa<00:01:42.099> so<00:01:42.429> we<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:44.459> so<00:01:45.459> and<00:01:45.789> then<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.029> get

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
versa so we have so and then you get

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:59.950 
versa so we have so and then you get
your<00:01:46.329> right<00:01:46.479> there<00:01:46.659> at<00:01:46.749> the<00:01:46.840> a

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.800 

and<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:01.340> last<00:02:01.520> one<00:02:01.760> he<00:02:01.850> usually<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.210> he

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
and the last one he usually just he

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.150 
and the last one he usually just he
results<00:02:03.140> he's<00:02:03.290> not<00:02:03.440> really<00:02:03.560> sliding<00:02:04.040> to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
results he's not really sliding to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.610 
results he's not really sliding to
really<00:02:04.310> specific<00:02:04.820> points<00:02:05.210> too<00:02:05.360> much<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.350> last

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
really specific points too much the last

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.230 
really specific points too much the last
one<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.950> he'll<00:02:07.100> slide<00:02:07.340> up<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.610> resolve<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.179> a

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
one that he'll slide up and resolve to a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.719 
one that he'll slide up and resolve to a
specific<00:02:08.780> note<00:02:09.050> so<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.340> very<00:02:10.610> easy

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
specific note so it's a very easy

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.450 
specific note so it's a very easy
concept<00:02:11.210> simple<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.080> understand<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:12.980> can<00:02:13.370> be

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
concept simple to understand but can be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.160 
concept simple to understand but can be
a<00:02:13.490> little<00:02:13.670> bit<00:02:13.850> tricky<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.780> thing<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.020> want

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
a little bit tricky one thing you want

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.000 
a little bit tricky one thing you want
to<00:02:15.230> watch<00:02:15.410> out<00:02:15.710> for<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.100> when<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.340> slide<00:02:16.610> up<00:02:18.010> to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
to watch out for is when you slide up to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.720 
to watch out for is when you slide up to
let<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.490> note<00:02:19.820> off<00:02:20.170> right<00:02:21.170> when<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.730> top

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
let this note off right when you top

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.160 
let this note off right when you top
that<00:02:22.760> one<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.360> might<00:02:23.480> find<00:02:23.690> yourself<00:02:24.050> one
