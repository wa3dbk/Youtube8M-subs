00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
don't like this idea of this power bank

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.010 
don't like this idea of this power bank
because<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.760> kind<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> weird<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.600> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
because it's kind of weird that you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.880 
because it's kind of weird that you
can't<00:00:19.760> use<00:00:20.760> your<00:00:20.789> phone<00:00:21.270> with<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> big<00:00:22.619> box

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
can't use your phone with a big box

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.210 
can't use your phone with a big box
behind<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> charger<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.070> want

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
behind it or with a charger if you want

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.589 
behind it or with a charger if you want
to<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.970> gonna<00:00:27.150> work<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.090> one

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to see how this gonna work this in one

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:53.569 
to see how this gonna work this in one
second<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.800> plug<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:52.579> missed

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
second and you plug it into the missed

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.810 
second and you plug it into the missed
you<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.090> should<00:00:54.390> charge<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you it should charge now but this does a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
you it should charge now but this does a
lot<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.660> complete<00:00:58.260> completely<00:00:59.010> run

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lot because it's complete completely run

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
lot because it's complete completely run
out<00:00:59.899> okay<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:02.579> phone<00:01:03.180> battery<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:05.270> 2100<00:01:06.270> mAh

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
out okay so my phone battery is 2100 mAh

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
out okay so my phone battery is 2100 mAh
and<00:01:07.250> there<00:01:08.250> should<00:01:08.490> be<00:01:09.770> 12,000<00:01:10.770> ma<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and there should be 12,000 ma so if you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.830 
and there should be 12,000 ma so if you
calculate<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.140> should<00:01:13.500> charge<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:14.040> least<00:01:14.840> 5.7

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
calculate it should charge at least 5.7

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
calculate it should charge at least 5.7
time<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> didn't<00:01:18.119> i<00:01:18.650> charged<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.830> three

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
time but it didn't i charged it three

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.469 
time but it didn't i charged it three
four<00:01:20.939> times<00:01:21.860> then<00:01:22.860> i<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.040> left<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:23.909> at

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
four times then i just left it there at

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.440 
four times then i just left it there at
night<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.860> 82<00:01:26.810> morning<00:01:27.810> four<00:01:28.020> o'clock

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
night so is 82 morning four o'clock

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.649 
night so is 82 morning four o'clock
therefore<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.409> calculate<00:01:31.920> eyes<00:01:32.659> let's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
therefore if you calculate eyes let's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.190 
therefore if you calculate eyes let's
keep<00:01:33.960> charging<00:01:34.290> therefore<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:36.150> did<00:01:36.390> work<00:01:36.900> up

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
keep charging therefore it did work up

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
keep charging therefore it did work up
to<00:01:37.229> at<00:01:37.560> least<00:01:37.710> five<00:01:38.009> time<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.860> if<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.369> iphone

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to at least five time so if your iphone

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.370
