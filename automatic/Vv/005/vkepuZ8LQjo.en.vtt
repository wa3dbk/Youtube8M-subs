00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
kind of hard to get the lights to come

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
kind of hard to get the lights to come
on<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.379> seems<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> work<00:00:56.280> nicely<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.460> if<00:00:59.460> we

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
on but seems to work nicely and if we

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.510 
on but seems to work nicely and if we
start<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> thing<00:01:00.719> running

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
start the thing running

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.310 
start the thing running
just<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> prop<00:01:03.329> turning<00:01:05.840> by<00:01:06.840> twisting

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
just get the prop turning by twisting

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.830 
just get the prop turning by twisting
the<00:01:07.439> handle<00:01:09.290> clockwise<00:01:11.030> forward<00:01:12.030> direction

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.690 

you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.270> drawing<00:01:18.270> about<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
you can see that it is drawing about a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.690 
you can see that it is drawing about a
little<00:01:20.700> order<00:01:21.030> over<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.479> quarter<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.049> an<00:01:22.170> amp<00:01:22.700> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little order over a quarter of an amp to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.929 
little order over a quarter of an amp to
just<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> prop<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.640> bring<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
just get the prop going if we bring it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.350 
just get the prop going if we bring it
up<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.810> guess<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:32.360> halfway

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
up to about I guess it would be halfway

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.870 
up to about I guess it would be halfway
to<00:01:33.750> ten<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.280> speed<00:01:36.000> control<00:01:40.430> we're<00:01:41.430> at

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
to ten on the speed control we're at

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.139 
to ten on the speed control we're at
a<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:44.350> over<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.649> third<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.219> an<00:01:45.340> amp<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.880> bring

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
a little over a third of an amp we bring

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:07.230 
a little over a third of an amp we bring
it<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.360> to<00:01:52.720> about<00:01:52.930> 10<00:02:03.270> not<00:02:04.270> quite<00:02:04.630> making<00:02:06.240> any

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it up to about 10 not quite making any

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.930 
it up to about 10 not quite making any
mph<00:02:07.689> so<00:02:08.200> let's<00:02:08.440> I'm<00:02:09.069> just<00:02:09.340> going<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.519> turn<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
mph so let's I'm just going to turn the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.880 
mph so let's I'm just going to turn the
handle<00:02:12.599> bring<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.690> up<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.989> an<00:02:14.110> amp<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:16.890> guess

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
handle bring it up to an amp I guess

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.009 
handle bring it up to an amp I guess
that's<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.220> little<00:02:18.519> beyond<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.209> 10<00:02:19.480> mark<00:02:19.780> on

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
that's a little beyond the 10 mark on

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.870 
that's a little beyond the 10 mark on
the<00:02:20.170> speed<00:02:20.410> control<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:27.370> bring<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.700> right<00:02:27.819> up

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the speed control we bring it right up

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:42.620 
the speed control we bring it right up
to<00:02:28.150> 30<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:38.049> we're<00:02:38.319> drawing<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.799> little<00:02:38.950> over

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.229 

well<00:02:43.630> just<00:02:43.930> about<00:02:44.110> three<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.500> half<00:02:44.530> amps

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
well just about three and a half amps

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.660 
well just about three and a half amps
not<00:02:46.239> quite<00:02:46.599> sure<00:02:47.019> if<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.650> twist<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.280> handle<00:02:48.640> a

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
not quite sure if I twist a handle a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.940 
not quite sure if I twist a handle a
little<00:02:48.940> bit<00:02:49.090> we're<00:02:49.269> gonna<00:02:49.440> get<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> up<00:02:50.709> there

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
little bit we're gonna get it up there

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:01.590 
little bit we're gonna get it up there
to<00:02:51.489> three<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.910> half<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.910> test<00:03:01.150> tank<00:03:01.389> is

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
to three and a half the test tank is

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.879 
to three and a half the test tank is
probably<00:03:02.019> bill<00:03:02.410> about<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.910> about<00:03:03.910> half<00:03:04.299> the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
probably bill about it about half the

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.260 
probably bill about it about half the
without<00:03:05.889> really<00:03:06.130> making<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.609> mess

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.809 

in<00:03:10.250> about<00:03:11.250> half<00:03:11.520> speed<00:03:11.730> it's<00:03:12.090> drawn

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:23.510 

eight<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.000> half<00:03:16.030> amps<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.490> little<00:03:21.700> harder

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
eight and a half amps it a little harder

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.449 
eight and a half amps it a little harder
and<00:03:24.520> you<00:03:24.580> can<00:03:24.670> see<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.300> we're<00:03:25.680> almost<00:03:26.680> up<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
and you can see that we're almost up to

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:37.530 
and you can see that we're almost up to
ten<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.450> half<00:03:28.600> amps<00:03:35.970> drop<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.120> back<00:03:37.240> down<00:03:37.300> to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
ten and a half amps drop it back down to

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:48.360 
ten and a half amps drop it back down to
ten<00:03:37.959> again<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:47.950> hear<00:03:48.130> it's<00:03:48.250> very

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
ten again as you can hear it's very

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.110 
ten again as you can hear it's very
quiet

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
quiet

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.600 
quiet
very<00:03:49.959> smooth<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.800> handle<00:03:51.100> works<00:03:51.310> well<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
very smooth the handle works well the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.640 
very smooth the handle works well the
transom<00:03:57.610> clamp<00:03:57.910> unfortunately<00:03:58.570> is<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.959> glass

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
transom clamp unfortunately is a glass

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.610 
transom clamp unfortunately is a glass
filled<00:03:59.920> plastic<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.580> guess<00:04:01.180> it's<00:04:02.050> not<00:04:02.350> cast

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
filled plastic I guess it's not cast

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.770 
aluminum bill the rest of the hardware
is<00:04:05.200> marine<00:04:05.590> grade<00:04:06.330> appears<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.540> be<00:04:07.660> all

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
is marine grade appears to be all

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.430 
is marine grade appears to be all
stainless<00:04:08.290> steel<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:09.010> shaft<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:10.170> some<00:04:11.170> kind

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
stainless steel the shaft is some kind

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.540 
stainless steel the shaft is some kind
of<00:04:13.019> glass<00:04:14.019> or<00:04:14.260> graphite<00:04:14.739> composite<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.340> think

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
of glass or graphite composite I think

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.110 
of glass or graphite composite I think
it's<00:04:15.670> probably<00:04:15.940> fiberglass<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:21.280> shaft

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
it's probably fiberglass and the shaft

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.810 
it's probably fiberglass and the shaft
on<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:22.510> was<00:04:22.780> shortened

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.880 

here<00:04:29.460> it's<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.550> 36<00:04:31.090> inch<00:04:31.270> shaft<00:04:32.110> which<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.590> too

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
here it's a 36 inch shaft which is too

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.650 
here it's a 36 inch shaft which is too
long<00:04:33.130> for<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:33.490> small<00:04:33.940> boat<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.360> I'm<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.600> to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
long for the small boat so I'm going to

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.050 
long for the small boat so I'm going to
put<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.960> on<00:04:35.230> so<00:04:36.160> we<00:04:36.280> cut<00:04:36.490> off<00:04:36.610> about<00:04:36.880> eight

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
put this on so we cut off about eight

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.320 
put this on so we cut off about eight
and<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.240> half<00:04:37.270> inches<00:04:38.670> which<00:04:39.670> oh<00:04:40.030> there's<00:04:40.270> a

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
and a half inches which oh there's a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.510 
and a half inches which oh there's a
nice<00:04:40.480> procedure<00:04:40.930> or<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.440> similar<00:04:41.920> motor<00:04:42.160> on<00:04:42.400> the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
nice procedure or a similar motor on the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:52.560 
nice procedure or a similar motor on the
Internet<00:04:44.790> it's<00:04:45.790> not<00:04:46.000> too<00:04:46.210> hard<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:51.570> it's

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
Internet it's not too hard and it's

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.630 
Internet it's not too hard and it's
pretty<00:04:52.870> stabilized<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.770> about<00:04:53.980> speed<00:04:54.340> 10

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
pretty stabilized that it about speed 10

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:03.090 
pretty stabilized that it about speed 10
and<00:04:54.910> we're<00:04:55.270> drawing<00:04:59.370> the<00:05:00.370> 13<00:05:00.880> watts<00:05:01.890> but<00:05:02.890> just

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
and we're drawing the 13 watts but just

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.860 
and we're drawing the 13 watts but just
over<00:05:03.430> any<00:05:03.550> amp<00:05:06.480> unfortunately<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.540> don't<00:05:07.600> know

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
over any amp unfortunately I don't know

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.210 
over any amp unfortunately I don't know
how<00:05:09.360> what<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.510> amp<00:05:11.230> power<00:05:11.440> rating<00:05:11.950> on<00:05:12.070> this

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
how what the amp power rating on this

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.990 
how what the amp power rating on this
battery<00:05:12.640> is<00:05:12.790> it<00:05:12.970> says<00:05:13.260> 950<00:05:14.520> cranking<00:05:15.520> amps<00:05:15.850> at

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
battery is it says 950 cranking amps at

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.300 
battery is it says 950 cranking amps at
32<00:05:16.420> degrees<00:05:16.810> Fahrenheit<00:05:17.320> I'll<00:05:17.800> see<00:05:18.010> if<00:05:18.100> I<00:05:18.160> can

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
32 degrees Fahrenheit I'll see if I can

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.830 
32 degrees Fahrenheit I'll see if I can
find<00:05:18.460> some<00:05:18.700> kind<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:18.940> conversion<00:05:19.330> for<00:05:19.690> that

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
find some kind of conversion for that

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.440 
find some kind of conversion for that
but<00:05:20.310> they<00:05:21.310> generally<00:05:21.730> recommend<00:05:22.150> about<00:05:22.420> a

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
but they generally recommend about a

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.110 
but they generally recommend about a
hundred<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:22.990> five<00:05:23.200> amp<00:05:23.950> hour<00:05:24.220> battery<00:05:24.400> to<00:05:25.000> run

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
hundred and five amp hour battery to run

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.910 
hundred and five amp hour battery to run
these<00:05:25.300> things<00:05:25.360> with<00:05:25.810> this<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.200> quite<00:05:26.740> a<00:05:26.770> bit

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
these things with this is quite a bit

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.230 
these things with this is quite a bit
shy<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.520> give<00:05:27.850> it<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.030> size<00:05:29.970> but<00:05:30.970> I<00:05:31.270> think

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
shy of that give it a size but I think

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.150 
shy of that give it a size but I think
probably<00:05:34.240> get<00:05:34.600> a<00:05:34.630> good<00:05:35.020> three<00:05:35.440> or<00:05:35.560> four<00:05:35.770> hours

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
probably get a good three or four hours

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.390 
probably get a good three or four hours
of<00:05:36.310> run<00:05:36.520> time<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:37.330> know<00:05:37.480> at<00:05:37.860> moderate<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:39.220> low

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
of run time you know at moderate to low

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.530 
of run time you know at moderate to low
speed<00:05:39.460> with<00:05:40.060> this<00:05:42.090> okay<00:05:43.090> there<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.390> is

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
speed with this okay there it is

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
speed with this okay there it is
I<00:05:46.800> paid<00:05:47.800> about<00:05:48.390> $300<00:05:49.390> of<00:05:49.570> this<00:05:49.720> off<00:05:50.260> of<00:05:50.440> an

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
I paid about $300 of this off of an
