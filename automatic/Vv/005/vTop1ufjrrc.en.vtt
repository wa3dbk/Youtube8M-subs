00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 That's why I'm trying to start 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.900
 of the kilo agreement of flour 40 pieces 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.759
 with a kilo of flour and salt in this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 amount of bread I'm a little bit more 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 also how do you want me not to provide 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.100
 so much a new title half that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.750
 exactly juanito exactly the same as 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.439
 he put a lot of half a kilo of flour 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 it's 40 to a bollito returning one and a half 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.599
 I'm going to put in your tricks grams of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 Fresh Laura reaches us not ahead 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.450
 It is a prior torment or nothing because 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.200
 because it gets pretty hot and it's worth 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.190
 and in addition to dancing and more quality 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.530
 and since we speak 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.629
 and more than 40 so there's no heat like 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.430
 good and bad live there is that you have to go down 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.270
 the heat with water and wind although it is 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.310
 Well, the same 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.250
 with less than 2 m 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.040
 25 grams of yeast a little bit of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.940
 sugar day and helps activate faster 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.609
 this yeast activity 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.969
 the center generates contacts with the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.969
 yeast 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.799
 each other but 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 half a tablespoon 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.060
 I liked it in the past 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.170
 grab the soup spoon that flush 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.440
 they are 10 grams tufted are very good and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.400
 two guesses are fulfilled and tell us 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.060
 24 40 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.060
 and good 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 this was fulfilled by graduates up 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.060
 now half 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.009
 and starting with half kilo flour will 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 we put the grams to be in resin and 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.790
 the turn 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.490
 a little lele now 5 grams of the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.689
 alhambra 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.689
 of little by throwing water this summer 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.400
 I also had some solution 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.860
 that is not a sincere environment is a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.490
 refrigerated environment is that this is why 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.000
 bakers and metro 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.120
 according to the ambient temperature 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.890
 warm or cold in an exact folio in 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.650
 some bases at that point we're going to put 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.440
 more cool to retaliate I also be 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.660
 it says at room temperature how much of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.090
 water more or less is going to take the the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.880
 half of the 56th flour more 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.470
 also and put your people exactly 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 there soon zimmer 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.590
 is more in soft can replace 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.780
 we would pose with wick 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.780
 and put a teaspoon of butter 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.420
 one 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.030
 and every little bit more but not all 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.400
 40 25 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.590
 anytime 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.090
 see if we have one is also the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.860
 sky 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.860
 I could go why not 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.989
 and little by little we are already incorporating 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.989
 lines 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.769
 exactly if we notify them of the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.940
 amount of the situation here what 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.940
 it has a very expensive dough 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.630
 I am going to say 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:53.030
 but as the web of the vine I'm there 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.480
 that is to say more tender neither the legs 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.570
 josé luis díaz from teacher baker friend 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.570
 of the house great now the soft dough and 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.120
 tender crumb more talk about the domigo mass 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.540
 tender in the result and this will be kind 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.710
 and in what is the mother is very good and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.420
 we send you mentioning claudio 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.220
 lonely and to the bell ticket too 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.380
 that with great friends the house all the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.120
 great bakers but accompanies with a 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.180
 buy bakers skill 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.289
 now I'm way beyond killing them 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.289
 although more yearns to live 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.330
 it was making me 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.080
 more or less between SMEs 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.889
 let's put a limit more flour but 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.080
 we left both hands 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.289
 we want to put the cheese there that cites 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.289
 one 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.750
 so those seeds 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:01.100
 he said and of poppies or 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.100
 those that have 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.870
 herbs and wars that are also 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.100
 in doing this case you had where you had 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.740
 Adriano 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.889
 d 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.509
 the speed you look very basic of 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.509
 that wii grab visits 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.490
 A) Yes 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.310
 knead the dough 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.440
 to me 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.210
 in general he has learned from marquitos 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.210
 have a serve with both hands 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.490
 with one hand forwards and backwards 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.440
 but grammar teaches me this secret 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.560
 which is for with one hand for one side 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:57.360
 with exactly for easier and so 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:59.760
 also hit and break with gluten 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.060
 that contains the flour and is that there is a 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.100
 friend much better die some heavy 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.000
 A) Yes 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.000
 I did not know why I was already down 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.710
 finding the day is so tender 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.550
 stay rough about 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:19.260
 ten minutes more than 22 you have to 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.260
 put the money in the dough 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.650
 and you do not have to evaluate if it has to do 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.270
 if he comes back he's tense he's still called 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270
 Forget not be killing forget 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.370
 with a bag with a paper was not 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.860
 eating with a job because he has 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.620
 nice and because it was more is also 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.389
 that unites the perfect gift where then 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.160
 of double and after filling is 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.160
 because fill in think better 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.740
 we have we have them 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.060
 morones or black olive a bit of 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.060
 Ham 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.349
 with a mermaid because we are in the 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.289
 street people always ask me where 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:23.009
 is 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:25.639
 next to the outer canal alcorta pass 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.629
 the cars pass the pumpers 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:34.129
 ambulances hopefully not happened 

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:36.240
 nothing but it could also be 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:38.789
 I'm going to put on this little plate of 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.399
 possibilities a basket was where 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.710
 have in your house of aisha we put 

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:45.539
 new milestones and remember good bags 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.599
 covered that does not get air so you do not know 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:50.999
 Calla massage is seen in double days in 

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:54.749
 the place with 19 warmest you have 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:57.419
 all the time this is hot what 

00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:59.399
 I put whoever we leave it to each 

00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.860
 perfect ready would be finished and 

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:05.209
 recalled twice and now we are 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.209
 throw and start to react
