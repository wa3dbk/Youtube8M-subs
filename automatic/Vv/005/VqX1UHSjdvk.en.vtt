we are back at the house we got all the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.330 
we are back at the house we got all the
leaves<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> beautiful<00:02:38.570> beautiful

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
leaves and this is a beautiful beautiful

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.460 
leaves and this is a beautiful beautiful
bunch<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.489> compost<00:02:40.880> leaves<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.360> or<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:42.350> be

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
bunch of compost leaves here or will be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.150 
bunch of compost leaves here or will be
composted<00:02:42.800> leaves<00:02:43.120> but<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> leaves<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.870> are

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
composted leaves but the leaves here are

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.740 
composted leaves but the leaves here are
so<00:02:46.160> well<00:02:46.580> broken<00:02:46.910> down<00:02:47.150> because<00:02:47.510> whoever

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
so well broken down because whoever

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
so well broken down because whoever
mulch<00:02:48.050> them<00:02:48.320> mulch<00:02:48.950> them<00:02:49.130> up<00:02:49.220> extremely<00:02:49.640> fine

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
mulch them mulch them up extremely fine

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.640 
mulch them mulch them up extremely fine
and<00:02:50.660> that's<00:02:51.020> what<00:02:51.170> we're<00:02:51.350> looking<00:02:51.620> for

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
and that's what we're looking for

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.009 
and that's what we're looking for
because<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.360> leaf<00:02:56.510> pile<00:02:56.750> we've

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
because this is just a leaf pile we've

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.840 
because this is just a leaf pile we've
been<00:02:57.170> leaving<00:02:57.350> here<00:02:57.620> we<00:02:58.280> rake<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.580> up<00:02:58.640> this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
been leaving here we rake them up this

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.580 
been leaving here we rake them up this
fall<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.690> have<00:02:59.810> whole<00:03:00.019> leaves<00:03:00.260> like<00:03:00.410> this

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
fall and you have whole leaves like this

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.229 
fall and you have whole leaves like this
they<00:03:00.769> don't<00:03:00.860> have<00:03:01.070> much<00:03:01.250> surface<00:03:01.640> area<00:03:01.970> at<00:03:02.120> all

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
they don't have much surface area at all

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.920 
they don't have much surface area at all
so<00:03:02.930> they<00:03:03.170> don't<00:03:03.440> compost<00:03:03.920> down<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.370> much<00:03:04.549> and

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
so they don't compost down that much and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.390 
so they don't compost down that much and
air<00:03:05.930> can<00:03:06.170> get<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.410> between<00:03:06.709> them<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:06.920> they

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
air can get in between them and they

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.770 
air can get in between them and they
kind<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.820> had<00:03:07.940> tend<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.299> mat<00:03:08.510> down

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
kind of just had tend to mat down

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
kind of just had tend to mat down
because<00:03:09.680> naturally<00:03:10.610> that's<00:03:10.760> what<00:03:10.850> they're

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
because naturally that's what they're

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.280 
because naturally that's what they're
intended<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.540> when<00:03:11.690> they<00:03:11.780> fall<00:03:12.019> from<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
intended to do when they fall from the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.100 
intended to do when they fall from the
lead<00:03:12.470> when<00:03:13.040> they<00:03:13.130> fall<00:03:13.310> from<00:03:13.519> the<00:03:13.610> trees

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
lead when they fall from the trees

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.690 
lead when they fall from the trees
they're<00:03:15.110> they're<00:03:15.560> meant<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:15.799> mat<00:03:16.070> out<00:03:16.250> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
they're they're meant to mat out the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.660 
they're they're meant to mat out the
ground<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.209> they<00:03:17.360> can<00:03:18.019> kind<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.799> stomp<00:03:19.459> out

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
ground so they can kind of stomp out

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.150 
ground so they can kind of stomp out
competitors<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:20.720> grasses<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.470> small

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
competitors like grasses and small

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.920 
competitors like grasses and small
plants<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:23.030> might<00:03:23.269> steal<00:03:23.480> water<00:03:23.720> and

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
plants that might steal water and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.570 
plants that might steal water and
nutrients<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.440> next<00:03:24.680> year<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.100> they<00:03:25.220> do<00:03:25.280> that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
nutrients the next year so they do that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.320 
nutrients the next year so they do that
too<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:27.410> clear<00:03:27.709> out<00:03:27.830> the<00:03:27.950> area<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.730> kind<00:03:29.269> of

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
too to clear out the area and to kind of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.990 
too to clear out the area and to kind of
remove<00:03:29.600> away<00:03:29.840> competition<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.730> one<00:03:31.850> way

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
remove away competition so the one way

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.170 
remove away competition so the one way
to<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.720> make<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.110> compost<00:03:33.560> down<00:03:33.829> naturally<00:03:34.430> is

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
to to make it compost down naturally is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.370 
to to make it compost down naturally is
just<00:03:35.540> my<00:03:35.690> degree<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.620> surface<00:03:36.950> area<00:03:37.220> which

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
just my degree in the surface area which

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.729 
just my degree in the surface area which
God<00:03:39.380> human<00:03:40.450> mankind<00:03:41.450> has<00:03:42.049> helped<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
God human mankind has helped with that

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.160 
God human mankind has helped with that
by<00:03:43.340> creating<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.030> lawn<00:03:44.299> mower<00:03:44.570> or<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
by creating the lawn mower or the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.830 
by creating the lawn mower or the
mulching<00:03:45.709> blades<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.450> so<00:03:47.600> we<00:03:47.690> got<00:03:47.780> some

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
mulching blades and and so we got some

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.120 
mulching blades and and so we got some
great<00:03:48.049> leaves<00:03:48.350> here<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.709> are<00:03:48.769> gonna<00:03:48.860> mulch

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
great leaves here that are gonna mulch

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.479 
great leaves here that are gonna mulch
down<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:50.230> compost<00:03:51.230> down<00:03:51.350> really<00:03:51.650> quickly<00:03:51.890> so

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
down and compost down really quickly so

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.310 
down and compost down really quickly so
we<00:03:52.579> just<00:03:52.730> got<00:03:52.880> our<00:03:53.000> self<00:03:53.209> up<00:03:53.360> really<00:03:54.019> handy

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
we just got our self up really handy

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.260 
we just got our self up really handy
dandy<00:03:55.060> trailer<00:03:56.060> here<00:03:56.269> that<00:03:56.860> I

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.340

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
all that all the good composted leaves

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.980 
all that all the good composted leaves
end<00:04:09.990> up<00:04:10.170> falling<00:04:10.860> off<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.160> back<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.810> when<00:04:12.960> I

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
end up falling off the back and when I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.780 
end up falling off the back and when I
pull<00:04:13.260> forward<00:04:13.560> it'll<00:04:14.340> pretty<00:04:14.490> much<00:04:14.640> just

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
pull forward it'll pretty much just

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.270 
pull forward it'll pretty much just
leave<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.000> nice<00:04:15.180> little<00:04:15.420> brick<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.960> of<00:04:16.320> mulch

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
leave a nice little brick of of mulch

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.930 
leave a nice little brick of of mulch
leave<00:04:17.580> mine<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.180> then<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.110> will<00:04:19.580> slowly<00:04:20.580> add

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
leave mine and then we will slowly add

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.140 
leave mine and then we will slowly add
in<00:04:21.630> some<00:04:21.959> food<00:04:22.470> scraps<00:04:22.830> over<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.640> winter<00:04:23.910> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
in some food scraps over the winter and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.550 
in some food scraps over the winter and
we'll<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.480> kind<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.660> open<00:04:24.930> up<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.110> pile<00:04:25.290> add

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.260 
we'll just kind of open up the pile add
the<00:04:25.680> food<00:04:25.830> scraps<00:04:26.130> pile<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.910> back<00:04:27.090> in

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the food scraps pile it back in

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.430 
the food scraps pile it back in
sometimes<00:04:27.660> we'll<00:04:27.780> add<00:04:27.870> some<00:04:27.990> blood<00:04:28.200> meal

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
sometimes we'll add some blood meal

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.890 
sometimes we'll add some blood meal
coffee<00:04:29.430> grounds<00:04:29.880> some<00:04:30.030> nitrogen<00:04:30.360> rich<00:04:30.600> stuff

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
coffee grounds some nitrogen rich stuff

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.050 
coffee grounds some nitrogen rich stuff
to<00:04:31.110> help<00:04:31.260> boost<00:04:31.530> up<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.280> nitrogen<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.850> carbon

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
to help boost up the nitrogen to carbon

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.600
