00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.540
 Hello we appreciate 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.270
 look at the new tv from samsung 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.730
 let's see what comes outwardly 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.039
 It looks like and remind you again and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.880
 TV supported ultra hd 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.690
 permissions and he's not exactly plasma on 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.870
 years of technology so it looks like this 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.350
 frames are all the way around in 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.430
 metal frame built-in speakers 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:37.280
 power 120 is such a stand for everything 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.260
 metal respectively from the connectors 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.260
 which is built into it only one yusb 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.159
 port and this is a lotion with everyone else 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.850
 connectors 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.170
 separately connects anywhere but also 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.519
 can be put anywhere 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.889
 There are 2 yusb ports a large number of hdmi 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:00.729
 yes yes here it is the most basic wire 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:05.360
 goes and connects here court 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:08.470
 behind the back cover it is removed on 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.400
 magnets here there is a connector for flash drives 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.400
 connector for 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.330
 port so it looks like that is 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.060
 the video on it is very clear all he can 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.840
 rotate at different angles behind 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.080
 frame account 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.360
 there is also a hinge and he can ride down 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.700
 up there is a camera 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.240
 respectively by skype to talk 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.280
 gesture commands can channel 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.750
 switch volume there add 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.560
 just waving a hand 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.580
 Yes, this is how the hinge looks like in principle 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 seemingly not very reliable design 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.210
 considering the weight of the device itself 120 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 kilogram 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.160
 there is a wall mount completely 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.470
 metal so monolithic but 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.650
 a look that included Comes 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 three boxes open first in first 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.250
 coming 4 pairs of 3d points will pass 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.060
 non-standard like in all well still 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.840
 TV by the way is worth at least 300 if 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.940
 what so yes they go 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.910
 which can be charged separately and not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.690
 buy batteries so they look up 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.739
 the blocks are in the back for the battery behind 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.390
 due to this weight is almost imperceptible but 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.209
 I will not open that is because it is necessary to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.510
 the battery tube is at the back 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.599
 on the handle an additional compartment goes for 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.819
 each headphone and its own cable for 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.239
 charging but this is the usual micro yusbi 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.739
 from whitby is charged either there usually 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.900
 charge the phone take with 3 plug 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:57.290
 charges but wipes for rubbing 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:02.150
 Well, the instruction of all this useful stuff 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.670
 all sorts of paper go ahead see what 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.069
 still there is a separate course 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.420
 consider just such a cool 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:15.170
 a booklet that she put so much of 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.250
 velvet top there inside is very 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.920
 quality printed all sorts of photos 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.530
 pictures of how tv is positioned 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.120
 where it can be used but clearly from 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:35.720
 9 series as it's such a premium 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.239
 fun move on well well every here 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.709
 set of any wires 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.200
 all sorts of mounts for old adapters 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.200
 the devices here are separately 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.139
 Remote and remote control I'm a little 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.769
 at the end of the video I will tell the remote are interesting 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.519
 can do a lot 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.489
 compact 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.940
 yes he is one in the set because yes and 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:08.239
 then in the 8 series there were two remotes one ordinary 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.000
 and one show too touchscreen touchpad review 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.020
 remote sky 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.600
 that he is so literally seconds 30 top 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.630
 metal part from touches weedy 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.239
 panel like in a laptop on this 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.160
 panels you can draw a channel for example 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.150
 five painted he switches 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.960
 built-in microphone 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:32.720
 well, all the controls need 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.720
 drive smart hub 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 so cool is reminiscent of something style 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.500
 and mobile phone design in hand 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.450
 lies nicely so and behind 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.960
 side mouth button i.e. disable 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.820
 volume but that's all subscribe to 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.360
 my channel will find me on yu tuba 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.360
 see from
