00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 Matiz again Vladimir Kafanov 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.679
 today's 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.509
 In this lesson, we will discuss the tasks in 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.939
 In general, it is easy and how to replace 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.750
 air filter on all of us beloved 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.669
 deo matiz 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 let's see a little bit about why this 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.019
 the element serves and died and you can 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.780
 make sure that it is done simply 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.909
 elementary and in fact there are no 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 He does not have any difficulties 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.079
 This is how this represents 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.089
 filter element in rubber 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 both of which sits in the body 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.110
 air filter and pressed against the top 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.519
 cover everything you need to replace 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.439
 the air filter is now at 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.360
 my hand is actually new 

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:53.369
 air filter usually happens 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.530
 enough cross screwdriver nothing 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.030
 We are complex because the screws that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.269
 fix the top cover enough 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.009
 often turn sour faces on them tear me 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.839
 easier and more convenient to use the little head 

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.670
 by 8 to the most common ratchet 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's see how it's done all 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.869
 very simply turn away the key two 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.200
 the screws that secure the air cap 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200
 filter 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.520
 So there is an exciting moment 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.290
 let's look at what she drove 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.180
 our little car for the last replacement 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.710
 filter 20,000 and that scored in on 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.479
 the back of the cover is fixed by two 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.479
 hooks just enough to withdraw 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.220
 cover of them and put aside and so 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.320
 i'm holding an old air filter 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.420
 who ran 20 thousand strictly time 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.420
 defined by the regulations you yourself can 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.640
 make sure that his condition is far from 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 perfect that is all this dirt which 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.720
 sat down on his cells he didn't let in 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.880
 engine power system and your 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.400
 cylinders well and to confirm their 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.290
 words can show a little trick 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.030
 which many owners do yes 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
 they say that the filter is enough to knock out and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.080
 put back guys is complete nonsense 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.239
 this crap really because it 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.690
 direct path to killing your 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.459
 engine 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.550
 See what's in it for this 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.550
 time 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.200
 for example, we specifically took 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.390
 a car that is not washed not 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.010
 rubbed did not seek to do 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.750
 somehow cut and so on you 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.080
 see for yourself that the engine compartment 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 dusty enough all this whole rubbish 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.580
 this large dust could be 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.989
 your top hat 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.299
 frames you can see the difference between 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.549
 old filter and new with that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.459
 the filter passed only 20,000 many not 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.760
 change filters 30 and 50 and so on. good luck 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.470
 waiting for a visit for parts for kapitalki 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.829
 but we will now install the new filter all 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.040
 very simply have it wide 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.810
 part up and look to the inscription house 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.060
 located on the top was 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.810
 orientated closer to the bulkhead 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:22.080
 engine compartment just install 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:27.300
 filter in the lower part of the body 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.760
 and tightly press follow them there 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.770
 then between the top of the filter 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 and 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.380
 the air filter housing was not 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.600
 gaps gently press down on top 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.800
 top cap introduces mrs 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.240
 put in the back of the cover and 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.380
 fix those same screws that 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.380
 unscrewed before this 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.320
 and I certainly advise you to 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.730
 replacing the filter is required to inspect 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.220
 corrugated hose integrity 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.410
 which connects the throttle to the body 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.420
 air filter is very simple 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 whatever the features of the filter if we have 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.200
 there is a crack in this hose dirt 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 directly goes to the engine so 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.160
 carefully inspect especially in 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.230
 bends ready to debt and to avoid 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.020
 crack cracks cracks similar 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.640
 things we find of course we change but 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.040
 this is all right though dusty but 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.200
 replace the working filter 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.930
 work finished it took about 2 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.550
 minutes it took the usual key head 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.430
 at 8 anyone can use 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.010
 cross screwdriver change anything hard 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.060
 filters often filter matiz we always 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.760
 pay attention that it is better to do it 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.170
 sooner than later carefully thousands 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.270
 your car and you had peace 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.550

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:38.270
 five see time jumped shock 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.190
 mechanism and take well two three minutes not 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.410
 the more I assure you the conditions would 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.090
 a little 80 shoot the video again sees 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.090
