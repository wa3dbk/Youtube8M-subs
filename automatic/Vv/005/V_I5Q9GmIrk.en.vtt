00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
take less damage from voodoo dolls would

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.429 
take less damage from voodoo dolls would
be<00:02:25.430> optimal<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.150> save<00:02:26.360> healer<00:02:26.720> mana<00:02:26.930> because

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
be optimal to save healer mana because

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.190 
be optimal to save healer mana because
this<00:02:28.189> can<00:02:28.579> be<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.760> very<00:02:28.939> healer<00:02:29.329> intensified<00:02:29.989> if

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this can be a very healer intensified if

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.899 
this can be a very healer intensified if
your<00:02:30.769> spirit<00:02:31.489> world<00:02:31.790> dps<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.450> not<00:02:32.690> on<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.260> ball

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
your spirit world dps is not on the ball

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.220 
your spirit world dps is not on the ball
so<00:02:34.909> that's<00:02:35.180> pretty<00:02:35.360> much<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.629> boss<00:02:35.900> fight

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
so that's pretty much the boss fight

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.530 
so that's pretty much the boss fight
downing<00:02:36.829> shadowy<00:02:37.280> minions<00:02:37.700> down<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.329> sever
