00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's a little section that says

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.479 
doesn't have anything attached but
that's<00:02:50.470> good<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.830> know<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.250> there<00:02:51.459> are

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
that's good to know that there are

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.759 
that's good to know that there are
different<00:02:51.910> attachments<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.590> have

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
for your weapon I assume they're going

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.320 
for your weapon I assume they're going
to<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.600> similar<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.019> your<00:02:56.860> typical

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
to be similar to your typical

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.990 
to be similar to your typical
attachments<00:02:58.330> in<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.569> typical<00:02:59.080> shooter

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
attachments in a typical shooter

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.080 
attachments in a typical shooter
extended<00:03:01.000> clip<00:03:01.030> maybe<00:03:02.579> fast<00:03:03.579> reload<00:03:06.090> metal

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
extended clip maybe fast reload metal

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.640 
extended clip maybe fast reload metal
piercing<00:03:07.329> bullets<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.959> don't<00:03:08.170> know<00:03:08.290> something

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
piercing bullets I don't know something

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.850 
piercing bullets I don't know something
along<00:03:09.280> those<00:03:09.430> lines<00:03:09.900> there's<00:03:10.900> also<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.380> section

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
along those lines there's also a section

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.220 
along those lines there's also a section
that<00:03:12.130> says<00:03:12.190> mod<00:03:12.760> I<00:03:12.790> guess<00:03:13.329> mod<00:03:13.660> being<00:03:13.989> short

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
that says mod I guess mod being short

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.440 
that says mod I guess mod being short
for<00:03:14.440> modification<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.150> looks<00:03:16.390> like

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
for modification so it looks like

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.750 
for modification so it looks like
there's<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.810> lot<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.110> like<00:03:17.579> customization<00:03:18.579> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
there's a lot of like customization and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.979 
there's a lot of like customization and
modification<00:03:19.510> that's<00:03:19.660> going<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.870> be

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
modification that's going to be

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.530 
modification that's going to be
available<00:03:20.769> for<00:03:21.340> your<00:03:21.430> primary<00:03:21.880> weapon<00:03:22.299> I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
available for your primary weapon I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.900 
available for your primary weapon I
guess<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.989> make<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.350> more<00:03:23.950> unique<00:03:24.489> to<00:03:24.760> your

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
guess to make it more unique to your

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.560 
guess to make it more unique to your
price<00:03:25.350> more<00:03:26.350> unique<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.890> your<00:03:26.980> play<00:03:27.280> style<00:03:27.609> so

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
price more unique to your play style so

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.750 
price more unique to your play style so
next<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:29.170> have<00:03:29.320> electric<00:03:29.980> smoke<00:03:30.250> which<00:03:30.549> is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
next we have electric smoke which is

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.729 
next we have electric smoke which is
probably<00:03:31.269> one<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.870> cooler<00:03:32.290> things<00:03:32.560> that

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
probably one of the cooler things that

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.479 
probably one of the cooler things that
I've<00:03:32.859> seen<00:03:33.130> um<00:03:33.420> once<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.660> throw<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.500> emits

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
I've seen um once you throw it it emits

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.810 
I've seen um once you throw it it emits
a<00:03:36.700> smoke<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.739> basically<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:39.459> sort<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
a smoke and basically it sort of

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.420 
a smoke and basically it sort of
confuses<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.900> enemy<00:03:41.260> Titan<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.980> makes<00:03:42.250> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
confuses the enemy Titan and makes it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.130 
confuses the enemy Titan and makes it
hard<00:03:42.670> for<00:03:42.730> them<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.030> see<00:03:43.390> makes<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> hard<00:03:44.109> for

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
hard for them to see makes it hard for

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.770 
hard for them to see makes it hard for
them<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.440> move<00:03:44.829> so<00:03:45.579> if<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.090> play<00:03:46.390> call<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.660> duty

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
them to move so if you play call of duty

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.199 
them to move so if you play call of duty
it's<00:03:47.140> very<00:03:47.470> much<00:03:47.680> like<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:48.010> concussion<00:03:48.519> grenade

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it's very much like a concussion grenade

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.500 
it's very much like a concussion grenade
um<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:50.440> wish<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.070> played<00:03:51.370> more<00:03:51.670> games<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.359> I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
um I wish I played more games so that I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.750 
um I wish I played more games so that I
could<00:03:52.600> tell<00:03:53.320> you<00:03:53.440> guys<00:03:53.470> more<00:03:53.950> about<00:03:54.310> what

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
could tell you guys more about what

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.530 
could tell you guys more about what
other

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
other

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.880 
other
games<00:03:55.659> have<00:03:55.989> alternatives<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:58.890> I'm

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
games have alternatives to this but I'm

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.160 
games have alternatives to this but I'm
mostly<00:04:00.519> quoting<00:04:01.329> call<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.689> duty<00:04:01.989> because

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
mostly quoting call of duty because

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.440 
mostly quoting call of duty because
that's<00:04:02.709> probably<00:04:03.219> the<00:04:03.909> game<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.329> I've

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
that's probably the game that I've

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.709 
that's probably the game that I've
played<00:04:04.719> the<00:04:04.900> most<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:05.760> once<00:04:06.760> titanfall<00:04:07.150> comes

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
played the most but once titanfall comes

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.869 
played the most but once titanfall comes
out<00:04:07.900> there<00:04:08.739> will<00:04:08.829> be<00:04:08.920> less<00:04:09.250> call<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.640> duty

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
out there will be less call of duty

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.539 
out there will be less call of duty
playing<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.480> more<00:04:10.689> giant<00:04:11.200> robot<00:04:11.560> plane<00:04:11.859> which

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
playing and more giant robot plane which

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.800 
playing and more giant robot plane which
I<00:04:12.790> like<00:04:13.060> very<00:04:13.090> much<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:14.170> third<00:04:15.159> thing<00:04:15.489> is

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
I like very much and third thing is

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.080 
I like very much and third thing is
cluster<00:04:16.810> rockets<00:04:17.199> so<00:04:17.530> basically<00:04:18.190> they're

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
cluster rockets so basically they're

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.990 
cluster rockets so basically they're
sort<00:04:19.479> of<00:04:19.570> like<00:04:19.630> almost<00:04:20.590> like<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:20.859> sidearm<00:04:21.280> for

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
sort of like almost like a sidearm for

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.270 
sort of like almost like a sidearm for
your<00:04:22.180> Titan<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.780> guess<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:23.259> your<00:04:23.680> Titan<00:04:23.979> doesn't

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
your Titan I guess if your Titan doesn't

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.969 
your Titan I guess if your Titan doesn't
have<00:04:24.570> enough<00:04:25.570> time<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.870> reload<00:04:26.500> its<00:04:26.680> primary

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
have enough time to reload its primary

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.240 
have enough time to reload its primary
weapon<00:04:27.520> again<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.270> shoot<00:04:28.570> some<00:04:29.250> questions

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
weapon again just shoot some questions

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.390 
weapon again just shoot some questions
in<00:04:30.400> your<00:04:30.430> enemy's<00:04:30.940> face<00:04:31.180> really<00:04:31.539> quick<00:04:31.840> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
in your enemy's face really quick and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.010 
in your enemy's face really quick and
sort<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.580> get<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.240> out<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.389> a<00:04:34.539> tight<00:04:34.570> situation

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
sort of get you out of a tight situation

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.710 
sort of get you out of a tight situation
I<00:04:35.620> think<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:35.979> really<00:04:36.099> could<00:04:36.220> or<00:04:36.940> maybe<00:04:37.389> there's

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I think it really could or maybe there's

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.310 
I think it really could or maybe there's
some<00:04:37.900> pilots<00:04:39.419> running<00:04:40.419> around<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> walls

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
some pilots running around on the walls

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.650 
some pilots running around on the walls
or<00:04:41.710> double<00:04:42.070> jumping<00:04:42.400> all<00:04:42.550> over<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.849> place<00:04:42.940> you

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
or double jumping all over the place you

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.860 
or double jumping all over the place you
just<00:04:43.960> can't<00:04:44.440> really<00:04:44.830> get<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.009> good<00:04:45.190> aim<00:04:45.370> on<00:04:45.580> them

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
just can't really get a good aim on them

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.200 
just can't really get a good aim on them
maybe<00:04:46.870> your<00:04:47.139> cluster<00:04:47.410> rockets<00:04:47.979> can<00:04:48.190> be<00:04:48.970> a<00:04:49.000> good

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
maybe your cluster rockets can be a good

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.839 
maybe your cluster rockets can be a good
answer<00:04:49.449> for<00:04:49.599> that<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.860> think<00:04:50.979> that's<00:04:51.580> really

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
answer for that so I think that's really

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.730 
answer for that so I think that's really
cool<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.750> there's<00:04:53.320> probably<00:04:53.560> going<00:04:53.680> to

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
cool and that there's probably going to

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.409 
cool and that there's probably going to
be<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.919> ton<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.250> different<00:04:54.520> ways<00:04:54.849> that<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.180> can

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
be a ton of different ways that you can

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.080 
be a ton of different ways that you can
use<00:04:55.630> them<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.560> only<00:04:57.099> time<00:04:57.280> will<00:04:57.340> tell<00:04:57.550> we'll

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
use them so only time will tell we'll

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.129 
use them so only time will tell we'll
have<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.300> wait<00:04:58.419> until<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.780> game<00:04:58.960> actually

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
have to wait until the game actually

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.029 
have to wait until the game actually
comes<00:04:59.530> out<00:04:59.740> and<00:05:00.630> our<00:05:01.630> final<00:05:01.960> Titan<00:05:02.590> is<00:05:02.800> the

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
comes out and our final Titan is the

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.760 
comes out and our final Titan is the
high<00:05:03.310> explosives<00:05:04.240> tighten<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:05.199> Titan<00:05:05.590> is

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
high explosives tighten this Titan is

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
high explosives tighten this Titan is
virtually<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.699> same<00:05:06.729> as<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.330> heavy<00:05:07.539> weapons

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
virtually the same as the heavy weapons

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.070 
virtually the same as the heavy weapons
Titan<00:05:08.470> except<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.550> has<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:10.210> Titan<00:05:10.810> rocket

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
Titan except it has the Titan rocket

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.760 
Titan except it has the Titan rocket
launcher<00:05:11.880> once<00:05:12.880> again<00:05:13.030> no<00:05:13.840> attachments<00:05:14.620> no

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.719 
launcher once again no attachments no
modifications<00:05:16.500> no<00:05:17.500> telling<00:05:17.979> what<00:05:18.250> kind<00:05:18.550> of

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
modifications no telling what kind of

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.670 
modifications no telling what kind of
modifications<00:05:19.300> or<00:05:19.870> attachments<00:05:20.470> are<00:05:20.560> going

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
modifications or attachments are going

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.339 
modifications or attachments are going
to<00:05:20.740> be<00:05:20.860> available<00:05:21.520> once<00:05:22.449> the<00:05:22.690> full<00:05:22.930> game<00:05:23.139> is

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
to be available once the full game is

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.529 
to be available once the full game is
released<00:05:23.560> I<00:05:23.979> think<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.400> reason<00:05:24.580> why<00:05:24.909> a<00:05:25.270> lot<00:05:25.330> of

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
released I think the reason why a lot of

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.649 
released I think the reason why a lot of
these<00:05:25.720> default<00:05:26.500> classes<00:05:26.979> don't<00:05:27.159> have

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
these default classes don't have

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.820 
these default classes don't have
attachments<00:05:28.659> or<00:05:28.720> modifications<00:05:29.440> is<00:05:29.590> just

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
attachments or modifications is just

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.279 
attachments or modifications is just
because<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.760> game<00:05:30.970> is<00:05:31.240> still<00:05:31.449> very<00:05:31.810> much<00:05:32.080> in

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
because the game is still very much in

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.119 
because the game is still very much in
development

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
development

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.999 
development
and<00:05:33.809> they're<00:05:34.809> so<00:05:35.080> coming<00:05:35.379> up<00:05:35.439> with<00:05:35.559> ideas<00:05:35.589> and

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
and they're so coming up with ideas and

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.139 
and they're so coming up with ideas and
just<00:05:36.699> different<00:05:36.939> things<00:05:37.209> to<00:05:37.719> you<00:05:38.199> know<00:05:38.939> put<00:05:39.939> in

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149 
just different things to you know put in

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.119 
just different things to you know put in
the<00:05:40.300> game<00:05:40.509> I<00:05:40.749> guess<00:05:40.929> different<00:05:41.349> balancing

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
the game I guess different balancing

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.320 
the game I guess different balancing
things<00:05:42.759> are<00:05:42.999> all<00:05:43.959> that<00:05:44.289> stuff<00:05:45.149> so<00:05:46.149> they've

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
things are all that stuff so they've

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.629 
things are all that stuff so they've
been<00:05:46.509> working<00:05:46.809> on<00:05:46.899> this<00:05:47.019> game<00:05:47.259> for<00:05:47.589> probably<00:05:48.189> I

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
been working on this game for probably I

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.839 
been working on this game for probably I
don't<00:05:48.849> know<00:05:49.119> maybe<00:05:50.019> three<00:05:50.739> or<00:05:50.769> four<00:05:51.369> years<00:05:51.669> now

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
don't know maybe three or four years now

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.809 
don't know maybe three or four years now
so<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:52.689> mean<00:05:53.199> I<00:05:53.439> like<00:05:53.889> that<00:05:54.159> they're<00:05:54.339> taking<00:05:54.519> the

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
so I mean I like that they're taking the

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.019 
so I mean I like that they're taking the
extra<00:05:55.149> year<00:05:55.599> to<00:05:55.809> sort<00:05:56.619> of<00:05:56.769> get<00:05:57.459> everything

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
extra year to sort of get everything

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.540 
extra year to sort of get everything
done<00:05:58.300> so<00:05:58.659> that<00:05:58.809> we<00:05:58.839> can<00:05:59.019> have<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.439> polished<00:06:00.219> game

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
done so that we can have a polished game

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.419 
done so that we can have a polished game
and<00:06:00.909> not<00:06:00.999> just<00:06:01.300> like<00:06:01.599> a<00:06:01.929> turd<00:06:02.559> sandwich<00:06:02.949> that's

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:03.429 
and not just like a turd sandwich that's

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:06.019 
and not just like a turd sandwich that's
just<00:06:03.759> sort<00:06:03.999> of<00:06:04.089> cut<00:06:04.389> and<00:06:04.539> dry<00:06:04.839> and<00:06:05.229> just

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
just sort of cut and dry and just

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.809 
just sort of cut and dry and just
unbalanced<00:06:07.029> not<00:06:07.419> very<00:06:07.779> good<00:06:08.559> game<00:06:08.919> I<00:06:09.249> think

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
unbalanced not very good game I think

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.809 
unbalanced not very good game I think
titanfall<00:06:10.059> is<00:06:10.360> going<00:06:10.509> to<00:06:10.569> be<00:06:10.749> a<00:06:11.610> pretty<00:06:12.610> damn

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
titanfall is going to be a pretty damn

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.869 
titanfall is going to be a pretty damn
good<00:06:12.879> game<00:06:13.179> if<00:06:13.779> I<00:06:13.869> can<00:06:14.050> say<00:06:14.199> so<00:06:14.259> myself<00:06:14.879> but

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
good game if I can say so myself but

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.519 
good game if I can say so myself but
I've<00:06:16.059> been<00:06:16.300> talking<00:06:16.809> a<00:06:16.869> lot<00:06:16.990> about<00:06:17.050> that

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:17.529 
I've been talking a lot about that

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.290 
I've been talking a lot about that
haven't<00:06:18.099> been<00:06:18.159> talking<00:06:18.550> much<00:06:18.580> about<00:06:18.849> the

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
haven't been talking much about the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.199 
haven't been talking much about the
actual<00:06:19.599> rocket<00:06:19.959> launcher<00:06:20.499> it's<00:06:21.459> a<00:06:21.699> rocket

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.209 
actual rocket launcher it's a rocket

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:25.049 
actual rocket launcher it's a rocket
launcher<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:23.019> has<00:06:23.469> a<00:06:23.499> four<00:06:24.099> round<00:06:24.399> burst<00:06:24.759> it

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:25.059 
launcher that has a four round burst it

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.359 
launcher that has a four round burst it
shoots<00:06:25.300> four<00:06:25.689> rockets<00:06:26.199> at<00:06:26.349> once<00:06:26.589> so<00:06:27.339> that

00:06:27.359 --> 00:06:27.369 
shoots four rockets at once so that

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.759 
shoots four rockets at once so that
could<00:06:27.939> be<00:06:28.059> very<00:06:28.089> useful<00:06:28.749> for<00:06:29.169> taking<00:06:29.649> out

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:29.769 
could be very useful for taking out

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.229 
could be very useful for taking out
other<00:06:30.039> Titans<00:06:30.779> or<00:06:31.779> just<00:06:32.379> completely

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.239 
other Titans or just completely

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:36.449 
other Titans or just completely
obliterating<00:06:34.289> pilots<00:06:35.289> well<00:06:35.919> I<00:06:35.949> don't<00:06:36.189> know<00:06:36.369> I

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:36.459 
obliterating pilots well I don't know I

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.189 
obliterating pilots well I don't know I
think<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.879> depends<00:06:37.209> I<00:06:37.449> think<00:06:37.689> it's<00:06:37.839> actually

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
think it depends I think it's actually

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.459 
think it depends I think it's actually
pretty<00:06:38.589> balanced<00:06:39.129> because<00:06:39.279> the<00:06:40.289> pilots<00:06:41.289> will

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469 
pretty balanced because the pilots will

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.009 
pretty balanced because the pilots will
be<00:06:41.679> able<00:06:41.769> to<00:06:42.009> sort<00:06:42.249> of<00:06:42.309> jump<00:06:42.639> around<00:06:42.999> and<00:06:43.329> evade

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:44.019 
be able to sort of jump around and evade

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:48.109 
be able to sort of jump around and evade
the<00:06:44.229> Rockets<00:06:44.709> where<00:06:44.919> is<00:06:45.129> a<00:06:45.399> full<00:06:45.849> a<00:06:46.269> full<00:06:46.599> Titan

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:48.119 
the Rockets where is a full a full Titan

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.759 
the Rockets where is a full a full Titan
has<00:06:49.119> no<00:06:49.360> choice<00:06:49.569> but<00:06:49.629> to<00:06:49.990> just<00:06:50.169> sit<00:06:50.379> there<00:06:50.589> and

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:50.769 
has no choice but to just sit there and

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:53.969 
has no choice but to just sit there and
get<00:06:50.979> hit<00:06:51.339> by<00:06:51.369> them<00:06:51.909> so<00:06:52.389> I<00:06:52.689> don't<00:06:53.379> know<00:06:53.529> that's

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
get hit by them so I don't know that's

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.219 
get hit by them so I don't know that's
what<00:06:54.159> I<00:06:54.189> think<00:06:54.309> um<00:06:54.819> so<00:06:55.629> that's<00:06:55.839> what's<00:06:56.079> been

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
what I think um so that's what's been

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.600 
what I think um so that's what's been
released<00:06:56.619> about<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:57.009> different<00:06:57.339> Titan

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
released about the different Titan

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.850 
released about the different Titan

classes so far tell me what you guys

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.739 
classes so far tell me what you guys
