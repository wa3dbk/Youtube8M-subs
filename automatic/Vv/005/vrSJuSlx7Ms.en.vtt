00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.850
 so keep the next player ruby ​​and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.530
 wilfried bony is man of the today 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.590
 match has an 82 year old doing 74 76 85 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.210
 shoulder 1 60 fits and 88 physics medium 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.670
 small working space right foot prescribed 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.910
 fast skipper costs even 360 km 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.220
 for four play four goals achieved 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.650
 and a goal master gave it before 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.210
 okay i say my net is him 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.890
 not good you have to say something in protection 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 Of course we understand the strength we understand 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 not said but 790 strength 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.250
 in the ingame scenes at the very first 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.660
 positive point and that is the type 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 Simply monster the pressure 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.469
 fed every defender away and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.239
 we do not shove it around so easily 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 his room wants to shake her 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 simply prepare cupboard and it is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 very helpful in fighting if 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.219
 So you just have a monster to do so 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.579
 The firepower is also extremely often with 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.039
 93 and he shoots the offender sometimes 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.199
 just fine the ball around the ears head 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 balloon just jump steel the precision 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.289
 city ​​also has two kopftoren 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.899
 made 1 not show because again 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.680
 times saved by default 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.270
 Control is okay too if you have the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.170
 sprinter if you go in germany 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.380
 is the lama that relives at conversion that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 I think I have no idea but that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.369
 is really already if you are relaxed 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.229
 then, meanwhile, twice as fast 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 bonuses led 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.930
 The pace was okay if he was positive 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 still negative but just completely 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.409
 good with life and the forest is too 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 quite so that a left foot is too 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.189
 I use it quite well 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 times negative in any case he is like that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.670
 immobile like a stone, not even 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 there you are, you do not want to compare it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.299
 says already but it just does 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 agility real like a blade of grass without 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.259
 any countries on this world it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.659
 is just to compare with what belongs 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.920
 simply it's just extremely difficult 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.500
 A goal to set at least something for 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.439
 me so he's 286 positioning and possible 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.400
 working is quite ok to indie 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.840
 scene set 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.160
 partly not really made so with 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.870
 Of course, flanks are very clear but 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.850
 otherwise out of the game is already 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.590
 really not so easy and dreispitz 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.470
 So of course he has a good idea 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.030
 it would have been better but his 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.130
 I would not have believed treatment either 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.050
 saved a lot and have to tell me 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.640
 personal harmony had not fallen 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.500
 just not my player type it is one 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 little contributor because then you are right 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.970
 not really somehow would be one 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.830
 to bring good position and be 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.240
 Completing his 83 also quite okay neither 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.270
 Positive still negative singing is for 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.100
 So I stayed in the 75 of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.780
 ten down side the top of my 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.650
 personal opinion so far with me 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.330
 believe there could be one or 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.660
 other flanks can play well ok 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.980
 his 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.170
 instead of just bonuses in the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.280
 comments and is again a link in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.970
 The description workshop comes over 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 the next play offs
