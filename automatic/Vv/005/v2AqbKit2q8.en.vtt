 will be automatically named alpha 1 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.109
 the best thing at this point would be and rename the channel with a name to 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.499
 your choice so as not to confuse it if you were to create others 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.630
 do not be frightened if at this point you see all black click in the

 arrow to find your photo 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 your photo is now all red because when you create an alpha channel 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.170
 clear and marked in red are those selected by default throughout the photo and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.290
 you can work on this new channel with the tires on it 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.270

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.610
 to you, however, would also have the part in front of a subject out of focus and not 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.270
 only the one in the background 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.370
 go to the top bar settings and the normal mode is changed 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.120
 to discolor 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.049
 Now go with your shade on the center of the flower 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.810
 drag mauser to the base of the flower 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.329
 via open your selected fire plan at this point but you have to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.360
 select more precisely subject himself 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.990
 just select a panel not too hard to draw on it 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.690
 as you see in the channel in correspondence with the fool the outline in black a 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.800
 indicate that that area is completely selected 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.969
 click on the eye next to the water lily channel 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.650
 and select the rgb channel to return to work on the image 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.260
 a filter you will use is the lens blur filter 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.980
 a window will open in which a preview of your will appear 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.470
 completely out of focus image selected from the source drop down menu 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.150
 your water lily level will prevent your skin from reappearing in the preview 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.039
 subject in all its sharpness 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:22.429
 play with the blur radius value to decide how much you want that 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:26.019
