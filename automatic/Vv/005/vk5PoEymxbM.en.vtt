bang and it's gotta hit some more manual

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.730 
bang and it's gotta hit some more manual
pads<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.770> back<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:07.050> ground<00:03:07.320> here<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:07.709> a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
pads in the back the ground here is a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
pads in the back the ground here is a
little<00:03:08.100> weird<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.880> works<00:03:19.489> then<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.640> got

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
little weird but it works then it's got

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.610 
little weird but it works then it's got
this<00:03:20.940> long<00:03:21.239> metal<00:03:21.750> ledge<00:03:24.020> which<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.260> kind<00:03:25.500> of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
this long metal ledge which is kind of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.660 
this long metal ledge which is kind of
deadly<00:03:27.440> because<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.739> double-sided<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.550> you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
deadly because it's double-sided and you

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.460 
deadly because it's double-sided and you
can<00:03:29.850> flip<00:03:30.180> over<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.870> thing<00:03:34.050> about<00:03:34.080> this

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
can flip over so the thing about this

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.060 
can flip over so the thing about this
spot<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.300> your<00:03:36.300> average<00:03:36.900> person<00:03:37.260> would<00:03:37.709> would

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
spot is your average person would would

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.940 
spot is your average person would would
roll<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.550> here<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:38.880> not<00:03:39.360> think<00:03:40.350> anything<00:03:40.830> of

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
roll in here and not think anything of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.130 
roll in here and not think anything of
it<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> idea<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.750> got<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.930> kind

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
it but the idea is that you got to kind

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.050 
it but the idea is that you got to kind
of<00:03:43.290> think<00:03:43.620> differently<00:03:44.160> try<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.700> think<00:03:44.850> like

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
of think differently try and think like

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.420 
of think differently try and think like
a<00:03:45.090> skater<00:03:45.480> try<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.380> look<00:03:46.530> at<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.250> can

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
a skater try and look at like what can

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.699 
a skater try and look at like what can
we<00:03:47.610> skate<00:03:47.910> here<00:03:48.299> because<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> lot<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.500> those

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
we skate here because a lot of those

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.350 
we skate here because a lot of those
obstacles<00:03:49.980> back<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.580> they're<00:03:50.850> weird<00:03:51.120> you

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
obstacles back there they're weird you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.720 
obstacles back there they're weird you
have<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.600> get<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:52.040> really<00:03:53.040> creative<00:03:53.459> to
