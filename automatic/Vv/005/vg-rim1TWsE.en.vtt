24-bit file 192 you know it is helps you
adjust<00:01:06.409> your<00:01:06.770> software<00:01:07.369> because<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> lot<00:01:07.970> of

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
adjust your software because a lot of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.550 
adjust your software because a lot of

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
going to do all kinds of things so our

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.569 
going to do all kinds of things so our
24<00:01:13.880> 192<00:01:14.479> might<00:01:14.720> get<00:01:14.869> down<00:01:15.020> sampled<00:01:15.500> 244<00:01:16.070> 1<00:01:16.280> and

digital<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.610> brought<00:02:43.819> this<00:02:44.000> unit<00:02:44.329> out<00:02:44.420> and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
digital so we brought this unit out and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.229 
digital so we brought this unit out and
it<00:02:44.989> sells<00:02:45.200> for<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.410> little<00:02:45.650> bit<00:02:45.739> less<00:02:46.239> starting

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
it sells for a little bit less starting

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.300 
it sells for a little bit less starting
over<00:02:47.359> over<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.019> these<00:02:48.440> are<00:02:48.500> our<00:02:48.620> outputs<00:02:49.130> we

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
over over here these are our outputs we

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.880 
over over here these are our outputs we

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
have three sets of analog outputs you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.870 
have three sets of analog outputs you
wouldn't<00:02:52.190> find<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.519> on<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> regular

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
wouldn't find this on a regular

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.670 
wouldn't find this on a regular
preamplifier<00:02:53.720> usually<00:02:54.079> at<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> most<00:02:54.440> you'll

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
preamplifier usually at the most you'll

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.490 
preamplifier usually at the most you'll
find<00:02:54.890> two<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.060> two<00:02:56.269> sets<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.720> unbalanced

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
find two we have two sets of unbalanced

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.729 
find two we have two sets of unbalanced
and<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.709> have<00:02:57.829> one<00:02:57.980> set<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.400> balanced<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.470> then

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
and we have one set of balanced and then

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.770 
and we have one set of balanced and then
as<00:03:00.859> far<00:03:01.040> as<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.370> inputs<00:03:01.819> we<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.120> two<00:03:02.329> sets<00:03:02.630> of

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
as far as the inputs we have two sets of

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.539 
as far as the inputs we have two sets of
stereo<00:03:03.139> inputs<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:03.739> analog<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.430> you're

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
stereo inputs for analog so if you're

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.729 
stereo inputs for analog so if you're
playing<00:03:04.790> an<00:03:05.030> FM<00:03:05.329> tuner<00:03:05.810> or<00:03:05.989> if<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> want<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
playing an FM tuner or if you want to

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.680 
playing an FM tuner or if you want to
incorporate<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.130> turntable<00:03:07.639> in<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.540> can

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
incorporate a turntable in this you can

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.840 
incorporate a turntable in this you can
also<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:09.139> that<00:03:09.489> coming<00:03:10.489> from<00:03:10.579> a<00:03:10.670> phone<00:03:10.819> a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
also do that coming from a phone a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.199 
also do that coming from a phone a
preamp<00:03:11.269> stage<00:03:11.889> to<00:03:12.889> coax<00:03:13.250> digital<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.819> to

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
preamp stage to coax digital in to

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.890 
preamp stage to coax digital in to
optical<00:03:14.660> in<00:03:14.840> USB<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.100> 12-volt<00:03:17.090> trigger<00:03:17.450> so

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
optical in USB and 12-volt trigger so

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.319 
optical in USB and 12-volt trigger so
now<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.470> use<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.519> start<00:03:20.120> up<00:03:20.209> an

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
now you can use this to start up an

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.849 
now you can use this to start up an
amplifier<00:03:20.750> or<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.049> rest<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.350> your<00:03:21.470> system<00:03:21.769> it

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
amplifier or the rest of your system it

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.129 
amplifier or the rest of your system it
will<00:03:21.920> power<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.579> power<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.850> down<00:03:23.139> going

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
will power it up and power it down going

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.500 
will power it up and power it down going
up<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> deck<00:03:24.799> 2d<00:03:25.250> as<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:26.060> said<00:03:26.299> we've

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
dropped the analog inputs we've also

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.180 
dropped the analog inputs we've also
dropped<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.940> 12-volt<00:03:29.359> trigger<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.709> DAC<00:03:30.950> tune

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
dropped the 12-volt trigger the DAC tune

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.059 
dropped the 12-volt trigger the DAC tune
