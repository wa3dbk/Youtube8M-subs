00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
out and that's the question of our video

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.899 
out and that's the question of our video
games<00:01:34.860> art<00:01:35.479> now<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> thorny<00:01:37.290> issue<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
games art now this is a thorny issue and

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
games art now this is a thorny issue and
the<00:01:38.909> problem<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.540> both<00:01:39.930> sides<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the problem is is that both sides of the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.100 
the problem is is that both sides of the
argument<00:01:40.619> are<00:01:41.040> essentially<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.930> both

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
argument are essentially right but both

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.580 
argument are essentially right but both
sides<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.470> also<00:01:43.649> essentially<00:01:44.520> wrong<00:01:45.590> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
sides are also essentially wrong the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.630 
sides are also essentially wrong the
thing<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.159> were<00:01:47.280> talking<00:01:47.549> about

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
thing is a lot we were talking about

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
thing is a lot we were talking about
games<00:01:48.180> are<00:01:48.360> going<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.810> then<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.290> must

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
