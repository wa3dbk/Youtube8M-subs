00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.240 
especially I thought the first off was
better<00:01:34.650> than<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> second<00:01:35.430> um<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.220> I

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
one or two half chances that came across

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
penalty area he could have gotten on the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.820 
penalty area he could have gotten on the
end<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:40.080> yeah<00:02:41.400> hmm<00:02:42.960> do<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.020> think<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.710> this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
end of yeah hmm do you think that this

is an issue I mean do you think are you

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.870 
is an issue I mean do you think are you
watching<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.980> game<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.340> thinking<00:02:48.640> we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
watching the game and thinking we

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.290 
watching the game and thinking we
definitely<00:02:49.480> do<00:02:49.870> need<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.700> bonafide<00:02:51.700> strike

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
definitely do need and a bonafide strike

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.750 
definitely do need and a bonafide strike
yes<00:02:53.430> yes<00:02:55.170> yes<00:02:56.170> despite<00:02:56.860> having<00:02:57.100> Alexis

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
yes yes yes despite having Alexis

yes yes yes despite having Alexis
Sanchez<00:02:58.480> yes<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.650> don't<00:03:00.250> think<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.970> need

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
Sanchez yes I don't think the the need

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.080 
Sanchez yes I don't think the the need
is<00:03:01.510> quite<00:03:02.200> quite<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.190> pressing<00:03:03.670> as<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.910> was

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
is quite quite as pressing as it was

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.720 
is quite quite as pressing as it was
last<00:03:04.300> season<00:03:04.630> when<00:03:04.960> we<00:03:05.020> didn't<00:03:05.470> have<00:03:05.730> Sanchez

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
last season when we didn't have Sanchez

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.890 
last season when we didn't have Sanchez
playing<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.390> us<00:03:08.820> because<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:10.060> think<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.660> time

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
playing for us because I think in time

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.250 
playing for us because I think in time
Sanchez<00:03:11.860> will<00:03:12.100> get<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> few<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.420> few<00:03:13.540> goals<00:03:13.930> for

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
Sanchez will get a few a few goals for

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.630 
Sanchez will get a few a few goals for
us<00:03:14.440> yeah<00:03:16.530> but<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> think<00:03:17.740> yes<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.310> think<00:03:18.340> that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
us yeah but I think yes I think that

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.990 
us yeah but I think yes I think that
that<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.200> an<00:03:20.380> issue<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:21.310> is<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.970> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
that that is an issue it is it is a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.290 
that that is an issue it is it is a
weakness<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:23.230> know<00:03:23.410> in<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.860> game<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:25.030> mean

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
weakness you know in a game I mean

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.460 
weakness you know in a game I mean
Sanchez<00:03:25.690> obviously<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.110> going<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.290> take<00:03:26.440> a

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
Sanchez obviously is going to take a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.770 
Sanchez obviously is going to take a
while<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.920> bed<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.280> isn't<00:03:27.610> he<00:03:27.730> yes<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.510> lot<00:03:28.630> of
