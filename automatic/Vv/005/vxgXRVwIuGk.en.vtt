00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:30.969 
pasture it always had been a pasture but

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:32.159 
pasture it always had been a pasture but
we<00:00:31.180> came<00:00:31.329> through<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.750> took<00:00:31.899> out<00:00:32.050> the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
we came through and we took out the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.290 
we came through and we took out the
fence<00:00:32.380> line<00:00:32.619> which<00:00:32.920> was<00:00:33.129> like<00:00:33.430> right<00:00:34.030> along

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
fence line which was like right along

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.040 
fence line which was like right along
that<00:00:34.540> grass<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:35.410> see<00:00:35.620> there<00:00:36.690> took<00:00:37.690> out<00:00:37.870> that

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
that grass you see there took out that

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.959 
that grass you see there took out that
fence<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.280> going<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.460> be<00:00:39.579> turning<00:00:39.820> the

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
fence and it's going to be turning the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.410 
fence and it's going to be turning the
corn<00:00:40.180> this<00:00:40.360> year<00:00:40.570> last<00:00:41.170> year<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.829> I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:43.329> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
corn this year last year and I think the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.420 
corn this year last year and I think the
year<00:00:43.540> before<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:43.840> we<00:00:44.170> harvested<00:00:44.650> it<00:00:44.800> for<00:00:45.070> the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
year before that we harvested it for the

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.640 
year before that we harvested it for the
grass<00:00:45.640> off<00:00:45.970> of<00:00:46.150> it<00:00:46.270> and<00:00:46.870> before<00:00:46.990> that<00:00:47.320> we<00:00:47.470> had

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
grass off of it and before that we had

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.319 
grass off of it and before that we had
cows<00:00:48.340> in<00:00:48.550> here<00:00:48.579> but<00:00:48.910> there<00:00:49.060> aren't<00:00:49.150> gonna<00:00:49.270> be

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
cows in here but there aren't gonna be

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.510 
cows in here but there aren't gonna be
any<00:00:49.450> cows<00:00:49.750> up<00:00:50.020> in<00:00:50.200> this<00:00:50.770> part<00:00:51.010> any<00:00:51.160> longer

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
any cows up in this part any longer

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.100 
any cows up in this part any longer
we're<00:00:52.000> hoping<00:00:52.210> we<00:00:52.329> can<00:00:52.360> farm<00:00:52.690> more<00:00:52.930> that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
we're hoping we can farm more that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.580 
we're hoping we can farm more that
hillside<00:00:53.530> over<00:00:53.739> there<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.720> future<00:00:55.840> but

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
hillside over there in the future but

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.740 
hillside over there in the future but
this<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.950> just<00:00:57.100> what<00:00:57.280> we're<00:00:57.399> doing<00:00:57.550> now<00:00:57.700> and<00:00:57.910> my

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.490 
probably won't be able to at this farm
completely<00:01:15.820> done<00:01:16.000> today<00:01:16.120> but<00:01:17.080> since<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.380> don't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
completely done today but since we don't

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.810 
completely done today but since we don't
have<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.650> stop<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.040> fill<00:01:18.220> up<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.400> fertilizer

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
have to stop to fill up the fertilizer

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.060 
have to stop to fill up the fertilizer
boxes<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:20.110> should<00:01:20.320> be<00:01:20.409> able<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.590> get<00:01:20.680> more<00:01:21.010> than

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
boxes we should be able to get more than

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.680 
boxes we should be able to get more than
we'd<00:01:21.430> typically<00:01:22.030> achieve<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.950> have<00:01:24.880> about<00:01:25.210> a
