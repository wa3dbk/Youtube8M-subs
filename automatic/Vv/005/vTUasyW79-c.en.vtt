wanted to I know in my last video there
was<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> lends<00:00:29.789> noise<00:00:30.500> now

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
was a little bit of lends noise now

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.780 
was a little bit of lends noise now
there's<00:00:31.740> some<00:00:31.920> force<00:00:32.130> background<00:00:32.489> noise

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.430 

probably<00:00:35.790> gain<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.930> actually<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
probably gain here or or actually if you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.799 
probably gain here or or actually if you
can<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.239> cannot

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
can then that's not good if you cannot

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
can then that's not good if you cannot
hear<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.410> means<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.969> microphone<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
hear it that means the microphone is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
hear it that means the microphone is
actually<00:00:42.420> doing<00:00:42.629> his<00:00:42.719> job<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.469> great<00:00:44.180> that

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
actually doing his job it's great that

still really won't be able to those too

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.830 
still really won't be able to those too
much<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> difference

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.920 

still<00:02:03.289> this<00:02:03.409> test<00:02:03.770> again

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.680 

you<00:02:15.709> got<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> go<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.099> little<00:02:16.310> bit<00:02:16.519> off<00:02:16.610> center

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.740 

not<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:21.470> much

okay<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.950> want<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.370> test<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.090> speed<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
okay just want to test the speed and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.180 
okay just want to test the speed and
touch<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.140> sound<00:02:30.440> see<00:02:30.830> if<00:02:30.920> you're<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.130> to

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
touch the sound see if you're going to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.720 
touch the sound see if you're going to
get<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> loud<00:02:31.820> noise<00:02:32.770> gotta<00:02:33.770> love<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.700> a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
get a loud noise gotta love that so a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.770 
get a loud noise gotta love that so a
very<00:02:38.060> fast<00:02:38.420> autofocusing<00:02:39.200> speed<00:02:40.510> very<00:02:41.510> little

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
very fast autofocusing speed very little

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.040 
very fast autofocusing speed very little
lens<00:02:41.990> noise<00:02:42.260> I've<00:02:42.530> noticed<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.970> sots<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.780> think

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
lens noise I've noticed the sots I think

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.580 
lens noise I've noticed the sots I think
really<00:02:45.500> could<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:47.050> difference<00:02:48.050> maker<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:48.380> far

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
really could be difference maker as far

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.590 
really could be difference maker as far
as<00:02:49.150> SL<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.270> technology<00:02:50.810> but<00:02:52.390> time<00:02:53.390> will<00:02:53.540> tell

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
as SL of technology but time will tell

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.780 
as SL of technology but time will tell
obviously

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.289 

one<00:03:00.360> thing<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.659> have<00:03:00.900> noticed<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
one thing I have noticed of that if you

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.580 
one thing I have noticed of that if you
look<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.719> right<00:03:03.900> there's<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> lot<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.319> dark

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
look on the right there's a lot of dark

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.530 
look on the right there's a lot of dark
areas<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:06.980> then<00:03:07.980> if<00:03:08.219> we<00:03:08.400> go<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.359> dark

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
areas and then if we go to that dark

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.099 
areas and then if we go to that dark
area<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:11.010> we're<00:03:11.219> probably<00:03:11.700> exposed<00:03:12.090> but<00:03:12.930> now

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
area now we're probably exposed but now

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.410 
area now we're probably exposed but now
our<00:03:13.140> area<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.769> left<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.189> overexposed

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.260 

that<00:03:18.140> comes<00:03:18.380> back<00:03:18.590> in

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.380 

so<00:03:21.810> I've<00:03:22.590> seen<00:03:22.980> other<00:03:23.190> cameras<00:03:23.730> too<00:03:23.940> much

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
so I've seen other cameras too much

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.820 
so I've seen other cameras too much
worse<00:03:24.690> as<00:03:24.930> far<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> sifting<00:03:25.820> but<00:03:26.820> hey<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
worse as far as the sifting but hey I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.200 
worse as far as the sifting but hey I
know<00:03:28.830> why<00:03:29.040> every<00:03:29.310> time<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.580> do<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.730> video<00:03:29.970> I'm

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
know why every time I do a video I'm

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.170 
know why every time I do a video I'm
lucky<00:03:30.510> enough<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.840> see<00:03:31.020> someone<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:32.040> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
lucky enough to see someone on a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.320 
lucky enough to see someone on a
motorcycle

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.120 

I<00:03:36.450> don't<00:03:36.960> know<00:03:37.080> if<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.440> hear<00:03:37.710> but<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
I don't know if you can hear but the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.480 
I don't know if you can hear but the
engine<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.640> very<00:03:39.060> loud<00:03:39.770> if<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.190> once

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
engine is very loud if you can once

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.250 
engine is very loud if you can once
again<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:42.240> means<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.540> microphone<00:03:42.960> is<00:03:42.990> doing

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
again that means the microphone is doing

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.530 
again that means the microphone is doing
its<00:03:43.410> job<00:03:46.640> now<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.700> probably<00:03:48.030> don't<00:03:48.300> hear<00:03:48.510> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
its job now you probably don't hear it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.820 
its job now you probably don't hear it
as<00:03:48.780> loud<00:03:48.990> as<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.320> do

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.300
