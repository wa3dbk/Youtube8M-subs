00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
we're kind of focusing more about living

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
we're kind of focusing more about living
on<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.030> earth<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.899> what<00:01:45.899> would

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
on on this earth you know and what would

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.129 
on on this earth you know and what would
happen<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.499> is<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.770> last<00:01:47.899> your<00:01:48.899> lat

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:49.139 
happen if this is your last your lat

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:51.769 
happen if this is your last your lat
your<00:01:49.499> last<00:01:49.649> year<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.310> live<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.999> know<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:51.779 
your last year to live you know so I

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.919 
your last year to live you know so I

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
think that's sort of like maybe a little

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.510 
think that's sort of like maybe a little
bit<00:01:55.139> what<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.319> might<00:01:55.499> be<00:01:55.649> kind<00:01:55.859> of<00:01:55.979> touching<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
bit what we might be kind of touching on

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
bit what we might be kind of touching on

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
but we just kind of proved to ourselves

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.729 
but we just kind of proved to ourselves
that<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:38.420> write<00:02:38.690> stuff<00:02:39.409> that<00:02:39.620> we

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
that we can just write stuff that we

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.199 
that we can just write stuff that we
think<00:02:39.980> sounds<00:02:40.189> cool<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.730> doesn't<00:02:40.939> have<00:02:41.120> to

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
think sounds cool and doesn't have to

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.789 
think sounds cool and doesn't have to
all<00:02:41.329> flow<00:02:41.599> together<00:02:41.659> doesn't<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.349> all<00:02:42.500> sound

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
all flow together doesn't it all sound

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.890 
all flow together doesn't it all sound
the<00:02:42.829> same<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:44.450> totally<00:02:44.690> different

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
the same it can be totally different

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660 
the same it can be totally different
without<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.379> concept<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.159> I<00:02:46.190> think<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.640> really

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
without a concept so I think that really

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.990 
without a concept so I think that really
opened<00:02:47.180> up<00:02:47.239> my<00:02:47.510> mind<00:02:48.200> at<00:02:48.409> least<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.859> like<00:02:49.010> what

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
if i write something like this is that
