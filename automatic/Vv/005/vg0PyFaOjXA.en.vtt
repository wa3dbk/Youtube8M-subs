I could feel them under my skin

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.770 
I could feel them under my skin
especially<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.000> washing<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:51.450> face

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
especially when I was washing my face

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.130

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and those blemishes have basically

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
and those blemishes have basically
disappeared<00:01:55.829> there's<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> few<00:01:56.700> remaining

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
but most of them have actually totally

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.889

experience<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> texture<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.640> skin

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
experience the texture of my skin

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.969 
experience the texture of my skin
becoming<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.539> whole<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:09.929> smoother<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.800> more

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
becoming a whole lot smoother a lot more

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.790 
becoming a whole lot smoother a lot more
even<00:02:11.370> another<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.810> noticed

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
even another thing I noticed

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
even another thing I noticed
which<00:02:14.100> was<00:02:14.280> actually<00:02:14.640> my<00:02:14.760> favorite<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.840> that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
which was actually my favorite was that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550 
which was actually my favorite was that
the<00:02:16.980> oil<00:02:17.160> production<00:02:17.690> that<00:02:18.690> my<00:02:19.320> face

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the oil production that my face

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.680 
the oil production that my face
typically<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:20.310> has<00:02:20.970> been<00:02:21.180> completely

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
typically has has been completely

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
typically has has been completely
balanced<00:02:22.230> during<00:02:22.980> times<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.550> day<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
balanced during times of the day that I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.020 
balanced during times of the day that I
typically<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.690> experience<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.580> need<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
typically would experience the need to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.810 
typically would experience the need to
blot<00:02:27.390> my<00:02:27.660> face<00:02:27.990> or<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.770> wash<00:02:29.040> my<00:02:29.070> face<00:02:29.520> I

blot my face or want to wash my face I
didn't<00:02:30.240> even<00:02:30.330> reach<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.630> point<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.500> was

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
didn't even reach that point it was

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.420 
didn't even reach that point it was
pretty<00:02:32.550> awesome<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.960> even<00:02:34.650> now<00:02:34.860> I'm<00:02:35.160> really

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
pretty awesome and even now I'm really

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.490 
pretty awesome and even now I'm really
feeling<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.540> has<00:02:37.320> been

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
feeling like it's just has been

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.260 
feeling like it's just has been
completely<00:02:37.920> balanced<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.580> hasn't<00:02:38.970> caused<00:02:39.150> any

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
completely balanced it hasn't caused any

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.470 
completely balanced it hasn't caused any
extra<00:02:39.780> drying<00:02:40.110> effect<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:42.060> feeling

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
extra drying effect it really is feeling

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.320 
extra drying effect it really is feeling
great<00:02:43.040> another<00:02:44.040> thing<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.610> any<00:02:45.000> sort<00:02:45.270> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
great another thing is that any sort of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.290 
great another thing is that any sort of
blackheads<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.990> I've<00:02:46.080> had<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> sides

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
blackheads that I've had in on the sides

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.140 
blackheads that I've had in on the sides
of<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.570> nose<00:02:48.600> or<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.290> top<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.530> my<00:02:49.770> nose<00:02:50.150> have

of my nose or on top of my nose have
been<00:02:51.480> significantly<00:02:52.230> reduced<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
been significantly reduced so that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.080 
been significantly reduced so that
bacteria<00:02:55.500> that's<00:02:55.770> been<00:02:56.040> stuck<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.550> there<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
bacteria that's been stuck in there and

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.060 
bacteria that's been stuck in there and
creating<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.750> formation<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.680> blackhead

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
creating that formation of a blackhead

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.970 
creating that formation of a blackhead
has<00:02:59.610> actually<00:03:00.030> disappeared<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.620> know<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
has actually disappeared and I know that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.710 
has actually disappeared and I know that
is<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.550> big<00:03:02.820> struggle<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> lot<00:03:03.660> of

to reach places and let's see oh and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.070 
to reach places and let's see oh and
there<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.670> certain<00:03:12.300> times<00:03:12.540> when<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> actually

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080

for<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.680> healing<00:03:34.950> process<00:03:35.670> was<00:03:36.540> cut<00:03:37.050> in

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
for that the healing process was cut in

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.410 
for that the healing process was cut in
half<00:03:37.470> or<00:03:37.740> maybe<00:03:37.860> even<00:03:38.190> three<00:03:38.550> times<00:03:38.580> as<00:03:39.240> much

reduced

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.150 
reduced
they<00:03:53.220> almost<00:03:53.390> resembled<00:03:54.390> like<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.830> small<00:03:55.830> bug

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
they almost resembled like a small bug

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.490 
they almost resembled like a small bug
bite<00:03:56.430> there<00:03:57.150> was<00:03:57.300> something<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:57.900> trying<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
bite there was something there trying to

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.620 
bite there was something there trying to
form<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.040> then<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.250> actually<00:03:59.460> never<00:03:59.820> came<00:04:00.330> to

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
form and then it actually never came to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.560 
form and then it actually never came to
full<00:04:00.870> formation<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.920> then<00:04:02.070> quickly<00:04:02.790> healed<00:04:03.300> I

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
full formation and then quickly healed I

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.320 
full formation and then quickly healed I
was<00:04:04.260> actually<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:05.100> first-hand<00:04:05.730> experience

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
was actually like first-hand experience

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.480 
was actually like first-hand experience
of<00:04:06.540> something<00:04:07.170> coming<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.830> form<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.340> would

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490
