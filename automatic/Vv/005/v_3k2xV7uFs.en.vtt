00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
disappointing thing about this product

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.899 
disappointing thing about this product
was<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> received<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.430> had<00:01:59.759> actually

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
was when I received it it had actually

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
was when I received it it had actually
opened<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> bag<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> spilled

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
opened in the bag and it kind of spilled

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.160 
opened in the bag and it kind of spilled
so<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.759> requested<00:02:03.329> another<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
so I requested another one and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.200 
so I requested another one and
unfortunately<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.040> happened<00:02:05.460> again<00:02:05.909> with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
unfortunately that happened again with

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.020 
unfortunately that happened again with
the<00:02:06.869> second<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> got<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.459> think<00:02:08.940> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the second one I got so I do think that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.839 
the second one I got so I do think that
there<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.690> slight<00:02:10.050> flaw<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.280> pump<00:02:11.580> or

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
there is a slight flaw with the pump or

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.640 
there is a slight flaw with the pump or
the<00:02:11.879> bottle<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the bottle because it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.069 
the bottle because it
phil's<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.519> not<00:02:14.849> exactly<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.540> moose<00:02:15.810> foam

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
phil's and it's not exactly a moose foam

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.210 
phil's and it's not exactly a moose foam
like<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.470> supposed<00:02:16.829> to<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:20.069> into

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
like it's supposed to be and going into

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.300 
like it's supposed to be and going into
drying<00:02:20.610> time<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.180> did<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.810> about<00:02:22.079> 15<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:23.010> 20

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
drying time it did take about 15 to 20

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.589 
drying time it did take about 15 to 20
minutes<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.730> dry<00:02:23.909> which<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.209> actually<00:02:24.569> very

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
minutes to dry which is actually very

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.210 
minutes to dry which is actually very
good<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.989> was<00:02:25.170> surprised<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.829> I<00:02:25.860> didn't

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
last about 2 to 4 days I noticed so it's

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.379 
last about 2 to 4 days I noticed so it's
a<00:03:04.290> little<00:03:05.189> less<00:03:05.400> than<00:03:05.579> average<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:06.060> about

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
a little less than average or about

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.300 
a little less than average or about
average<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.950> apply<00:03:08.069> it
