00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
because this is kind of like a little

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.040 
because this is kind of like a little
side<00:03:31.160> street<00:03:31.370> okay<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.300> you<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.450> let<00:03:32.780> off<00:03:32.930> the

side street okay so you just let off the
gas<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.500> little<00:03:33.530> bit<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:34.100> just<00:03:34.550> kind<00:03:34.760> of<00:03:34.820> slow

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
gas a little bit I just kind of slow

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.970 
gas a little bit I just kind of slow
yourself<00:03:35.150> down<00:03:35.420> that<00:03:35.750> way<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.710> we're<00:03:36.860> going

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
yourself down that way and we're going

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.010

because you know there's a turn coming

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.449 
because you know there's a turn coming
and<00:04:01.239> if<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.900> need<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.349> break<00:04:02.650> break<00:04:03.069> but<00:04:03.370> you
