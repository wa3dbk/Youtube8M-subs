00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
bring out all of your elements will hear

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.690 
bring out all of your elements will hear
of<00:00:11.130> fusions<00:00:11.580> via<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.420> card<00:00:13.219> this<00:00:14.219> card<00:00:14.280> is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
of fusions via this card this card is

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.040 
of fusions via this card this card is
going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.030> used<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> most<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.809> also<00:00:16.260> have

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
going to be used the most you also have

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.890 
going to be used the most you also have
miracle<00:00:19.050> fusion<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.100> also<00:00:20.279> have

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
miracle fusion and you also have

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.540 
miracle fusion and you also have
parallel<00:00:21.900> world<00:00:22.109> fusion<00:00:22.470> know<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:23.310> makes

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
parallel world fusion know what makes

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
parallel world fusion know what makes
parallel<00:00:23.970> world<00:00:24.180> fusion<00:00:24.510> good<00:00:24.779> well<00:00:25.500> with

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
parallel world fusion good well with

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
parallel world fusion good well with
fusion<00:00:26.580> gate<00:00:26.730> your<00:00:27.330> guys<00:00:27.539> are<00:00:27.779> removed<00:00:28.109> from

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
fusion gate your guys are removed from

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
fusion gate your guys are removed from
play<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.920> card<00:00:29.189> automatically<00:00:29.939> becomes

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
play so this card automatically becomes

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
play so this card automatically becomes
live<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.500> really<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.279> powerful

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
live and it's really really powerful

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.940 
live and it's really really powerful
also<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.719> Shining's<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.620> really

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
also your Shining's just get really

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.459 
also your Shining's just get really
really<00:00:35.250> bulky<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.050> guys<00:00:37.200> are

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
really bulky because all of you guys are

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.819 
really bulky because all of you guys are
going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.829> removed<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.340> play<00:00:39.440> now<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> get

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
going to be removed from play now to get

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.650 
going to be removed from play now to get
to<00:00:41.010> my<00:00:41.100> fusion<00:00:41.520> gate<00:00:41.610> i<00:00:41.820> am<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.239> 3

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
to my fusion gate i am using 3

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
to my fusion gate i am using 3
terraforming<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.469> feel<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.149> staple

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
terraforming I feel that it's a staple

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.600 
terraforming I feel that it's a staple
in<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.050> suppose<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.739> could<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in here I suppose you could go down the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.810 
in here I suppose you could go down the
two<00:00:47.820> copies<00:00:48.239> maybe<00:00:48.570> even<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.079> because

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
two copies maybe even one because

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.250 
two copies maybe even one because
technically<00:00:50.820> once<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.360> get<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.809> fusion

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
technically once you get to one fusion

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260 
technically once you get to one fusion
gate<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> okay<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.239> don't

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
gate you should be okay but you don't

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.959 
gate you should be okay but you don't
want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> play<00:00:54.780> fusion<00:00:55.140> gate<00:00:55.410> them<00:00:55.739> msting<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
want to play fusion gate them msting and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
want to play fusion gate them msting and
then<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> handful<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.109> monsters<00:00:58.649> or

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
then you have a handful of monsters or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.240 
then you have a handful of monsters or
you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.730> something<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.250> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
you know just something like that so you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.000 
you know just something like that so you
know<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.879> safe<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.359> sorry<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> last

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
know better be safe than sorry the last

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.670 
know better be safe than sorry the last
spell<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> wanted<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.930> super

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
spell that I wanted to go over is super

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.969 
spell that I wanted to go over is super
polymerization<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.049> easily<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
polymerization this is easily one of the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.510 
polymerization this is easily one of the
best<00:01:11.070> cards<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> game<00:01:12.260> some<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.369> know

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
best cards in the game some you you know

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
best cards in the game some you you know
may<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.939> believe<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.100> the

may not believe that but you get the

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
may not believe that but you get the
fuse<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:17.909> cards<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> board<00:01:18.930> either<00:01:19.170> side

fuse two cards on the board either side
and<00:01:20.450> your<00:01:21.450> opponent<00:01:21.930> cannot<00:01:22.020> chained<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> this
