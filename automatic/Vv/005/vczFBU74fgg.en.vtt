you'll see now that the pump is loose
all<00:02:53.000> right<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.480> I'm<00:02:54.079> going<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.489> walk<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.519> belt

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
all right so I'm going to walk the belt

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:08.920 
all right so I'm going to walk the belt
off<00:03:06.730> put<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.819> belt<00:03:08.000> back<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.599> feed<00:03:08.810> it

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
off put the belt back on and feed it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.599 
off put the belt back on and feed it
over<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.170> water<00:03:09.319> pump<00:03:09.650> pulley<00:03:10.420> back<00:03:11.420> onto<00:03:11.659> the

over the water pump pulley back onto the

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:22.270 
over the water pump pulley back onto the
backside<00:03:16.689> match<00:03:17.689> up<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.019> ribs<00:03:21.069> making<00:03:22.069> sure

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
backside match up the ribs making sure

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.830 
backside match up the ribs making sure
that<00:03:22.400> it's<00:03:22.549> fully<00:03:22.790> seated<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.449> that

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
that it's fully seated on that that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.300 
that it's fully seated on that that
pulley<00:03:24.109> because<00:03:24.530> if<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.739> not<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:24.919> going<00:03:25.250> to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
pulley because if it's not it's going to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.369 
pulley because if it's not it's going to
not<00:03:26.000> go<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.269> easily<00:03:26.480> then<00:03:26.959> I'm<00:03:27.049> going<00:03:27.199> to<00:03:27.230> walk

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
not go on easily then I'm going to walk

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.129 
not go on easily then I'm going to walk
it<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.940> slowly<00:03:28.940> turning<00:03:29.299> applying<00:03:29.720> pressure

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.059 

test<00:03:33.139> it<00:03:33.430> spin<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.459> nicely<00:03:34.699> and<00:03:35.889> we<00:03:36.889> use<00:03:37.010> a

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
test it spin it nicely and we use a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.689 
test it spin it nicely and we use a
breaker<00:03:37.280> bar<00:03:37.370> here<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.970> place<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.510> between

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
breaker bar here and place it between

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.670 
breaker bar here and place it between

the top bolt on the power steering pump
and<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.280> engine<00:03:43.549> bracket<00:03:46.299> apply<00:03:47.299> pressure

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
and the engine bracket apply pressure

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.809 
and the engine bracket apply pressure
until<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.109> belt<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.409> tight<00:03:48.699> should<00:03:49.699> be<00:03:49.790> a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
little bit of resistance snug this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:36.270 
little bit of resistance snug this
pothole<00:03:54.889> back<00:03:55.459> up

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.830 

and<00:04:37.280> next<00:04:37.880> year<00:04:38.000> I'm<00:04:38.090> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.270> take<00:04:38.450> off<00:04:38.600> the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
and next year I'm going to take off the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.870 
and next year I'm going to take off the
splash<00:04:39.229> shield<00:04:39.650> that's<00:04:39.860> behind<00:04:40.280> the

splash shield that's behind the
passenger's<00:04:41.870> front<00:04:42.260> tire<00:04:42.560> this<00:04:43.280> just<00:04:43.580> allows

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
passenger's front tire this just allows

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.969 
passenger's front tire this just allows
you<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.180> get<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.780> alternator<00:04:45.169> belt<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.860> get

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
you to get to the alternator belt to get

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.800 
you to get to the alternator belt to get
it<00:04:46.100> back<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.460> little<00:04:46.700> easier<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.540> don't

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
it back on a little easier you don't

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.930 
it back on a little easier you don't
have<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.200> do<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:49.070> can<00:04:49.250> try<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.550> feed<00:04:49.820> the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
have to do this you can try to feed the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.780 
have to do this you can try to feed the
alternator<00:04:50.330> belt<00:04:50.510> down<00:04:51.050> from<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.440> top<00:04:51.790> but

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
alternator belt down from the top but

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.219 
alternator belt down from the top but
usually<00:04:53.150> it's<00:04:53.240> a<00:04:53.300> little<00:04:53.510> easier<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.810> feed<00:04:54.110> it

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
usually it's a little easier to feed it

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:01.070 
usually it's a little easier to feed it
in<00:04:54.320> this<00:04:54.530> way

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.770 

put<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.199> alternator<00:05:02.620> belt<00:05:02.800> back<00:05:03.039> up<00:05:03.569> you<00:05:04.569> get
