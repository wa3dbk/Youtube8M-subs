00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 because I do not have a day 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 several or halal to the Russian doll in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.960
 done I should talk a lot about one is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.920
 a little bit of two ok ok I 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.439
 start with the one I was not talking about 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 badly it's called the collector of 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.910
 Easter Gerard agrees beautiful ring 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 maybe because she's obsessed at all 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.469
 no going to be beaten redhead missed chronic 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 my grand you give me your little investigation 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.440
 and see that I have already chronicled in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 pascale night gÃ©rard he's from Quebec 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.200
 yes I do not know how much I can 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 to tell without it making me shit because 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.899
 that I tell you but basically 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.969
 history is autobiographical 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.699
 pascale gerard is a young man who 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.600
 is comic author so he has already published 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 two books that have quite a lot 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.350
 market and more 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.350
 and then actually at the beginning of the book he gets 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.149
 dropped like a shit after a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 nine-year history so it's basically 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.510
 he will move temporarily to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.040
 friends who have a baby so already he 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.909
 feel that he is they are nice of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.140
 welcome him but hey that's it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.400
 and in fact that's where it does not stop 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 send him all the time boxes of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 his business as I go 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.600
 remove all nice you resume your shit 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 and especially its two billion bd 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.009
 so there are boxes of books everywhere 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.110
 she sends him also I would find myself 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.220
 she sends him a big giant head 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.270
 of itself because there was a 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 halloween we had come disguised 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 one in the other and suddenly he loses 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.009
 strangely to him returns the big head 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.299
 once he paused in his room and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.740
 he tries to think of something else and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.600
 the big head of his ex parte to whom the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.909
 look later at his bases to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.380
 so the instar is a big discount 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.710
 question he says ok that's fine I got 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.150
 got dumped so I leave with nothing I 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 am going to stop being a comic writer i'm going 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.479

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.430
 jobsite the guys 10 m -t was already arousing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.079
 do that and he hangs out in a bookstore 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.250
 com all the time and booksellers him 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.140
 say we have a problem in this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.230
 bookstore is that we're full of this 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.760
 comic all the time someone is flying 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.050
 drunk we do not know who it is and someday 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.280
 he's in the bookstore and he sees 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.170
 a pretty cute year in the process of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.670
 flip through his comic book to him so he's getting ready 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.620
 to kind it is I who made 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 alas the Danish steal the book actually 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.340
 and so begins a story and that 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.290
 do you know who will follow to try 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.430
 to say it is on one side you stole the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.990
 book at the same time I'm father done and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.250
 besides you're cute and he's going to live 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.660
 a kind of romance with this girl 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.280
 knowing that their starting point of their 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.330
 story it's actually you want some 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.580
 books put to roll come so that's 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.050
 cool and so he goes little by little 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.970
 give up a lot of stuff and then good 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.230
 I do not tell you everything really there 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.410
 for once I do not think anything at all 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.260
 and so it's very good it's very funny 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 and then and then it's great and it's 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.890
 well this little world parenthesis at the end 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.380
 a big story we say good at 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 an insect from ok ok actually is that 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 I take this opportunity to make the beginning of 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.150
 really something else it was the opportunity 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.130
 to ask me the right questions of 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.600
 change lives all that and then this 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.030
 funny story with this thief from 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.140
 books who is not a thief she says I 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.810
 do not steal I collect them 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.980
 hence the title is great after I 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.600
 will show pictures too because 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.880
 because it's good it's from the line 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.620
 clear black and white very expressive 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.840
 super simple so that would come in 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.190
 and if not less time and less 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.300
 the opportunity to linger on but 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.920
 nevertheless as I read them recently 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.150
 I wanted to talk about 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.590
 rascals who have absolutely nothing to 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.720
 see 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.959
 finally if a little bit makes it a tea for 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.820
 yumiko defat better obata which is so 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.880
 and japanese we doubt this is the story 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.950
 a chick who is funny say a little 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.170
 it looks like the beginning of a house brown 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.180
 know it's a 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.099
 a Japanese girl who lives in london who 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.480
 is a graphic designer she learns that her father 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.920
 is dead so she has to go back to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.110
 japan she has not been there for 10 years and 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.010
 she goes there and she realizes that her 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.280
 relationship with his father was not at all 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.620
 what she believes at once is cute 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.510
 cute painful this is the worst is so 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.800
 she says to herself when she goes back there 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.600
 that she became a stranger there 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.110
 than abroad in England good brief 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.450
 but especially that in fact she is supposed 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 to be hyper sad she is surrounded by 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870
 full of people who are but she is 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.950
 weird I feel nothing so 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.660
 it parallels the theater 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.910
 from one to the Japanese where we put masks 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.500
 and here is the highlight of this book on 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.450
 not going to lie to each other is that drawing and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.370
 to be completely to die for 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 also constantly between wonder 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.109
 and jealousy because it's really 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.489
 so beautiful it's crazy it's crazy 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.690
 I wanted to change jobs here 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.090
 he is the sage of the good but very good 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.290
 I stop everything is too beautiful it's 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.780
 this slice of which we will find 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.450
 images and in another register the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.510
 scar from laughing sheets scar 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.100
 gilles rochier thanks to the diction 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.800
 potential I have two rocks it does not speak 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.260
 no more nice your mother the bitch 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.970
 oh yes yes but yes yes 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.130
 so I'm going to do the real reviews 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.020
 of comics we find this writing clean 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.789
 and the rocks both percussive and 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.060
 I do not know how to finish this 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.100
 sentence is the story of a guy who has 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.990
 the thirties who zonent get married who has 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.460
 a real job we have a jacket and we 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.630
 do not know what he's doing but he ad 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.220
 other big colleagues who make 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.950
 jokes in the canteen and his job that 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.020
 to hell 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.060
 and one day he is at home taking his 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.500
 shower his wife and 18 at the quarters 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.810
 but parents come to dinner and he 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.180
 is in the shower it's weird ok 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.650
 so I have for 17 seconds shows in 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.780
 hand he realizes he has a 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.070
 scar and he says but to tangier it's 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.450
 again he has a super big scar 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.950
 and says to himself it's funny he asks his 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.660
 family says he actually they do not find 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.100
 of opportunity asks his wife if he 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.970
 had him before he goes to see his parents 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.380
 but it does not happen too much 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.090
 of opportunity actually he has this guy 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.040
 communicate with no one circle he has 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.150
 beautiful having he wants to ask the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.290
 question to his brother to his friends 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.550
 of childhood and in fact every time 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.840
 communication is so crappy 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.110
 who does not know where it comes from 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.850
 this scar and they say to themselves I am 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.270
 not crazy I'll know if I had something 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.430
 like that 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.220
 and in fact he also becomes aware 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.810
 from the fact that he's in a tumult like 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.820
 that but that makes it arises full of 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.530
 questions about his life and this moment 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.060
 particular who is this species of 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.380
 scars that just put a little a 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.520
 kick in the anthill in his 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.530
 life that's why it makes me a little 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.260
 think of it that's a 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.000
 event a little unexpected and crazy is 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.060
 dramatic is good that you say maltes 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.980
 in fact what is my life and 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.090
 bugue completely so both of them have me 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.380
 still a little bit reminiscent one 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.090
 to the other even if then for the shot 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.950
 graphically it has nothing to do with 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.890
 the narration neither nothing but it's great 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.090
 the two tullaye to a little more panting 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.410
 you go a little more to the blade but it's 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.480
 what this scar and this one is
