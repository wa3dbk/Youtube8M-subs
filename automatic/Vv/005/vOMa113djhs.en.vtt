with some heel raises this one again
well<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> calves<00:01:58.680> actually<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> little

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
well the calves actually are a little

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.370 
well the calves actually are a little
bit<00:01:59.490> stronger<00:02:00.090> muscles<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.020> kind<00:02:01.350> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
bit stronger muscles that are kind of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.230

capable of a little bit more wear and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
capable of a little bit more wear and
tear<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.780> them<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.049> recommend<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:04.979> find<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
tear on them I recommend that we find a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.370 
tear on them I recommend that we find a
way<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.880> get<00:02:06.030> through<00:02:06.240> about<00:02:06.689> 15

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
way that you can get through about 15

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.609 
way that you can get through about 15

of<00:04:27.180> motion<00:04:27.240> right<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:27.720> I'm<00:04:28.380> going<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.650> put

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
of motion right there I'm going to put

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.290 
of motion right there I'm going to put
it<00:04:28.890> right<00:04:29.010> back<00:04:29.190> down<00:04:29.250> here<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.150> we're

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
it right back down here so we're

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
it right back down here so we're
actually<00:04:30.480> working<00:04:30.750> through<00:04:31.320> my<00:04:31.770> full<00:04:32.010> range

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
actually working through my full range

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.250 
actually working through my full range
of<00:04:32.430> motion<00:04:32.610> we're<00:04:33.390> then<00:04:33.510> going<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.720> adjust<00:04:34.110> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
of motion we're then going to adjust the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.960 
of motion we're then going to adjust the
amount<00:04:34.380> of<00:04:34.680> weight<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.130> want<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.490> lift<00:04:35.700> and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
amount of weight that I want to lift and

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.850 
amount of weight that I want to lift and
this<00:04:36.270> exercise<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.050> performed<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.620> I<00:04:37.650> engage

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
this exercise is performed when I engage

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.710 
this exercise is performed when I engage
these<00:04:38.310> muscles<00:04:38.730> right<00:04:38.820> here<00:04:39.180> on<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.390> top<00:04:39.570> of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
these muscles right here on the top of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.420 
these muscles right here on the top of
my<00:04:39.810> legs<00:04:40.080> I'm<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> kick<00:04:40.890> my<00:04:41.010> legs<00:04:41.250> out

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
my legs I'm going to kick my legs out

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.150 
my legs I'm going to kick my legs out
all<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.120> way<00:04:42.240> straight<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.930> then<00:04:43.410> return<00:04:44.010> to

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
all the way straight and then return to

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.070 
all the way straight and then return to
that<00:04:44.280> starting<00:04:44.700> position<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.480> that's<00:04:45.840> what

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
that starting position and that's what

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.980 
that starting position and that's what
the<00:04:46.200> knee<00:04:46.380> extension<00:04:46.980> machine<00:04:47.820> looks<00:04:48.750> like

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
the knee extension machine looks like

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.930 
the knee extension machine looks like
and<00:04:49.230> what<00:04:50.070> I'm<00:04:50.160> going<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.340> do<00:04:50.520> here<00:04:50.730> I'm<00:04:50.850> going

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
and what I'm going to do here I'm going

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.580 
and what I'm going to do here I'm going
to<00:04:51.000> shoot<00:04:51.180> for<00:04:51.300> about<00:04:51.420> 10<00:04:51.900> reps<00:04:52.200> you're<00:04:52.470> going

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
to shoot for about 10 reps you're going

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.930 
to shoot for about 10 reps you're going
to<00:04:52.650> feel<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.830> burn<00:04:53.190> right<00:04:53.460> here<00:04:53.640> up<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:53.850> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
to feel that burn right here up on the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.400 
to feel that burn right here up on the
top<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.390> top<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.780> legs<00:04:54.990> top<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.350> the

quad muscles and then I'm going to go

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.180 
quad muscles and then I'm going to go
back<00:04:57.120> to<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.420> first<00:04:57.690> machine<00:04:58.200> and<00:04:58.410> so<00:04:58.980> what<00:04:59.160> I

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
back to that first machine and so what I

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.560 
back to that first machine and so what I
did<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.610> showed<00:04:59.760> you<00:04:59.910> four<00:05:00.210> different

did is I showed you four different

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.360 
did is I showed you four different
exercises<00:05:01.260> you're<00:05:01.680> going<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.010> them<00:05:02.220> in

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
exercises you're going to do them in

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.850 
exercises you're going to do them in
series<00:05:02.820> 10<00:05:03.150> reps<00:05:03.450> 10<00:05:03.690> reps<00:05:03.930> 10<00:05:04.170> reps<00:05:04.380> 10<00:05:04.650> reps

and then you're going to go through that

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.020 
and then you're going to go through that
circuit<00:05:06.810> three<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.560> four<00:05:07.830> times<00:05:08.130> depending<00:05:08.880> on

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
circuit three to four times depending on

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.660 
circuit three to four times depending on
how<00:05:09.180> your<00:05:09.390> legs<00:05:09.570> hold<00:05:09.810> up<00:05:09.990> try<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:10.950> out<00:05:11.100> next

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
how your legs hold up try it out next

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:21.140 
how your legs hold up try it out next
next<00:05:12.030> leg<00:05:12.210> day<00:05:12.390> on<00:05:12.600> me
