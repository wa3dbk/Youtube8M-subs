basically see the way you can't access

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.680 
basically see the way you can't access
any<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.829> part<00:02:50.190> near<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> ocean<00:02:51.209> or

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
any of this part near the ocean or

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.899 
any of this part near the ocean or
hopefully<00:02:52.379> with<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.799> good<00:02:53.099> pool<00:02:53.310> update<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
hopefully with this good pool update you

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.039 
hopefully with this good pool update you
be<00:02:54.060> able<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.450> purchase<00:02:55.280> parts<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:57.049> not

too<00:02:58.170> sure<00:02:58.349> how<00:02:58.470> that's<00:02:58.650> going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.859> work<00:02:58.920> out

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
too sure how that's going to work out

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.449 
too sure how that's going to work out
but<00:02:59.250> hopefully<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.659> should<00:03:00.870> go<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.109> plan<00:03:01.459> i'm

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459
