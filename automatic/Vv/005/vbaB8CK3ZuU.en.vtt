00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.829
 i am Promecap salt 1 and today I will 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.080
 to talk about what basis of makeup 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:11.639
 use for your skin type as you know 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.129
 We all have different skin types 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.529
 what is the normal skin the fat the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.750
 mixed or the dry how to know what kind of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.660
 skin you have is very simple if you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.170
 are for example those that limit 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.460
 of the day are already shining completely 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.470
 they are definitely fats and for example 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 they realize that nothing else begins to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.520
 shine like this area which is the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.190
 forehead nose and chin is just 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 zone t is mixed skin that can be that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.130
 be the most gross and normal skin in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.140
 rest of the face and if for example 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.850
 you are the ones who make up and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 logo or patíbulo that you suck the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.870
 makeup you eat it good is that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.550
 you are dry skin what type of makeup is not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.440
 everyone goes to those who throw for all 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.150
 skins good if you can make it work 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.040
 but you have to know how you already know 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.080
 what kind of skin are first of all 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.970
 you have to know how to prepare the skin remember 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.310
 that is in oily skin you have to hydrate it 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.350
 well with special creams to have them 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.330
 If your skin is normal, it has a good 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 great advantage can use any type 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.689
 of base either liquid in per 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 or mousse cream of many types these 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.159
 you are perfect, you can be the one 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.170
 you crave them in your skin is dry them 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 I recommend something that is very creamy or 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 very liquid this for example good I say 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 the option that tells them it's a little 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.539
 face that channel vita lumière that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.670
 hydrates perfectly or for example 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.409
 they are something a little bit softer 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.359
 bobby braun that his bases are very 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.310
 liquid and you say good to me 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.560
 budget does not give for that there is no 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.569
 problem they tell you a normal basis what 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.789
 let's do at the base they're going to mix 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.759
 with a little bit of her moisturizer the 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.170
 face the mixture and they will apply it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.329
 then that form are achieving a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.579
 special base for dry skin if they are 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.229
 oily skin that is all over the face what 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.750
 we need is to be free 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.579
 fat and preferably powder 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.469
 so he can absorb and we 're not 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.569
 shining that what we do not like for 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.489
 example mascara has one that is called that 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.229
 It is matte to treat this typical aroma 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.629
 all day or for example the most 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.709
 we use powders that is like the study 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.810
 fix of mch 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.940
 this is a powder that has a little that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.350
 It has color and has very good adhesion 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.230
 and can be used as a base 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.120
 of spots or imperfections we are something 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.130
 make it a little stronger that covers us 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.540
 perfectly this type of skin then 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.690
 I recommend a base type 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.970
 pancake that you are if it is much more 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.100
 loaded heavier but covers 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.800
 perfectly and if for example your skin 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.050
 is with good acne can you watch a video of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.180
 how these kinds of faces died or also 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
 I recommend that they be dust and that they be 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.900
 fat free this is very important 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.430
 because sometimes when we have acne what 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.320
 that we least want is to see 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.930
 then we are upholstering the cap of 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.480
 intra step on it and what it does is that it 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.520
 clog the pores sometimes and you get more 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.100
 acne then is counterproductive from 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.780
 the roof already there are some bases of 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.180
 makeup that contain acid 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.740
 salicylic to avoid it helps you 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.810
 you also follow it up, you're going to 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.850
 help improve your skin type is by 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.100
 example they have clinical and neutrogena and 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.570
 Well, I hope this one has 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.490
 helped a little to know what kind 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.080
 of base use according to your type of 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.730
 skin takes if you have any doubt or
