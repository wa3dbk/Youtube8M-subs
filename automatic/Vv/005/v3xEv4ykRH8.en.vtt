 a luxury to have or something similar but the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 people can wait for changes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810

 no 3d model seen in the movie since 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.270

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.930
 different there, and promised to tie the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.989

 revealed that the company should return to 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.110
 to work with sequences that are 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.790
 present time but took care to 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.020
 do not drop any spoilers 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.510
 he said that one of the things 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.250
 relevant to the team is to ensure 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.680
 importance in the moments that happen 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.720
 nowadays and this will be very clear 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.380
 in the new cycle of the plot that the game will 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.300
 to adopt 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 You think you're going to say goodbye to whoever 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.520
 arrives on October 23 for xbox one and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.710

 confirmed and will arrive in 2016 year 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.410
 Come on. I honestly will not open my 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.540
 I do not know if it's good, I hope it's 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.000
 good but I'm kind of afraid so with 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.830
 these games going out once a year, 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 go to the news confirmation was 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.450
 made by the cia clearance there blake 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.820
 jorgensen when asked about the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
 main games of the company in the future 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.410
 the executive commented that the focus for 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.020
 next two years is to have shooting games 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.340
 As the center of everything this year we have 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.410
 a bar or border this Wednesday for the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.580
 front and next year comes a new 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.140
 battlefield 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.580
 but he did not comment on which studio 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.380
 going to work on the game is worth remembering 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.660
 that the online radio that came out 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.760
 this year was made by visceral games 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.070
 and to the one that made a lovely weekend away 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.739

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.050

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.180

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.550

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.480
 said the team that puts the heat 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.459
 use 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.160
 It worked for me anyway, I gave it to you. 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.330
 people get shot neither the pt nor took the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.850

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.190
 experiences with games and a lot of time 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.200
 Unfortunately the game is not 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.700
 been canceled will not roll over but the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.930
 game left Peter's sinister legacy 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.910
 wallison road that has a footprint 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.739
 similar and also a guy who solved 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.950

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.870
 sharing of images 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.440
 playstation 4 and got screenshots of 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.480
