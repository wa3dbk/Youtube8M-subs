00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.540 

all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.260> in<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.040> want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.310> do<00:00:02.429> an

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
all right in this video I want to do an

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.940 
all right in this video I want to do an
example<00:00:02.879> related<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.170> law<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.470> cosines

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
example related to the law of cosines

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.849 
example related to the law of cosines
and<00:00:05.460> what<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.210> law<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.450> cosines<00:00:06.960> says<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.680> says

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
and what the law of cosines says it says

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.150 
and what the law of cosines says it says
if<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.220> triangle<00:00:09.260> with<00:00:10.260> side<00:00:10.710> lengths

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
if you have a triangle with side lengths

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.940 
if you have a triangle with side lengths
a<00:00:11.280> B<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.179> C<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.750> again<00:00:12.960> those<00:00:13.230> are<00:00:13.259> opposite

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a B and C and again those are opposite

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.050 
a B and C and again those are opposite
the<00:00:13.980> angles<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.670> B<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.780> C<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.500> says<00:00:17.279> basically

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the angles a B and C it says basically

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900 
the angles a B and C it says basically
the<00:00:18.449> idea<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.039> suppose<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.250> didn't<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.640> C

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the idea is suppose we didn't know C

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
the idea is suppose we didn't know C
here<00:00:21.240> suppose<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.600> knew<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.289> B<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:23.310> suppose

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
here suppose we knew a and B but suppose

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.670 
here suppose we knew a and B but suppose
we<00:00:23.640> also<00:00:24.029> knew<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.420> angle<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.080> between<00:00:25.230> them

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we also knew the angle in between them

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.820 
we also knew the angle in between them
so<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.789> angle<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> C<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.810> says<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.650> figure

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
so the angle of C it says we can figure

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
so the angle of C it says we can figure
out<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> angle<00:00:29.609> C<00:00:29.820> by<00:00:30.060> using<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.539> formula<00:00:31.019> C

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
out the angle C by using the formula C

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.160 
out the angle C by using the formula C
squared<00:00:31.590> equals<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.070> squared<00:00:32.099> plus<00:00:32.640> B<00:00:32.850> squared

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
squared equals a squared plus B squared

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.010 
squared equals a squared plus B squared
minus<00:00:34.170> 2<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> B<00:00:34.710> cosine<00:00:35.430> C<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.420> again<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.690> basic

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
minus 2 a B cosine C so again the basic

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
minus 2 a B cosine C so again the basic
idea<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> know<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.700> sides<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
idea is if you know two of the sides of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.240 
idea is if you know two of the sides of
the<00:00:39.360> triangle<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.320> know<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> angle<00:00:41.070> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the triangle and you know the angle in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.639 
the triangle and you know the angle in
between<00:00:41.309> those<00:00:41.910> two<00:00:42.210> sides<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
between those two sides then you have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.470 
between those two sides then you have
enough<00:00:43.890> information<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.610> figure<00:00:45.000> out<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
enough information to figure out the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.500 
enough information to figure out the
last<00:00:45.960> remaining<00:00:46.410> side<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> let's<00:00:50.969> do<00:00:51.180> kind<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
last remaining side so let's do kind of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.750 
last remaining side so let's do kind of
a<00:00:51.660> hopefully<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> straightforward<00:00:52.760> example

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a hopefully a straightforward example

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.729 
a hopefully a straightforward example
here<00:00:56.719> okay<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.750> we're<00:00:57.960> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> find<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here okay so we're going to find the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.930 
here okay so we're going to find the
missing<00:00:59.160> side<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> triangle<00:01:00.270> p80<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.940> we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
missing side of the triangle p80 if we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880 
missing side of the triangle p80 if we
know<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> few<00:01:03.359> things<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.199> what's<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
know a few things here so what's that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
know a few things here so what's that
I'm<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> make<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.990> little

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
I'm going to make a little little

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.969 
I'm going to make a little little
picture<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.740> let's<00:01:08.930> call<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> P<00:01:10.439> we'll<00:01:10.770> call

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
picture so let's call this P we'll call

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.179 
picture so let's call this P we'll call
this<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.350> we'll<00:01:13.470> call<00:01:13.500> t

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
this a and the other one we'll call t

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.709 
this a and the other one we'll call t
so<00:01:15.789> we're<00:01:16.179> told<00:01:16.329> that<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.689> angle<00:01:17.289> P<00:01:18.189> a

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
so we're told that the angle P a

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.889 
so we're told that the angle P a
t-that's<00:01:19.719> 30<00:01:20.350> degrees<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.479> we're<00:01:22.630> given<00:01:22.869> that

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
t-that's 30 degrees so we're given that

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.370 
t-that's 30 degrees so we're given that
angle<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.640> says<00:01:25.030> P<00:01:25.270> to<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.869> has<00:01:26.049> length

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
angle it says P to a that has length

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.370 
angle it says P to a that has length
four<00:01:26.829> point<00:01:27.130> six<00:01:27.549> centimeters<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.689> then<00:01:29.229> it

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
four point six centimeters and then it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.309 
four point six centimeters and then it
says<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.829> to<00:01:29.950> T<00:01:30.459> that<00:01:30.880> has<00:01:30.909> length<00:01:31.359> nine<00:01:31.840> point

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
says a to T that has length nine point

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.880 
says a to T that has length nine point
three<00:01:32.590> centimeters<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.780> now<00:01:35.259> we're<00:01:35.560> simply

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
three centimeters and now we're simply

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.559 
three centimeters and now we're simply
going<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.099> use<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.429> law<00:01:36.609> of<00:01:36.640> cosines<00:01:37.240> to

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
going to use the law of cosines to

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.419 
going to use the law of cosines to
figure<00:01:37.869> out<00:01:38.020> everything<00:01:38.649> else<00:01:39.130> that's

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
figure out everything else that's

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.910 
figure out everything else that's
missing<00:01:39.640> so<00:01:40.179> if<00:01:40.840> you<00:01:41.140> want<00:01:41.349> to<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.709> kind

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
missing so if you want to you can kind

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.380 
missing so if you want to you can kind
of<00:01:41.950> think<00:01:42.159> about<00:01:42.219> this<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.939> way<00:01:43.060> we<00:01:43.209> had<00:01:43.359> it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
of think about this the way we had it

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.569 
of think about this the way we had it
labeled<00:01:43.929> a<00:01:44.049> second<00:01:44.380> ago<00:01:44.590> this<00:01:44.829> is<00:01:44.979> our<00:01:45.130> side

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
labeled a second ago this is our side

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.179 
labeled a second ago this is our side
length<00:01:45.909> C<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.649> what<00:01:47.829> we're<00:01:47.950> going<00:01:48.069> to<00:01:48.099> use

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
length C and what we're going to use

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.800 
length C and what we're going to use
that<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.789> can<00:01:49.000> think<00:01:49.209> about<00:01:49.299> this<00:01:49.479> as<00:01:49.629> being

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
that you can think about this as being

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.260 
that you can think about this as being
little<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.259> little<00:01:50.979> B<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.789> guess<00:01:51.969> you<00:01:52.119> can

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
little a little B and I guess you can

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.050 
little a little B and I guess you can
think<00:01:52.299> about<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.780> as<00:01:52.959> being<00:01:52.989> angle<00:01:53.619> C<00:01:54.060> but

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
think about this as being angle C but

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.660 
think about this as being angle C but
the<00:01:55.179> idea<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:56.259> we<00:01:56.379> do<00:01:56.560> all<00:01:57.099> we<00:01:57.159> have<00:01:57.399> to<00:01:57.549> do

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
the idea is what we do all we have to do

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.869 
the idea is what we do all we have to do
is<00:01:57.909> we<00:01:58.090> take<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.869> side<00:01:59.110> we<00:01:59.319> don't<00:01:59.500> know

00:01:59.869 --> 00:01:59.879 
is we take the side we don't know

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:03.600 
is we take the side we don't know
squared<00:02:00.879> and<00:02:01.840> then<00:02:01.959> it<00:02:02.049> says<00:02:02.399> look<00:02:03.399> at<00:02:03.520> the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
squared and then it says look at the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.580 
squared and then it says look at the
formula<00:02:04.060> here

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.219 

so<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> side<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:10.050> do

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
so that's the side we don't know we do

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.320 
so that's the side we don't know we do
know<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> value<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> sides

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
know the value for one of the sides

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.070 
know the value for one of the sides
that's<00:02:12.720> 4.6<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.130> we'll<00:02:14.310> square<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.900> also

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
that's 4.6 so we'll square that we also

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.410 
that's 4.6 so we'll square that we also
know<00:02:16.380> value<00:02:16.920> for<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.670> other<00:02:17.790> side<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.530> 9.3

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
know value for the other side that's 9.3

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
know value for the other side that's 9.3
squared<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.319> take<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:23.099> subtract<00:02:23.580> two

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
squared and then we take we subtract two

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.509 
squared and then we take we subtract two
away<00:02:24.239> again<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.290> multiply<00:02:25.530> those<00:02:26.069> two<00:02:26.310> values

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
away again we multiply those two values

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.809 
away again we multiply those two values
so<00:02:27.209> four<00:02:27.569> point<00:02:27.900> six<00:02:30.769> times<00:02:31.769> nine<00:02:32.130> point<00:02:32.550> three

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
so four point six times nine point three

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.770 
so four point six times nine point three
and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.530> says<00:02:34.769> we<00:02:34.920> take<00:02:35.130> cosine<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.239> that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
and then it says we take cosine of that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.860 
and then it says we take cosine of that
angle<00:02:36.840> which<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.220> case<00:02:38.280> simply<00:02:38.870> 30

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
angle which is in this case simply 30

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.830 
angle which is in this case simply 30
degrees<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.459> now<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.180> not<00:02:42.299> really<00:02:42.600> too

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
degrees so now there's not really too

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.920 
degrees so now there's not really too
much<00:02:43.790> too<00:02:44.790> much<00:02:44.970> left<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.450> other<00:02:45.660> than<00:02:45.780> just

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
much too much left to do other than just

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.980 
much too much left to do other than just
you<00:02:46.709> know<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> bunch<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.330> arithmetic

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
you know just do a bunch of arithmetic

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.260 
you know just do a bunch of arithmetic
okay<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:50.830> let's<00:02:51.160> see<00:02:51.340> here<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> can't<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.210> all

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
okay so let's see here you can't do all

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.070 
okay so let's see here you can't do all
this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.030 

so<00:02:56.650> we've<00:02:56.830> got<00:02:57.010> four<00:02:57.310> point<00:02:57.610> six<00:02:58.020> squared<00:02:59.040> so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
so we've got four point six squared so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.950 
so we've got four point six squared so
four<00:03:00.310> point<00:03:00.550> six<00:03:00.760> squared<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.480> getting<00:03:01.840> that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
four point six squared I'm getting that

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.030 
four point six squared I'm getting that
to<00:03:02.110> be<00:03:02.230> twenty-one<00:03:02.770> point<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.520> six<00:03:03.960> nine

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to be twenty-one point one six nine

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.180 
to be twenty-one point one six nine
point<00:03:06.040> three<00:03:07.230> squared<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.560> getting<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.010> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
point three squared I'm getting that to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.080 
point three squared I'm getting that to
be<00:03:09.340> eighty<00:03:09.670> six<00:03:10.330> point<00:03:10.840> four<00:03:11.470> nine<00:03:11.910> let's<00:03:12.910> see

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
be eighty six point four nine let's see

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.950 
be eighty six point four nine let's see
two<00:03:13.420> times<00:03:13.750> four<00:03:14.350> point<00:03:14.680> six<00:03:15.210> times<00:03:16.210> nine

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
two times four point six times nine

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.570 
two times four point six times nine
point<00:03:17.440> three<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:19.630> going<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.960> be<00:03:20.050> negative

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
point three that's going to be negative

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.230 
point three that's going to be negative
eighty<00:03:21.580> five<00:03:22.090> point<00:03:22.750> five<00:03:23.140> six<00:03:23.940> we<00:03:24.940> know<00:03:24.970> what

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
eighty five point five six we know what

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.930 
eighty five point five six we know what
cosine<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:26.110> 30<00:03:26.800> degrees<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.760> be

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
cosine of 30 degrees is going to be

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.120 
cosine of 30 degrees is going to be
cosine<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.540> 30<00:03:28.840> degrees<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.530> square<00:03:29.830> root

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
cosine of 30 degrees is the square root

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.870 
cosine of 30 degrees is the square root
of<00:03:30.220> three<00:03:30.640> over<00:03:30.850> two<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:33.070> again<00:03:33.310> now<00:03:33.520> just<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
of three over two so again now just a

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.490 
of three over two so again now just a
little<00:03:34.150> bit<00:03:34.270> more<00:03:34.420> simplification<00:03:34.900> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
little bit more simplification so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.030 
little bit more simplification so
twenty-one<00:03:36.010> point<00:03:36.310> one<00:03:36.670> six<00:03:36.970> plus<00:03:37.690> eighty<00:03:38.590> six

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
twenty-one point one six plus eighty six

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.680 
twenty-one point one six plus eighty six
point<00:03:39.430> four<00:03:40.030> nine

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
point four nine

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.420 
point four nine
that's<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.440> be<00:03:42.530> 107<00:03:43.190> point<00:03:43.700> six<00:03:44.210> five

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that's going to be 107 point six five

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.280 
that's going to be 107 point six five
and<00:03:46.430> then<00:03:46.580> let's<00:03:46.790> see<00:03:46.970> here<00:03:47.300> so<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:48.050> can<00:03:48.200> take

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
and then let's see here so we can take

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.740 
and then let's see here so we can take
the<00:03:48.440> square<00:03:48.590> root<00:03:48.860> of<00:03:48.920> three<00:03:49.750> I'm

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
the square root of three I'm

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.020 
the square root of three I'm
approximating<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.770> a<00:03:51.830> little<00:03:52.070> bit<00:03:52.340> we'll

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
approximating this a little bit we'll

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.360 
approximating this a little bit we'll
multiply<00:03:53.210> that<00:03:53.720> by<00:03:53.780> eighty<00:03:54.290> five<00:03:54.590> point<00:03:55.010> five

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
multiply that by eighty five point five

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.760 
multiply that by eighty five point five
six<00:03:56.110> then<00:03:57.110> we'll<00:03:57.230> divide<00:03:57.530> all<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.950> by<00:03:58.130> two

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
six then we'll divide all of that by two

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.950 
six then we'll divide all of that by two
so<00:04:00.770> I'm<00:04:00.860> getting<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.460> be<00:04:01.660> seventy<00:04:02.660> four

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
so I'm getting this to be seventy four

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.980 
so I'm getting this to be seventy four
point<00:04:03.710> oh<00:04:04.070> nine<00:04:04.760> seven<00:04:05.360> so<00:04:05.690> I'm<00:04:05.780> going<00:04:05.930> to

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
point oh nine seven so I'm going to

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.080 
point oh nine seven so I'm going to
round<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.350> point<00:04:06.770> one<00:04:07.160> zero<00:04:07.190> after

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
round that to point one zero after

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.160 
round that to point one zero after
rounding<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.880> we're<00:04:11.030> almost<00:04:11.150> there

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
rounding so we're almost there

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.210 
rounding so we're almost there
so<00:04:12.680> 107<00:04:13.520> point<00:04:13.880> six<00:04:14.570> five<00:04:14.810> minus<00:04:15.560> seventy<00:04:15.950> four

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
so 107 point six five minus seventy four

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.690 
so 107 point six five minus seventy four
point<00:04:16.610> one<00:04:17.030> zero<00:04:18.010> I'm<00:04:19.010> getting<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.580> be

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
point one zero I'm getting that to be

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.200 
point one zero I'm getting that to be
thirty<00:04:20.030> three<00:04:20.450> point<00:04:20.840> fifty<00:04:21.739> five<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.670> now

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
thirty three point fifty five and now

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.700 
thirty three point fifty five and now
all<00:04:23.450> we<00:04:23.630> have<00:04:23.750> to<00:04:23.780> do<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.230> just<00:04:24.380> take<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
all we have to do is just take the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.050 
all we have to do is just take the
square<00:04:25.010> root<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.280> both<00:04:25.430> sides

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
square root of both sides

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.540 
square root of both sides
and<00:04:26.210> we'll<00:04:26.840> have<00:04:26.990> our<00:04:27.050> solution<00:04:27.530> let's<00:04:28.310> see<00:04:28.490> if

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
and we'll have our solution let's see if

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.160 
and we'll have our solution let's see if
we<00:04:28.640> can't<00:04:28.850> just<00:04:28.910> squeeze<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.570> all<00:04:29.690> in<00:04:29.720> here<00:04:30.140> so

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
we can't just squeeze it all in here so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.090 
we can't just squeeze it all in here so
we've<00:04:30.410> got<00:04:30.440> C<00:04:30.860> squared<00:04:31.220> equals<00:04:32.710> thirty<00:04:33.710> three

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
we've got C squared equals thirty three

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.390 
we've got C squared equals thirty three
point<00:04:34.370> 55<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:36.560> again<00:04:36.770> normally<00:04:37.160> for<00:04:37.340> an

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
point 55 so again normally for an

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.250 
point 55 so again normally for an
equation<00:04:37.670> when<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.180> take<00:04:38.360> square<00:04:38.690> roots<00:04:39.020> you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
equation when you take square roots you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.080 
equation when you take square roots you
get<00:04:39.380> positives<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.100> negatives<00:04:40.580> but<00:04:40.820> in<00:04:40.970> this

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
get positives and negatives but in this

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.180 
get positives and negatives but in this
case<00:04:41.300> we're<00:04:41.570> talking<00:04:41.720> about<00:04:41.960> links<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.040> it's

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
case we're talking about links so it's

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.260 
case we're talking about links so it's
certainly<00:04:43.370> going<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.700> have<00:04:43.790> to<00:04:43.940> be<00:04:44.090> the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
certainly going to have to be the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.530 
certainly going to have to be the
positive<00:04:45.110> solution<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.730> the<00:04:46.880> square<00:04:47.180> root<00:04:47.360> of

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
positive solution so the square root of

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.880 
positive solution so the square root of
33<00:04:48.080> point<00:04:48.940> 55<00:04:49.940> I'm<00:04:50.600> getting<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.350> be<00:04:51.470> point

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
33 point 55 I'm getting this to be point

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.720 
33 point 55 I'm getting this to be point
five<00:04:52.370> seven<00:04:53.240> nine<00:04:53.480> after<00:04:54.440> rounding

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
five seven nine after rounding

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.090 
five seven nine after rounding
so<00:04:56.480> that<00:04:56.660> would<00:04:56.780> be<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:57.020> length<00:04:57.230> here<00:04:57.680> of<00:04:57.860> our

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
so that would be the length here of our

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.080 
so that would be the length here of our
angle<00:04:58.630> little<00:04:59.630> C<00:05:00.250> five<00:05:01.250> point<00:05:01.820> seven<00:05:02.420> nine
