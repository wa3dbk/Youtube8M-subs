 milliliters of vanilla essence and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.989
 red dye in gel we extend the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.149
 milk cocoa oil oil juice 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.809
 lemon and vanilla essence the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.040
 bicarbonate vinegar eggs the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.720
 sugar coloring and flour 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.000
 to start the first thing we're going to 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.710
 to do is put the milk in a bowl and 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.710
 let's add the lemon juice 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.879
 we remove it with some rods and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.879
 we reserve 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.110
 On the other hand we are going to mix the cac 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.110
 powder together with the flour 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:26.610
 and once we have it well mixed 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:30.870
 let's sift it and once sifted what 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.570
 we reserve now we take our 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.040
 mixido mixer k we open it we are going to 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.040
 put the splash cap 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.110
 we put the beater utensil and we're going to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.110
 go adding the ingredients 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.910
 so let's add in the glass 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.450
 beater the sugar together with the milk and 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.450
 the two eggs 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360
 and now we are going to beat it at a speed 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 half 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.420
 next we put the option of 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.290
 add ingredients and we're going to add the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.290
 contacted flour 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.690
 and the mixture of milk with lemon and what 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.910
 let's do alternating the words 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.740
 about two teaspoons of flour and a 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.740
 splash of milk with lemon juice 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.520
 when we have added the two 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.970
 ingredients we climb at a speed 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.970
 half 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.629
 while it is mixing we are going to catch 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.569
 a glass and we're going to add the bicarbonate 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.340
 together with the vinegar we mix a 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.230
 little bit with a spoon and as soon as 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.680
 start to bubble we will add it in 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.680
 mix 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.569
 and then we will also add 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.209
 presence of vanilla 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.079
 once we have a homogeneous mixture already 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.079
 we will have it ready 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.510
 now that we have the mixture we have 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.700
 put in a large bowl and we're going to 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.800
 add the red dye gel and I 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.700
 I add little by little so it will be much more 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.700
 easy to mix 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.099
 and with some manual rods we are going to go 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.150
 mixing until getting the color 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.610
 wanted 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.650
 Once we let the desired color 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.209
 to divide the dough into three bowls a 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.280
 equal parts we are left with a 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.230
 bowl and let's look for it in the mold 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.019
 that we have chosen I use a mold 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.540
 of 15 centimeters and we're going to bake it 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.540
 for 50 minutes at 150 degrees 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.680
 when the cake does not burn anymore we're going to 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.560
 unmold what 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.449
 and with the help of a short cakes we are going to 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.580
 cut the top of our 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.470
 cake and so we will eliminate the crust 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.940
 remember that you have to do these 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.940
 steps with the three biscuits 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.630
 As you can see I already have my three discs 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.630
 cut 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.440
 to prepare the next one and for that we are going 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.590
 to need 300 grams of icing sugar 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.840
 150 grams of margarine and 150 grams of 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.340
 cream cheese and here we have the sugar 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.110
 glas and margarine and cream cheese 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.430
 first thing we're going to do is put in 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.370
 unt in silicon beater and then 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.910
 we are going to add the margarine together with the 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.910
 icing sugar 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.320
 Now let's ask for it at a speed 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.470
 low so that the icing sugar does not come out 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.470
 flying 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.000
 and when integrated, we upload it to a 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.100
 pretty high speed when they're 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.900
 well mixed we're going to put the option 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.760
 to add ingredients and let's go 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.760
 adding cream cheese little by little 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.670
 once we have incorporated all the 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.000
 cream cheese we raise the average speed 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.000
 high 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.289
 and when we've got a cream already 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.779
 we will have it ready 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.580
 next we put a base biscuit 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.889
 on the chosen dish and with the help of 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.589
 a refrigerator spoon we are going to add two 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:14.169
 tablespoons of cream and with a spatula 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:17.949
 we deliver it when we have it 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.719
 we put another part of sponge cake and 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.319
 we do the same thing again 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:25.479
 we add two tablespoons of cream and the 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.669
 We distribute all over the cake and 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.200
 we put the last stage of our 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.570
 Biscuit 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.540
 and now let's cover our cake 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.580
 This last layer must be very thin already 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.290
 that we are going to use it as a subject for friends 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.290
 then already beautifying 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.720
 once we have it we are going to 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.639
 enter 30 minutes in the fridge to 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:57.639
 that the frosting hardens 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.639
 directly 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.249
 next we are going to decorate it so 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.709
 I'm going to start at the top 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:07.479
 I'm going to add a lot of cream since I'm going to 

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:09.480
 make a casual effect in the part 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.370
 above 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.160
 and on the sides with the help of a 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.810
 spatula I'll leave it smooth when 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.400
 you have it, we let it cool in the 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:22.350
 fridge 2 hours for you to take 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.570
 consistency and to finish as touch 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.520
 final I have scratched the bases of the sponge cake 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.560
 that they have left me and with the help of a 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.120
 sieved I will sprinkle them by the 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.120
 Top of our layer break 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:46.230
 hello we have here this delicious chasm 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.330
