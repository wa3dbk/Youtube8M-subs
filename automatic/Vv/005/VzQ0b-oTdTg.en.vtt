first<00:00:21.300> we<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.720> redraw<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:23.580> walls<00:00:23.849> on<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
first we have to redraw the walls on the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
first we have to redraw the walls on the
ground<00:00:24.509> plan<00:00:24.830> with<00:00:25.830> our<00:00:26.009> program<00:00:28.160> excluding

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
ground plan with our program excluding

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.530 
ground plan with our program excluding
the<00:00:29.310> doors<00:00:29.550> first<00:00:33.379> for<00:00:34.379> that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.920> use

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
the doors first for that I use

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
the doors first for that I use
rectangular<00:00:36.540> stripes<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:39.230> first<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.559> them

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
rectangular stripes and first put them

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.560 
rectangular stripes and first put them
very<00:00:41.250> rough<00:00:41.809> together

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.390 

the<00:00:46.960> rounded<00:00:47.410> corners<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> little<00:00:48.010> bit<00:00:48.370> a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
the rounded corners a little bit a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.910 
the rounded corners a little bit a
problem<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.450> we<00:00:49.750> have<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.170> change<00:00:50.470> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
problem so we have to change the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.560 
problem so we have to change the
technical<00:00:53.920> way<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.760> constructing<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:57.570> we

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
technical way of constructing and we

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.850 
technical way of constructing and we
have<00:00:58.720> to<00:00:58.900> rework<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.739> walls<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:01.180> be<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.860> little

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
have to rework the walls to be a little

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.510 
have to rework the walls to be a little
bit<00:01:03.070> more<00:01:03.430> detailed<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.750> their<00:01:05.500> position<00:01:06.009> to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
bit more detailed in their position to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.090 
bit more detailed in their position to
the<00:01:06.670> ground<00:01:06.940> plan

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240 

here<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:12.990> move<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
here you can see how we move the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.660 
here you can see how we move the
redrawing<00:01:15.060> ground<00:01:15.509> plan<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> right

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
redrawing ground plan to the right

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.870 
redrawing ground plan to the right
position<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> ground<00:01:19.890> plan<00:01:20.190> is<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
position now the ground plan is a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.530 
position now the ground plan is a
curated<00:01:21.570> enough<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.520> start<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.360> next

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
curated enough so we can start the next

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.880 
curated enough so we can start the next
step<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.850> reconstruction<00:01:27.890> first

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
step of our reconstruction first

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
step of our reconstruction first
changing<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.930> visualization<00:01:30.930> from<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
changing the visualization from the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.380 
changing the visualization from the
ground<00:01:32.009> plan<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.560> three-dimensional<00:01:34.560> view

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
ground plan to a three-dimensional view

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
ground plan to a three-dimensional view
then<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> wall<00:01:37.170> some<00:01:37.619> height<00:01:40.430> then

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
then getting the wall some height then

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
then getting the wall some height then
check<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.090> height<00:01:42.299> by<00:01:43.229> another<00:01:43.830> point<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
check the height by another point of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.960 
check the height by another point of
view<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.060> so-called<00:01:45.590> elevation<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:47.700> see

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
view the so-called elevation and you see

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
view the so-called elevation and you see
the<00:01:48.360> height<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.899> building<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.470> story

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the height of the building one story

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.660 
the height of the building one story
seems<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:51.030> okay<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.460> with

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
seems to be okay so we can go on with

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.719 
seems to be okay so we can go on with
your<00:01:53.759> own<00:01:53.970> construction<00:01:54.539> of<00:01:54.869> our<00:01:55.020> building

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
your own construction of our building

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.930 
your own construction of our building
going<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:57.030> over<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.990> walls<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.429> the

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
going all over the walls so that the

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.410 
going all over the walls so that the
ground<00:02:00.450> level<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.050> our<00:02:01.470> building<00:02:02.210> will<00:02:03.210> be

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
ground level of our building will be

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.120 
ground level of our building will be
finished

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.660 

we<00:02:07.640> don't<00:02:07.820> know<00:02:08.149> how<00:02:08.690> exactly<00:02:09.520> what<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
we don't know how exactly what the

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.000 
we don't know how exactly what the
height<00:02:10.849> of<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.450> building<00:02:11.599> but<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.560> can<00:02:12.770> think

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
height of the building but we can think

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.199 
height of the building but we can think
that<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.849> was<00:02:14.090> around<00:02:14.690> 2<00:02:15.290> meters<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:16.160> 2<00:02:17.000> meter

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
that it was around 2 meters or 2 meter

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.380 
that it was around 2 meters or 2 meter
30<00:02:17.630> up<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.680> 240<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.569> man<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.290> stand

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
30 up to 240 so that a man can stand

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.970 
30 up to 240 so that a man can stand
inside<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.720> building<00:02:24.200> accurately<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:27.800> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
inside the building accurately at the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.940 
inside the building accurately at the
end<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.550> reconstruction<00:02:29.420> step<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.680> can

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
end of this reconstruction step we can

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.210 
end of this reconstruction step we can
check<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:32.209> walls<00:02:32.450> again<00:02:33.190> they<00:02:34.190> all

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
check all the walls again they all

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.289 
check all the walls again they all
closed<00:02:34.730> our<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.230> lines<00:02:38.650> together<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
closed our the lines together is a

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.530 
closed our the lines together is a
elevation<00:02:41.299> okay<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:44.720> go<00:02:44.959> over<00:02:45.519> 4<00:02:46.519> 12<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
elevation okay and can go over 4 12 the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.729 
elevation okay and can go over 4 12 the
next<00:02:47.569> step<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:49.360> reconstruction<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
next step the reconstruction of the

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.630 
next step the reconstruction of the
entrances<00:02:53.110> we<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.230> some<00:02:54.640> archaeological

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
entrances we have some archaeological

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.479 
entrances we have some archaeological
evidence<00:02:55.819> that<00:02:56.660> building<00:02:57.410> door<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:58.130> doors<00:02:58.370> in

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
evidence that building door the doors in

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.650 
evidence that building door the doors in
the<00:02:58.790> buildings<00:02:59.209> were<00:02:59.480> not<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:00.739> high<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:02.420> see

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the buildings were not so high you see

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.020 
the buildings were not so high you see
here<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.200> give<00:03:03.980> them<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.489> height<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.709> nearly<00:03:07.030> 2

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
here I give them a height of nearly 2

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.430 
here I give them a height of nearly 2
meters<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.900> maybe<00:03:09.860> some<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.519> doors

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
meters and maybe some of the doors

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.729 
meters and maybe some of the doors
entrances<00:03:12.440> were<00:03:13.220> only<00:03:14.290> 160<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:17.140> 170<00:03:18.140> meters

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
entrances were only 160 or 170 meters

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.259 
entrances were only 160 or 170 meters
high<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.600> go<00:03:21.049> all<00:03:21.410> over<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.190> building<00:03:22.579> by

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
high so you go all over the building by

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.610 
high so you go all over the building by
creating<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.549> doorways

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.910 

so<00:03:31.159> after<00:03:31.340> why<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.780> complete<00:03:33.260> round

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so after why we have the complete round

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.119 
so after why we have the complete round
plan<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.519> constructed<00:03:35.209> on<00:03:35.659> the<00:03:36.049> base<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
plan we constructed on the base of the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.240 
plan we constructed on the base of the
Popish<00:03:37.730> ground<00:03:38.060> plan<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.950> they're<00:03:39.950> also

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
Popish ground plan and they're also
