00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599

lot to count calories I started using

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.250 
lot to count calories I started using
food<00:00:16.650> zone<00:00:16.949> because<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.240> use<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.660> three

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
with uni stuff anyway but that's just

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.509 
with uni stuff anyway but that's just
too<00:00:21.930> complicated<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.949> doesn't<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.279> enough

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
too complicated and doesn't have enough

too complicated and doesn't have enough
choices<00:00:25.039> um<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> gives<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.500> much

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
choices um but it gives you a much

choices um but it gives you a much
better<00:00:28.740> idea<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.310> what<00:00:30.119> nutrition<00:00:30.779> you're

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

stick to around 1400 calories a day but
certainly<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.860> don't<00:02:21.160> feel<00:02:21.850> bad<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.840> eat

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
certainly I don't feel bad if I eat

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.820 
certainly I don't feel bad if I eat
close<00:02:24.160> up<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> 2,000<00:02:25.060> because<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:26.230> seems<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.710> be

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
close up to 2,000 because it seems to be

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.570 
close up to 2,000 because it seems to be
sort<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.810> leveling<00:02:28.810> out<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.250> overall<00:02:30.250> I'm

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
sort of leveling out and overall I'm

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.120 
sort of leveling out and overall I'm
just<00:02:30.610> slowly<00:02:31.150> losing<00:02:31.810> weight<00:02:32.020> because<00:02:32.740> if<00:02:33.010> I

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
just slowly losing weight because if I

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.720 
just slowly losing weight because if I
ate<00:02:33.360> 1,400<00:02:34.360> calories<00:02:34.480> every<00:02:35.110> day<00:02:35.260> or<00:02:35.890> below<00:02:36.370> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
ate 1,400 calories every day or below I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670 
ate 1,400 calories every day or below I
would<00:02:37.180> drop<00:02:37.510> weight<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.900> crazy<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.530> that's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
would drop weight like crazy but that's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.890 
would drop weight like crazy but that's
not<00:02:38.980> very<00:02:39.220> sustainable<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.360> me<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.750> I'm

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
not very sustainable for me so I'm

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.840 
not very sustainable for me so I'm
pretty<00:02:41.610> flexible<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:45.160> certainly<00:02:45.490> want

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
pretty flexible with it I certainly want

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.100 
pretty flexible with it I certainly want
to<00:02:45.910> lose<00:02:46.060> more<00:02:46.390> weight<00:02:46.570> my<00:02:46.930> next<00:02:47.470> goal<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:48.090> well

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
to lose more weight my next goal is well

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.840 
to lose more weight my next goal is well
my<00:02:50.110> very<00:02:50.740> short-term<00:02:51.130> goal<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:51.490> is<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.700> get

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
my very short-term goal now is to get

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.700 
my very short-term goal now is to get
back<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.270> say<00:02:52.390> any<00:02:52.570> frog<00:02:52.780> where<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.020> was<00:02:53.290> and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
back to say any frog where I was and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.050 
back to say any frog where I was and
then<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:55.480> bigger<00:02:56.350> goal<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.980> get<00:02:57.100> 270<00:02:57.790> that's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
then a bigger goal is to get 270 that's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.300 
then a bigger goal is to get 270 that's
that's<00:02:58.480> been<00:02:58.720> my<00:02:58.960> sort<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.410> major<00:02:59.680> goal<00:03:00.010> for<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that's been my sort of major goal for a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.810 
that's been my sort of major goal for a
long<00:03:00.490> time<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:02.020> get<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.440> 70<00:03:02.770> kilos<00:03:03.130> which<00:03:03.460> on

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
long time is to get to 70 kilos which on

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.200 
long time is to get to 70 kilos which on
me<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:06.310> know<00:03:06.400> don't<00:03:06.670> really<00:03:06.850> look<00:03:06.970> like<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
me is you know don't really look like a

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.680 
me is you know don't really look like a
weight<00:03:07.450> already<00:03:07.810> theory<00:03:08.080> if<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.920> feel

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
weight already theory if I feel

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.930 
weight already theory if I feel
relatively<00:03:10.690> fit<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.350> sort<00:03:11.950> of<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.550> way

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
relatively fit and sort of like the way

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.110 
relatively fit and sort of like the way
my<00:03:13.150> clothes<00:03:13.420> fit<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.050> things<00:03:14.350> like<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.590> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
my clothes fit and things like that and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.150 
my clothes fit and things like that and
I<00:03:16.120> was<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.300> higher<00:03:16.570> weight<00:03:16.870> than<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.200> expected

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
I was a higher weight than I expected

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.800 
I was a higher weight than I expected
because<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> muscle<00:03:19.210> or<00:03:19.330> whatever<00:03:19.600> that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
because I muscle or whatever that

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.650 
because I muscle or whatever that
wouldn't<00:03:20.230> bother<00:03:20.770> me<00:03:21.070> at<00:03:21.220> all<00:03:21.250> weights<00:03:22.090> not<00:03:22.330> a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
wouldn't bother me at all weights not a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.740 
wouldn't bother me at all weights not a
huge<00:03:23.320> issue<00:03:23.560> for<00:03:23.980> me<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:25.180> guess<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.660> just

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
huge issue for me but I guess it's just

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470 
huge issue for me but I guess it's just
something<00:03:26.320> that<00:03:26.770> you<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.520> track<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.390> I

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
something that you can track and I

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.940 
something that you can track and I
certainly<00:03:28.690> don't<00:03:28.990> weigh<00:03:29.200> myself<00:03:29.440> if<00:03:29.800> they're

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
certainly don't weigh myself if they're

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.100 
certainly don't weigh myself if they're
doing<00:03:30.130> anything<00:03:30.550> like<00:03:30.730> that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
doing anything like that

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.230 
doing anything like that
um<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.200> guess<00:03:32.950> weight<00:03:33.250> loss<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.640> certainly<00:03:34.000> not

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
um I guess weight loss is certainly not

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.470 
um I guess weight loss is certainly not
at<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> forefront<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:36.010> my<00:03:36.580> life<00:03:36.820> it's<00:03:37.150> sort<00:03:37.390> of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
at the forefront of my life it's sort of

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.570 
at the forefront of my life it's sort of
slowly<00:03:37.720> happening<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.500> guess<00:03:39.070> what's<00:03:39.370> more

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
slowly happening I guess what's more

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.340 
slowly happening I guess what's more
important<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.120> me<00:03:40.270> is<00:03:40.330> making<00:03:40.660> healthier

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
important to me is making healthier

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.940 
important to me is making healthier
choices<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:43.690> yeah<00:03:43.810> that's<00:03:44.020> my<00:03:44.170> update<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
choices but yeah that's my update and

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:59.339 
choices but yeah that's my update and
I'll<00:03:45.160> show<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.490> how<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.790> can<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.300> have<00:03:47.160> okay

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.220 

and<00:04:00.349> I<00:04:00.470> bought<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.459> dress<00:04:02.120> for<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:02.689> first<00:04:02.870> time

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
and I bought a dress for the first time

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:11.250 
and I bought a dress for the first time
ever<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:06.650> guess<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.549> should<00:04:07.790> show<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:09.939> that's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
ever so I guess I should show you that's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.319 
ever so I guess I should show you that's
I<00:04:12.260> don't<00:04:12.590> know<00:04:12.829> if<00:04:13.340> I'll<00:04:13.549> actually<00:04:13.579> ever<00:04:14.090> bring

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
I don't know if I'll actually ever bring

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.500 
I don't know if I'll actually ever bring
myself<00:04:14.480> to<00:04:14.950> wear<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:17.060> probably

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
myself to wear it you probably

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.390 
myself to wear it you probably
especially<00:04:18.199> without<00:04:18.320> like<00:04:18.650> any<00:04:18.889> covering

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
especially without like any covering

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.779 
especially without like any covering
might<00:04:20.389> like<00:04:20.570> my<00:04:20.720> arms<00:04:21.049> but<00:04:21.229> yeah<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.460> bought<00:04:22.760> a

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
might like my arms but yeah I bought a

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.590 
might like my arms but yeah I bought a
dress<00:04:23.030> for<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.449> first<00:04:23.600> time<00:04:23.900> ever
