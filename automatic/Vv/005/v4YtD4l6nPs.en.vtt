00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.680 

shaft<00:00:41.690> chute<00:00:42.230> made<00:00:42.559> over<00:00:42.800> there<00:00:42.949> on<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.100> side

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.380 

anyway<00:00:47.690> I've<00:00:47.809> got<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.109> carburetor<00:00:48.440> out

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
anyway I've got the carburetor out

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.610 
anyway I've got the carburetor out
Overhaulin<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.749> I<00:00:50.780> was<00:00:50.899> just<00:00:50.929> I<00:00:51.320> just

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
Overhaulin that and I was just I just

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.169 
Overhaulin that and I was just I just
pulled<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.920> flywheel<00:00:52.339> off<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.760> just<00:00:52.969> take<00:00:53.149> a

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
pulled the flywheel off to just take a

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.610 
pulled the flywheel off to just take a
look<00:00:53.359> at<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:53.539> points<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:53.989> they<00:00:54.050> look<00:00:54.230> good<00:00:54.409> I

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
look at the points and they look good I

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.009 
look at the points and they look good I
just<00:00:54.800> give<00:00:55.100> them<00:00:55.159> a<00:00:55.219> little<00:00:55.429> filing<00:00:55.730> just<00:00:56.179> in

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
just give them a little filing just in

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.459 
just give them a little filing just in
general<00:00:58.179> so<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.269> points<00:00:59.600> are<00:00:59.749> right<00:00:59.839> here<00:01:00.199> and

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
general so the points are right here and

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.219 
general so the points are right here and
the<00:01:00.530> coil<00:01:00.829> that<00:01:01.339> sits<00:01:02.120> behind<00:01:02.569> the<00:01:02.780> flywheel

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
the coil that sits behind the flywheel

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.550 
the coil that sits behind the flywheel
so<00:01:04.269> I'll<00:01:05.269> be<00:01:05.390> putting<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.690> back<00:01:05.900> together

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
so I'll be putting that back together

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.500 
so I'll be putting that back together
and<00:01:09.400> picture<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.640> carburetor<00:01:11.060> on<00:01:11.150> there<00:01:11.450> and
