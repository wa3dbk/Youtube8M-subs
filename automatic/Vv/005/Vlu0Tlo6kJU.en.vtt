 Us on the contrary and we do this way 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.580
 it works this part is small 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.619
 triceps is not this but more of this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.850
 because you are straining 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.570
 and you can see even what part of it works 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.960
 how to say if you have problems with 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.199
 elbows 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 if two hands brain this exercise 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.820
 make do with one hand is very nice 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 the elbow does not go much a lot of weight not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 you need 10 to 12 reps I always do 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.229
 3 to 4 approaches this to all my muscles 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.229
 bodies 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.340
 also do not relax when top 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:17.060
 think and when lower strain 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.060
 triceps which is very important 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.690
 feel how triceps work and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.690

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.390

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.050

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.870

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.690
