ado<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.070> thought<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.400> might<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.030> ahead<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
ado I thought we might just go ahead and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
ado I thought we might just go ahead and
do<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.540> quick<00:00:57.840> unboxing<00:00:58.020> first<00:00:58.740> look<00:00:58.950> at

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
do a little quick unboxing first look at

setting on that side flipping over to
the<00:02:42.830> other<00:02:42.950> side<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.520> mono<00:02:43.820> subwoofer

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
the other side this is a mono subwoofer

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.030 
the other side this is a mono subwoofer
output<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.200> you're<00:02:45.350> just<00:02:45.440> going<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.650> have<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
output so you're just going to have the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.830 
output so you're just going to have the
single<00:02:46.460> connections<00:02:47.060> there<00:02:47.300> or<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.750> do

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
single connections there or you can do

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.600 
single connections there or you can do
the<00:02:47.960> mono<00:02:48.140> there<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.590> center<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:49.520> a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the mono there in the center it's just a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.880 
the mono there in the center it's just a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
one channel mono subwoofer output so you

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.950 
one channel mono subwoofer output so you

can see the according down there and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.390 
can see the according down there and
then<00:02:54.260> we've<00:02:54.380> got<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.860> single<00:02:55.190> power

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400
