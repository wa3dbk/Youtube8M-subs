pretty<00:01:49.950> well<00:01:50.040> except<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.090> went<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.840> all

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
pretty well except that we went to all

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
pretty well except that we went to all
this<00:01:52.200> trouble<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.649> make<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> beautiful<00:01:53.189> design

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this trouble to make a beautiful design

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.080 
this trouble to make a beautiful design
and<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.299> cover<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.140> case<00:01:56.090> right

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and we cover it up with this case right

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.469 
and we cover it up with this case right
but<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.110> than<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.850> added<00:01:59.850> thickness

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
but more than that we added thickness

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.100 
but more than that we added thickness
and<00:02:00.750> weight<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> product<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.719> made<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and weight to the product and we made it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.660 
and weight to the product and we made it
more<00:02:04.290> difficult<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
more difficult to use with some of the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.990 
more difficult to use with some of the
accessories<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.069> thought<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.700> could<00:02:08.910> do

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
accessories so we thought we could do

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
accessories so we thought we could do
better<00:02:09.149> than<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.840> ipad<00:02:10.289> 2<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.770> we

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
better than this for ipad 2 and we

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
better than this for ipad 2 and we
started<00:02:11.879> from<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> very<00:02:12.840> beginning

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
started from the very beginning

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.940 
started from the very beginning
to<00:02:13.860> design<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.400> case<00:02:14.959> right<00:02:15.959> alongside<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to design the case right alongside the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
to design the case right alongside the
product<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.319> we<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.560> done<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.790> it's

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
product and we have done that but it's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.990 
product and we have done that but it's
not<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> case<00:02:21.450> anymore<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.620> cover<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.760> cover

when you close it now how is this held
on<00:03:01.550> do<00:03:02.550> we<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.700> some<00:03:03.120> screws<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:04.050> screw<00:03:04.709> in

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
on do we have some screws the screw in

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.090 
on do we have some screws the screw in
what<00:03:06.300> what<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.510> we<00:03:06.600> do<00:03:06.780> no<00:03:07.220> we<00:03:08.220> use<00:03:08.370> magnets<00:03:10.100> our

engineering<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.000> IV<00:03:12.300> team<00:03:12.540> came<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.840> with

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
engineering and IV team came up with

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.309 
engineering and IV team came up with
this<00:03:13.170> idea<00:03:13.319> of<00:03:13.680> using<00:03:13.860> magnets<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.880> grasp<00:03:15.840> it

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
this idea of using magnets that grasp it

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.720 
this idea of using magnets that grasp it
and<00:03:16.640> auto<00:03:17.640> align<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.100> always<00:03:20.340> in

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
and auto align it so it's always in

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.080 
and auto align it so it's always in
perfect<00:03:21.000> alignment<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:22.670> I'll<00:03:23.670> show<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:23.970> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
perfect alignment and I'll show you a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.520 
perfect alignment and I'll show you a
little<00:03:24.269> video<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.930> won't<00:03:25.110> believe<00:03:25.260> it

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
little video this you won't believe it

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.699 
little video this you won't believe it
it's<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.980> cool<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.810> remove<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.620> a

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
it's so cool and you can remove it in a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.229 
it's so cool and you can remove it in a
second<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.610> add<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.030> in<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> second<00:03:32.239> it

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
second you can add it in a second it

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.199 
second you can add it in a second it
adds<00:03:33.540> minimal<00:03:34.260> weight<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.769> thickness

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
adds minimal weight and thickness

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.539 
adds minimal weight and thickness
because<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.420> covering<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.079> top<00:03:37.549> it's

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
because it's just covering the top it's

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.180 
because it's just covering the top it's
got<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.790> microfiber<00:03:39.570> lining<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:40.470> cleans<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
got a microfiber lining that cleans the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.550 
got a microfiber lining that cleans the
screen<00:03:41.549> every<00:03:41.910> time<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.329> move<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.690> open<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.440> or

screen every time you move it open it or

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.630 
screen every time you move it open it or
close<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:44.510> again<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:46.530> automatically<00:03:47.250> wakes

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
close it again it automatically wakes

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.270 
close it again it automatically wakes

unopen puts the iPad to sleep when you
close<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.870> it's<00:03:51.870> really<00:03:52.320> easy<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.950> remove<00:03:53.489> or

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
close it it's really easy to remove or

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.460 
close it it's really easy to remove or
change<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.450> cover<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.049> have<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.200> bunch

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
change the cover so you can have a bunch

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.500 
change the cover so you can have a bunch
of<00:03:55.680> them<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:55.950> pick<00:03:56.579> which<00:03:56.760> cover<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.269> feel

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
of them and pick which cover you feel

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.710 
of them and pick which cover you feel
like<00:03:57.750> today<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.790> easily<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.180> put<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.870> on<00:04:01.700> and

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
like today and easily just put it on and

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.870 
like today and easily just put it on and
they<00:04:03.720> come<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.109> polyurethane<00:04:04.549> which<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.730> used

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
they come in polyurethane which is used

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.069 
they come in polyurethane which is used
to<00:04:06.000> make<00:04:06.180> space<00:04:06.420> suits<00:04:06.720> or<00:04:07.070> leather<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:09.079> so

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
to make space suits or leather and so

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.660 
to make space suits or leather and so
I've<00:04:10.170> got<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.380> little<00:04:10.470> video<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.400> shows

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
I've got a little video that just shows

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.970 
I've got a little video that just shows
you<00:04:11.970> how<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.720> thing<00:04:13.019> works<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.530> let's<00:04:13.769> run

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
you how this thing works and let's run

00:04:13.980 --> 00:05:02.469 
you how this thing works and let's run
that<00:04:14.160> video

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.029 

it's<00:05:03.479> one<00:05:03.659> of<00:05:03.780> my<00:05:03.870> favorite<00:05:04.319> little<00:05:04.560> videos<00:05:04.860> it

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
it's one of my favorite little videos it

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.939 
it's one of my favorite little videos it
actually<00:05:05.400> kind<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.669> reminds<00:05:06.599> me<00:05:06.659> of<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.960> Pixar

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
actually kind of reminds me of a Pixar

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.460 
actually kind of reminds me of a Pixar
short<00:05:08.340> or<00:05:08.490> something<00:05:11.389> but<00:05:12.389> as<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.599> see<00:05:12.930> we

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
short or something but as you see we

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.159 
short or something but as you see we
actually<00:05:14.009> built<00:05:14.400> magnets<00:05:15.180> right<00:05:15.539> into<00:05:16.050> the

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
actually built magnets right into the

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.399 
actually built magnets right into the
iPad<00:05:16.800> itself<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.729> then<00:05:18.389> there's<00:05:18.599> magnets<00:05:19.229> in

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
iPad itself and then there's magnets in

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:22.850 
iPad itself and then there's magnets in
the<00:05:19.560> hinge<00:05:19.919> for<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.340> smart<00:05:20.610> cover<00:05:20.879> and<00:05:21.379> it<00:05:22.379> not

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
the hinge for the smart cover and it not

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.770 
the hinge for the smart cover and it not
only<00:05:22.889> holds<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.729> cover<00:05:23.970> on<00:05:24.180> but<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.539> auto

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
only holds the cover on but it auto

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.219 
only holds the cover on but it auto
aligns<00:05:25.199> it<00:05:25.639> it's<00:05:26.639> really<00:05:27.120> cool<00:05:27.539> and<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:29.430> course

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
aligns it it's really cool and of course

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.869 
aligns it it's really cool and of course
what<00:05:31.229> would<00:05:31.349> these<00:05:31.500> cases<00:05:32.009> be<00:05:32.190> if<00:05:32.400> they<00:05:32.550> didn't

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
what would these cases be if they didn't
