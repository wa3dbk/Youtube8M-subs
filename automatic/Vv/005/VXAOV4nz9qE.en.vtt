welcome<00:00:12.139> to<00:00:12.259> the<00:00:12.349> question<00:00:12.740> of<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:12.919> week<00:00:13.450> this

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
welcome to the question of the week this

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.760 
welcome to the question of the week this
week<00:00:14.690> we'll<00:00:14.959> talk<00:00:15.289> about<00:00:16.450> why<00:00:17.450> my<00:00:18.200> risks<00:00:18.619> are

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
week we'll talk about why my risks are

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.429 
week we'll talk about why my risks are
higher<00:00:19.010> for<00:00:19.599> converting<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.689> lap<00:00:20.900> band<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:21.410> a

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
higher for converting a lap band to a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.660 
higher for converting a lap band to a
gastric<00:00:21.949> sleeve<00:00:23.230> as<00:00:24.230> you<00:00:24.529> know<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:25.039> sleeve<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.640> a

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
gastric sleeve as you know a sleeve is a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.859 
gastric sleeve as you know a sleeve is a
very<00:00:25.939> safe<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:26.570> very<00:00:26.750> effective<00:00:27.500> procedure

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
very safe and very effective procedure

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.810 
very safe and very effective procedure
if<00:00:29.869> you're<00:00:30.109> having<00:00:30.500> weight<00:00:30.679> loss<00:00:30.710> surgery<00:00:30.919> as

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
if you're having weight loss surgery as

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.020 
if you're having weight loss surgery as
an<00:00:32.450> initial<00:00:32.900> procedure<00:00:33.670> but<00:00:34.670> if<00:00:34.820> you're

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
an initial procedure but if you're

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.190 
an initial procedure but if you're
converting<00:00:35.480> from<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.649> previous<00:00:37.309> procedure

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
converting from a previous procedure

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.189 
converting from a previous procedure

higher in a revision surgery is due to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.070 
second approach and in the next few
months<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.580> see<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.330> sleeve<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:39.410> possible

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
months to see if the sleeve is possible

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.759 
months to see if the sleeve is possible
the<00:02:42.080> other<00:02:42.230> factor<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.769> weight<00:02:43.160> loss<00:02:44.769> remember

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
the other factor is weight loss remember

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.839 
the other factor is weight loss remember
that<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.040> band<00:02:46.310> will<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.269> small<00:02:47.690> pouch<00:02:48.849> on

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
that the band will have a small pouch on

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.160 
that the band will have a small pouch on
top<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.450> band<00:02:50.690> where<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:52.180> width<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
top of the band where the width that the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.020 
top of the band where the width that the
food<00:02:54.530> holds<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> while<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.880> then

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
food holds for a while and then

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
food holds for a while and then
digesting<00:02:56.660> them<00:02:56.810> passes<00:02:57.230> down<00:02:57.380> through<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
digesting them passes down through the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.479 
digesting them passes down through the
band<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.700> rest<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> stomach<00:03:00.489> with

band to the rest of the stomach with
time<00:03:01.730> patients<00:03:02.420> may<00:03:03.049> overeat<00:03:03.560> or<00:03:03.950> can<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.370> can

time patients may overeat or can it can

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.630 
time patients may overeat or can it can
be<00:03:04.970> too<00:03:05.180> tight<00:03:05.450> that<00:03:05.780> may<00:03:06.049> cause<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.980> stretched

pouch on top of this on top of the band
patients<00:03:12.769> who<00:03:12.829> would<00:03:12.920> develop<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.549> pouch

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
patients who would develop this pouch

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.050 
patients who would develop this pouch
will<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.410> poor<00:03:15.739> weight<00:03:16.040> loss<00:03:16.310> than<00:03:17.030> a

the<00:03:42.799> average<00:03:43.010> sleeve<00:03:43.459> person<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.310> hope<00:03:46.519> this

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
the average sleeve person so I hope this

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.090 
the average sleeve person so I hope this
clears<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.569> lot<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.900> doubts<00:03:48.079> that's<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.859> for<00:03:49.040> the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
clears a lot of doubts that's it for the
