00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.109
 a quite personalization also of 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:57.190
 16 GB for everything it offers and for 349 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.109
 dollars for the 64GB version not 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.489
 count on them for microsd cards 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:10.150
 I will leave your opinion in the 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:12.700
 comments mine is that the 25 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.000
 and gasset is equal or the xperia cited and 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.650
 however they tell the friendship is a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.300
 golazo mid-year 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.830
 let's say with the rumors this week 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.140
 we started with one that made a lot of noise 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.030
 this week we are talking about who 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.280
 what could stop insisting with this 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.010
 name at least the telephone edition 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.440
 for is to download microsoft mobile first 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.580
 that nothing is just a rumor that this is not 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.650
 no 12-6 made any statement or 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.200
 even the purchase by the 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.580
 May are what it is known that in 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.010
 the offices will continue to be in 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.050
 Finland but such with a subsidiary 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.450
 from microsoft I really hope this 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.150
 do not be so please make this false 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.910
 For wickedness of a man who is 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.750
 the worst move that microsoft can do 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:02.160
 in my opinion I do not think of china where 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 be without killing 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 that was a lot back to the company all the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.770
 world 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.310
 whatever it is but you have a certain 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.310
 security you are buying 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.440
 trust you can leave your messages of 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.670
 You can leave your requests to Stephen Elop 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.670
 to explain it please follow 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.040
 existing samsung models is the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 samsung application that is called 65 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.330
 we can see that the list of terminals 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.200
 which supports this application is we see the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.900
 do not 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.970
 4 the successor of the name would be done with a 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 rough screen for another but we have 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.459
 rumors of galaxy s 5 prime a version 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.500
 even more premium if you want to leave the 75 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.230
 that already presented understood chips 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.750
 exynos with rn with 8 cores as it did 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.230
 great there is 4 had four cores 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.960
 cortex a15 to 2.173 and four cores 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.860
 cortex well 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.500
 it also has a resolution hd the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.740
 asset roles of a benchmark of the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 possible success would have a processor 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.080
 snapdragon 800 a screen of 5.2 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.880
 inches with resolution full hd two 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.160
 gigabytes of I'm going to give a camera of 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.860
 12 megapixels and 32 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.260
 internal let's hope that all this comes 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.200
 with and functionality not in love 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.000
 to all with the original ex engine to go 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.190
 ending we are going to talk about timple 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.140
 these are four small buttons that 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.500
 stretch to the device housing 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.180
 android that has nfc yes or yes and what 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.280
 do is this current we're going to encrypt four 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.430
 more buttons that allow us to do things 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 take pictures open an application open to 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.130
 take action whatever this project is 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.020
 to launch in Indiegogo on May 4 at a 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.050
 price just below 30 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.160
 dollars can enter more in 3.1 want 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.000
 so we end with the application 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.970
 seasonal 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.030
 just how can you look for the curves 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.830
 easily fate and ft is an application 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.660
 which makes connecting services or 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.760
 applications for example we have a 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.830
 recipe that has a thriller or a 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.290
 unchained that causes a song 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.510
 an action for example a photo is taken 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.700
 to instagram that would be the trigger 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.830
 strident and produces an action that is 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.230
 for example, upload it to twitter or 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.270
 facebook something but easier to water 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.520
 check in on foursquare and what it does is 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.680
 send a message to such a person 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.690
 I'm whole we're not applications very 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 interesting very good recent 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.040
 simple and reaches a comment what they 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.040
 It seems 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.060
 you know why did not come nicolÃ¡s 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:55.000
 miley you did not subscribe 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.929
 If only one is wrong, we are all wrong 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.929
 carat 

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:59.929
 two
