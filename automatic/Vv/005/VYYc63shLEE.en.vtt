00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
parts and you mix them together to form

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.230 
parts and you mix them together to form
a<00:00:25.710> em<00:00:26.449> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> plastic<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.789> plug<00:00:30.060> the

of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> windows<00:01:18.470> because<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.820> windows

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
of the windows because if the windows

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.859 
of the windows because if the windows
are<00:01:21.450> exposed<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> case<00:01:23.040> um<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:24.630> not

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
are exposed as in this case um they not

are exposed as in this case um they not
under<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> Eve<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.750> water<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.170> run<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
under a Eve the water will run down and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.910 
under a Eve the water will run down and
pull<00:01:31.310> basically<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> corners<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.920> it'll

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
pull basically in the corners and it'll

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
pull basically in the corners and it'll
seep<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> edge<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> wood<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:38.750> it'll

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
seep into the edge of the wood and it'll

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
seep into the edge of the wood and it'll
it'll<00:01:40.079> basically<00:01:40.350> cause<00:01:40.950> rock<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it'll basically cause rock which you

to see if the panes bubble a little bit

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.389 
to see if the panes bubble a little bit
discolored<00:01:55.939> if<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.829> then<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.009> need<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
discolored if it is then you need to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.600 
discolored if it is then you need to
really<00:01:59.729> remove<00:02:00.259> all<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.799> completely

wood that you've just cleared of of rot

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.460 
wood that you've just cleared of of rot
you<00:02:37.780> dry<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.110> out<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.590> when<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> put<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
you dry it out so that when you put the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.010 
you dry it out so that when you put the
adhesive<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:44.170> BA<00:02:44.380> get<00:02:44.440> up<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:46.360> it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
adhesive on and you you BA get up it it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.320 
adhesive on and you you BA get up it it
sticks<00:02:47.500> properly<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:48.850> stall<00:02:49.120> weight

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
sticks properly if it was stall weight

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:27.360 
sticks properly if it was stall weight
it<00:02:49.510> wouldn't<00:02:49.780> stick<00:02:49.990> properly

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.900 

just<00:03:27.970> get<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.360> everywhere

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:47.470 

brought<00:03:32.270> up<00:03:32.600> nicely

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.250 

all<00:03:48.480> right<00:03:48.659> over<00:03:48.900> here

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
all right over here

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.039 
all right over here
I've<00:03:50.159> basically<00:03:51.120> dried<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.629> up<00:03:51.780> with<00:03:51.959> a

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
I've basically dried this up with a

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.380 
I've basically dried this up with a
paint<00:03:52.260> gun<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:53.400> afterwards<00:03:53.970> I've<00:03:54.180> gone

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
paint gun and then afterwards I've gone

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.420 
paint gun and then afterwards I've gone
over<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.900> I've<00:03:54.989> removed<00:03:55.440> all<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.830> loose<00:03:56.040> dry

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
over and I've removed all the loose dry

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.280 
over and I've removed all the loose dry
wood<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.180> then<00:03:57.510> I've<00:03:57.599> gone<00:03:57.780> over<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.140> with

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
wood and then I've gone over it with

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.470 
wood and then I've gone over it with
pancan<00:03:58.769> again<00:03:59.040> you're<00:03:59.280> probably<00:03:59.760> just<00:04:00.180> able

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
pancan again you're probably just able

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.720 
pancan again you're probably just able
to<00:04:00.659> see<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:00.989> video<00:04:01.159> that<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.280> paint<00:04:02.519> gun

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
to see on the video that the paint gun

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.149 
to see on the video that the paint gun
is<00:04:02.940> actually<00:04:03.120> burnt<00:04:03.840> this<00:04:04.110> wood<00:04:04.409> slightly<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
is actually burnt this wood slightly and

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.759 
is actually burnt this wood slightly and
that's<00:04:05.220> not<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.489> bad<00:04:05.730> thing<00:04:06.030> because<00:04:06.209> um<00:04:06.769> when

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
that's not a bad thing because um when

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.360 
that's not a bad thing because um when
you<00:04:07.890> burn<00:04:08.099> wood<00:04:09.590> basically<00:04:10.590> all<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.920> Tenon's

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
you burn wood basically all the Tenon's

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.430 
you burn wood basically all the Tenon's
and<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:12.060> set<00:04:12.299> comes<00:04:12.599> out<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.799> forms<00:04:14.250> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
and the set comes out and it forms a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.439 
and the set comes out and it forms a
hard<00:04:16.440> barrier<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.250> outside<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:18.209> that

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
hard barrier on the outside so that

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.229 
hard barrier on the outside so that
would<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.840> perfect<00:04:19.049> term<00:04:19.650> for<00:04:20.609> us<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.940> put<00:04:21.120> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
would be perfect term for us to put the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.490 
would be perfect term for us to put the
feather<00:04:21.449> on<00:04:23.360> okay<00:04:24.360> now<00:04:24.630> I'm<00:04:24.750> going<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.020> mix<00:04:25.199> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
feather on okay now I'm going to mix the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.150 
feather on okay now I'm going to mix the
filler

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
filler

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.750 
filler
this<00:04:27.030> comes<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.419> two<00:04:27.570> parts<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:29.100> main<00:04:29.280> part<00:04:29.639> is

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
this comes in two parts the main part is

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.909 
this comes in two parts the main part is
this<00:04:29.940> white<00:04:30.150> stuff<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.810> then<00:04:31.050> you've<00:04:31.710> got<00:04:31.889> a

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
this white stuff and then you've got a

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.820 
this white stuff and then you've got a
little<00:04:32.160> container<00:04:32.639> of<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.150> red<00:04:33.389> stuff<00:04:33.830> the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
little container of this red stuff the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.070 
little container of this red stuff the
container<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:36.030> red<00:04:36.180> stuff<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.780> basically

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
container of the red stuff is basically

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.950 
container of the red stuff is basically
the<00:04:37.500> hardener<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:41.250> what<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.729> want<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.970> do<00:04:42.180> is

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
the hardener so what you want to do is

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.200 
the hardener so what you want to do is
just<00:04:43.770> add<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.039> little<00:04:44.250> bit<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.729> red<00:04:44.850> stuff

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
just add a little bit of the red stuff

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.719 
just add a little bit of the red stuff
and<00:04:45.780> then<00:04:46.199> mix<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.710> really<00:04:46.740> well<00:04:47.039> you<00:04:47.580> only

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
and then mix it in really well you only

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.570 
and then mix it in really well you only
make<00:04:48.000> up<00:04:48.210> enough<00:04:48.830> for<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.950> immediate<00:04:50.340> hold

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
make up enough for the immediate hold

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.770 
make up enough for the immediate hold
that<00:04:50.700> you're<00:04:50.849> going<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.030> fill<00:04:51.240> as<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.510> stuff

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
that you're going to fill as the stuff

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.860 
that you're going to fill as the stuff
dries<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.349> about<00:04:52.590> ten<00:04:53.460> minutes<00:04:53.570> probably<00:04:54.570> even

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
dries in about ten minutes probably even

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.300 
dries in about ten minutes probably even
a<00:04:54.990> bit<00:04:55.110> less<00:04:56.030> say<00:04:57.030> five<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.479> ten<00:04:57.690> minutes<00:04:58.310> all

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
a bit less say five to ten minutes all

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.710 
a bit less say five to ten minutes all
right<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.639> mix<00:04:59.880> this<00:05:00.000> up<00:05:00.180> really<00:05:00.419> well<00:05:00.660> and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
right of mix this up really well and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.050 
right of mix this up really well and
it's<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.080> pink<00:05:01.320> color<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.830> ready<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.340> be<00:05:02.760> put

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
it's a pink color it's ready to be put

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.860 
it's a pink color it's ready to be put
into<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.539> gap<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.169> going<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.440> fall<00:05:04.680> now

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
into the gap that it's going to fall now

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.740 
into the gap that it's going to fall now
all<00:05:06.870> right<00:05:07.110> now<00:05:07.169> I'm<00:05:07.530> going<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.860> apply<00:05:08.599> to<00:05:09.599> the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
all right now I'm going to apply to the

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.610 
all right now I'm going to apply to the
hole<00:05:14.120> right<00:05:15.120> two<00:05:15.510> or<00:05:15.690> three<00:05:15.990> minutes<00:05:16.199> later

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
hole right two or three minutes later

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.300 
hole right two or three minutes later
and<00:05:17.270> we<00:05:18.270> can<00:05:18.479> check<00:05:18.750> to<00:05:18.810> see<00:05:19.130> whether<00:05:20.130> it's

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
and we can check to see whether it's

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.120 
and we can check to see whether it's
hardened<00:05:20.729> sufficiently<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.630> be<00:05:21.660> cut<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:25.130> it

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
hardened sufficiently to be cut and it

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.460 
hardened sufficiently to be cut and it
looks<00:05:26.430> like<00:05:26.669> it<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:27.570> pretty<00:05:27.990> much<00:05:28.050> almost

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
looks like it is pretty much almost

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.640 
looks like it is pretty much almost
there<00:05:29.120> need<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.150> leave<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:30.660> for<00:05:30.690> a<00:05:30.930> little<00:05:31.229> bit

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
there need to leave it for a little bit

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.620 
there need to leave it for a little bit
longer<00:05:31.860> just<00:05:32.340> to<00:05:33.300> get<00:05:33.449> hard<00:05:33.660> enough<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.110> cut

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
longer just to get hard enough to cut

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.339 
longer just to get hard enough to cut
say<00:05:36.630> another<00:05:36.900> minute<00:05:37.260> or<00:05:37.349> two<00:05:38.570> all<00:05:39.570> right<00:05:40.110> it's

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
say another minute or two all right it's

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.200 
say another minute or two all right it's
dried<00:05:40.620> sufficiently<00:05:41.310> now<00:05:41.580> so<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.060> it's

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
dried sufficiently now so that it's

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.439 
dried sufficiently now so that it's
bonded<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.960> wood<00:05:43.610> now<00:05:44.610> the<00:05:44.669> next<00:05:45.060> step<00:05:45.270> is

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
bonded to the wood now the next step is

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.570 
bonded to the wood now the next step is
to<00:05:45.810> use<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.440> Stanley<00:05:46.979> knife

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
to use a Stanley knife

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.520 
to use a Stanley knife
and<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:48.630> carefully<00:05:50.300> trim<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.450> so<00:05:51.720> that<00:05:52.410> it

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
and to carefully trim it so that it

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:10.460 
and to carefully trim it so that it
matches<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:53.810> profile<00:05:54.810> of<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.080> window<00:06:09.470> okay

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
matches the profile of the window okay

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.620 
matches the profile of the window okay
and<00:06:10.620> as<00:06:10.710> you<00:06:10.920> can<00:06:11.160> see<00:06:11.340> I've<00:06:11.580> pulled<00:06:12.510> this<00:06:12.750> up

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
and as you can see I've pulled this up

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.480 
and as you can see I've pulled this up
and<00:06:15.630> I've<00:06:15.750> matched<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.230> profile<00:06:16.710> as<00:06:16.980> best<00:06:17.280> I

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
and I've matched the profile as best I

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.960 
and I've matched the profile as best I
could

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
could

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.990 
could
if<00:06:18.630> this<00:06:18.900> was<00:06:19.110> in<00:06:19.320> an<00:06:19.440> area<00:06:19.650> that<00:06:19.800> was<00:06:19.950> going<00:06:20.910> to

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
if this was in an area that was going to

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.880 
if this was in an area that was going to
be<00:06:21.120> seen<00:06:21.420> that's<00:06:21.810> on<00:06:22.050> top<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.260> the<00:06:22.470> roof<00:06:22.680> here

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
be seen that's on top of the roof here

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.440 
be seen that's on top of the roof here
so<00:06:23.160> it's<00:06:23.310> quite<00:06:23.460> far<00:06:23.760> away<00:06:23.880> from<00:06:24.000> everything

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
so it's quite far away from everything

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:31.820 
so it's quite far away from everything
you'd<00:06:25.410> sand<00:06:25.770> it<00:06:26.010> down<00:06:27.200> one<00:06:28.200> more<00:06:28.230> tip<00:06:28.860> is<00:06:29.070> I<00:06:30.830> cut

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
you'd sand it down one more tip is I cut

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.000 
you'd sand it down one more tip is I cut
a<00:06:31.860> groove<00:06:32.190> in<00:06:32.940> there<00:06:33.420> and<00:06:33.990> because<00:06:34.890> that's

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
a groove in there and because that's

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.580 
a groove in there and because that's
where<00:06:35.250> two<00:06:35.580> pieces<00:06:36.000> of<00:06:36.030> wood<00:06:36.300> meet<00:06:36.570> or<00:06:37.050> would

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
where two pieces of wood meet or would

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.800 
where two pieces of wood meet or would
have<00:06:37.740> met<00:06:37.980> and<00:06:38.250> by<00:06:38.940> cutting<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.360> groove<00:06:39.510> in

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
have met and by cutting a groove in

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.960 
have met and by cutting a groove in
there<00:06:40.050> with<00:06:40.860> a<00:06:40.890> sanding<00:06:41.430> I've<00:06:41.550> what<00:06:41.850> will

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
there with a sanding I've what will

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.150 
there with a sanding I've what will
happen<00:06:42.270> is<00:06:42.420> when<00:06:42.990> this<00:06:43.140> window<00:06:43.500> gets<00:06:43.770> hot<00:06:43.980> and

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
happen is when this window gets hot and

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.110 
happen is when this window gets hot and
expands<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.960> filler<00:06:46.200> won't<00:06:46.440> crack<00:06:46.890> or<00:06:47.160> rather

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
expands the filler won't crack or rather

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.350 
expands the filler won't crack or rather
it<00:06:48.390> will<00:06:48.930> form<00:06:49.320> a<00:06:49.440> small<00:06:49.710> line<00:06:50.010> where<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.180> wood

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
it will form a small line where the wood

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.360 
it will form a small line where the wood
would<00:06:51.510> have<00:06:51.630> been<00:06:51.840> so<00:06:52.770> that'll<00:06:53.010> stop<00:06:53.220> the

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
would have been so that'll stop the

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.060 
would have been so that'll stop the
fuller<00:06:53.550> from<00:06:53.730> cracking
