00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
see the light is now coming through and

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.710 
see the light is now coming through and
there's<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.610> big<00:00:20.850> sort<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.180> thick<00:00:21.449> layer<00:00:21.690> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
there's a big sort of thick layer of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.800 
there's a big sort of thick layer of
trouble<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> bottom<00:00:22.680> there<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.810> according

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
trouble at the bottom there so according

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.750 
trouble at the bottom there so according
to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> wheel<00:00:25.109> code<00:00:25.410> instructions<00:00:26.160> basically

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
to the wheel code instructions basically

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.929 
to the wheel code instructions basically
the<00:00:26.880> mixed<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:28.020> bottle<00:00:28.650> this

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
the mixed thing to do is to bottle this

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.950 
the mixed thing to do is to bottle this
straight<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.359> may<00:00:30.420> join<00:00:30.630> into

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
straight out that they may join into

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.530 
straight out that they may join into
course<00:00:31.170> port<00:00:31.470> once<00:00:31.680> but<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.369> after<00:00:33.239> sod<00:00:33.420> I'm

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
course port once but and after sod I'm

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000 
course port once but and after sod I'm
going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.870> game<00:00:34.140> because<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> did<00:00:34.650> that<00:00:34.800> last

box so the only thing that's left to do
now<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.670> give<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.360> try<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.970> tap

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
now is for me to give this a try the tap

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:15.500 
now is for me to give this a try the tap
as<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:57.750> sort<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:58.110> security<00:02:58.710> tab<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:14.510> she's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
as a little sort of security tab a she's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.479
