I<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:29.669> made<00:00:29.879> by<00:00:30.059> world<00:00:30.329> tech<00:00:30.660> toys<00:00:32.000> basically

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
I was made by world tech toys basically

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.110 
I was made by world tech toys basically
it's<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.920> single<00:00:35.309> rotor<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> whole

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it's it's a single rotor but the whole

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720 
it's it's a single rotor but the whole
thing<00:00:36.480> spins<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.590> don't<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.100> understand

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
thing spins I don't really understand

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.189 
thing spins I don't really understand
quite<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> works

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
quite how it works

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.220 
quite how it works
but<00:00:40.890> as<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.309> flying<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.600> alien<00:00:43.079> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
but as it's flying this the alien is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.010 
but as it's flying this the alien is
spinning<00:00:43.590> around<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.130> well<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.750> got

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
spinning around as well and it's got

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
spinning around as well and it's got
LEDs<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.810> it<00:00:48.989> gives<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.620> pretty<00:00:49.739> cool

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
LEDs in it so it gives a pretty cool

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.720 
LEDs in it so it gives a pretty cool
light<00:00:50.340> show<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.970> LEDs<00:00:51.450> spinning<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.730> but

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
light show with LEDs spinning around but

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.729 
light show with LEDs spinning around but
there<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.390> no<00:00:54.630> control<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
there there is no control really you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.780 
there there is no control really you
just<00:00:55.920> give<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.220> a<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.450> and

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
just give it a you know on and off and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.240 
just give it a you know on and off and
when<00:00:59.790> you<00:00:59.910> tell<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.360> go<00:01:00.540> it<00:01:01.079> flies<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
when you tell it to go it flies up for a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.969 
when you tell it to go it flies up for a
while<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.880> then<00:01:03.540> comes<00:01:03.870> back<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
while and then comes back down and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
while and then comes back down and
sensors<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:05.820> hand<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> ground<00:01:06.899> or

press<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.450> off<00:01:15.569> button<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:17.399> problem<00:01:17.789> is<00:01:17.909> is

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:18.209 
press the off button the problem is is

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:20.179

that<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.569> can't<00:01:18.840> fly<00:01:19.109> it<00:01:19.170> indoors<00:01:19.679> at<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.159> I

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that I can't fly it indoors at all I

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.830 
that I can't fly it indoors at all I
mean<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> instruction<00:01:21.209> manual<00:01:21.479> said<00:01:21.689> it's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
mean the instruction manual said it's

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.649 
mean the instruction manual said it's
supposed<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.139> fly<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.679> like<00:01:22.709> three<00:01:23.219> feet<00:01:23.659> but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
supposed to fly up like three feet but

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
supposed to fly up like three feet but
it<00:01:25.649> hits<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> ceiling<00:01:26.399> every<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> try

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it hits the ceiling every time I try

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
it hits the ceiling every time I try
I've<00:01:28.020> tried<00:01:28.319> it<00:01:28.469> outside<00:01:28.859> once<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.639> it<00:01:29.759> went

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I've tried it outside once and it went

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.739 
I've tried it outside once and it went
maybe<00:01:30.299> 30<00:01:30.869> feet<00:01:31.319> up<00:01:31.880> before<00:01:32.880> coming<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.450> down

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:33.749 
maybe 30 feet up before coming back down

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.129 
maybe 30 feet up before coming back down
so<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:36.179> really<00:01:36.600> know<00:01:36.749> if<00:01:36.899> mine's

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139
