00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.129
 Hello to all boxing fans, this is Dmitry 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.459
 Moses and as part of their god take off 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.320
 blog, I always hurry to share 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:19.090
 your thoughts on those fights 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.820
 who passed this morning that is 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:27.079
 heavyweight pain between tyson 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.169
 fury from chick x-ray and just gorgeous 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.320
 shooter fight between Alvarez himself and his 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.690
 Central there in general, then the pain if you 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.270
 I can stop you especially, I do not 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.270
 I will 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.490
 predictable saw fury in general 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.130
 justified 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.090
 most prediction won 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.840
 knockout 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.750
 but if we say so go into 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.890
 details he won is not at all like 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.130
 waited on him and in general the whole class 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.060
 determined by 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.060
 these moments 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.900
 about a year ago I probably had 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.140
 the release of the framework of the blog where I tell 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.909
 about heavyweight avenues there in 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 Yuri called one of the most 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.759
 promising prospectus notes this 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 the moment that he is not bad to work on 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.990
 protection has passed a year 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.670
 and now there giving her 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.070
 deserves himself some good bugs and he 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.940
 discuss largely due to their language 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.060
 but with such protection go against it 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.610
 skillful fighter with good 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.590
 dimensions imagine if you trade 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.340
 spank he missed from the same kris 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.289
 arreola 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.270
 or satomi man of course oh well 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.690
 proceed in general to fight for 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.369
 which installation and write down a small 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.369
 alvarez review 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.120
 now sure boxing is enough for him a little 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.820
 fights that are well advertised 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 who are promoted but which is essentially 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:29.110
 affairs outside bear some good 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.810
 sports component kind of odds 50 on 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.570
 50 great example here coming 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.709
 fighting and home in the hall that is yes there is a bunch 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.579
 issues he will collect a good cash all in 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.290
 including me 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:47.500
 we will watch this fight but for good 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.560
 hero chances not so much in a fight allmax 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.950
 trout odds really were 5050 this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.440
 the latter doubted the same to give 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.930
 preference in general yesterday rules on 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.220
 one of the sites its forecast that after all 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.820
 victory of almaris on points and wrote more 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.540
 115 112 and 116 12 but in general, because 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.170
 knockdown one more 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.049
 I did not guess, but if everything was like that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.840
 I want to mention the fight 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.939
 absolutely met all expectations that is 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.310
 it was really competitors very 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.469
 intense fighting for those who love the hand 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.439
 maybe this is not what you need because 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.480
 that I have already seen my group in general 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.799
 expressed that the battle is boring what was up 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.939
 sky stress 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:39.439
 discharge we are sorry all tastes are different 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:42.079
 for me this is exactly what you need about 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.540
 touched want to say he's done well 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:48.200
 the fact that he lost think this fight 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.810
 he won a lot of new fans 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.239
 He showed that he is excellent technically 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.359
 boxer and in general is a defeat 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.760
 strong and now thinks not to throw back 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.129
 that is, he will get new chances 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.150
 if he did everything right champion 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.030
 he will be still 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.909
 but of course the hero today is not he and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 after all salon about Alvares 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.979
 can say the following in his 22 years 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.820
 this guy is really demonstrating 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:21.799
 the fact that he is a very adult held 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.650
 fighter before i perceived him as 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.139
 a shirt that goes forward to its 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.550
 a bunch of punches and trying to crush your 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.010
 rival due to the huge amount 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:37.070
 he beats the fact that he has a strong head 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.430
 last battle throwing counted their opuses 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.000
 on the beggar of past fights he was so 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.280
 today i saw the one that he was 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.440
 so because we allow ourselves to be 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.340
 so he understood that missing a beat 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.770
 nothing terrible will strike 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.470
 before head rivals he will get this 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.830
 effect which min 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.310
 dinner today understood that against him 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.050
 fighter of a completely different level and he was 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.510
 completely different he was cool 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.510
 weigh he did not go ahead and on 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.160
 my opinion he led the fight on the field 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.470
 trout opponent higher 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.390
 morning at the length of the arm, respectively 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.110
 it would seem that long distances are more profitable 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.540
 he could hold his nose 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.640
 admit he did fine almost 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.770
 not as a counter punch and that is a 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.890
 waiting for the action to be touched 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.930
 then threw his punch and 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:39.370
 punches were very effective now 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.530
 Of course I will show this one Trump loves 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.960
 throws out her so not then 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.990
 I live to the end does not unbend 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.730
 Saul throws away from him 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.560
 reacts 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.390
 leans back and already flies back 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.510
 or g or forehand and in sonul 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.370
 very interesting jack i.e. if the trawl 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.150
 really just throws out 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.610
 biting 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.050
 thoughts jackman of course is left handed that is 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:11.530
 james it right but there is a jeep owl 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.740
 what it is like it pre-exposes 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:18.460
 arm and all body flies forward like 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.320
 Superman blacks in general, this is Jack 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.330
 we are really close to us 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.960
 State aid shook well 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:30.910
 I really want to mention for the battle 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.120
 the moment you sent the grass you 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.190
 sometimes he is most like boxers 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.310
 did then rushes on finishing off 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.380
 Herbs really was shocked by the nose and 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.320
 here showed kakuetu his helmet 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.830
 adulthood he calmly assess the situation and 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.660
 I put something to force further 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:52.720
 continued to score points to increase his 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.450
 advantage in general today I will not say 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.200
 that album became my favorite fighter not 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.820
 so would 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.460
 we are useful now not now 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:07.420
 matters and he remains to them but the salon 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:13.090
 surely opened for me with some 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.780
 new side well done do i see him 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:20.200
 fight for already in the next fight 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:24.280
 perhaps that yes that is alvarez large 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.680
 he has physical strength he enters 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.860
 total weight that is not beneficial to my 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.830
 in winter, the troops are still not worth it 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.480
 rise above average weight but also 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.830
 could go super welterweight 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.130
 rise for this fight 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:43.210
 and I think there is in general, then I think 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:45.670
 he will win better than boys on you is difficult 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.460
 will find because dating with 

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:51.970
 all those whom nature has gone time type 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.680
 Alexander Khan do not know you understand 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.170
 more seriously like most 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.350
 boxing fans alvarez 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.180
 this is exactly the opponent for which 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.850
 will say that my we easily stuffed 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.730
 pockets and earns money and this 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:11.580
 really good sports challenge i 

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.580
 I see very bad chances at saule
