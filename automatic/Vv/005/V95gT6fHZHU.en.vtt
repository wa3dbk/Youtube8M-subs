it<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.640> next<00:02:46.940> step<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.590> winning<00:02:48.860> step

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
it the next step is as the winning step

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.060 
it the next step is as the winning step
which<00:02:49.819> is<00:02:50.120> when<00:02:50.750> they<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.170> how<00:02:51.440> they<00:02:51.620> separate

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
which is when they is how they separate

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:05.920 
which is when they is how they separate

step in removing the shell from the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.789 
step in removing the shell from the
kernel<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.360> by<00:03:08.570> manually<00:03:09.140> doing<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.530> by<00:03:09.620> hand

kernel is by manually doing it by hand

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.470 
kernel is by manually doing it by hand
by<00:03:10.040> picking<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.489> one<00:03:10.670> by<00:03:10.820> one<00:03:11.060> they're

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
by picking it one by one they're

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.940 
by picking it one by one they're
organized<00:03:12.019> like<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.650> width<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:14.739> beef<00:03:15.739> you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
organized like the width it and beef you

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.220 
organized like the width it and beef you
can<00:03:16.030> removing<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.180> shell<00:03:17.390> nut<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.900> live<00:03:18.079> in

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
can removing the shell nut and live in

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.949 
can removing the shell nut and live in
the<00:03:18.350> shell<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.980> next<00:03:25.220> step<00:03:25.400> after<00:03:25.959> they

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the shell the next step after they

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.080 
the shell the next step after they
separate<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.560> nuts<00:03:27.739> from<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.160> British<00:03:28.940> shell

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
separate the nuts from the British shell

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.199 
separate the nuts from the British shell
from<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.299> kernel<00:03:29.660> they<00:03:30.530> dry<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.130> for<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.850> second

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
from the kernel they dry it for a second

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:40.330 
from the kernel they dry it for a second
time<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> next<00:03:38.420> step<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:39.590> firstly

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
time the next step is to firstly

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.599 
time the next step is to firstly
separate<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.120> goodness<00:03:41.480> in<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.810> bed<00:03:41.959> nets<00:03:42.200> so

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
separate the goodness in the bed nets so

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.520 
separate the goodness in the bed nets so
so<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.730> ones<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.120> are<00:03:44.239> black<00:03:44.450> they<00:03:44.930> they

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
so the ones that are black they they

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.190 
so the ones that are black they they
discard<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.390> they<00:03:47.510> can<00:03:47.690> increase<00:03:47.989> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
discard so so they can increase the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:56.160 
discard so so they can increase the
quality<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.739> button

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.839 

and<00:03:57.040> then<00:03:57.549> they<00:03:57.730> pound<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:59.189> mache<00:04:00.189> Nets<00:04:00.430> into

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
and then they pound the mache Nets into

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:13.259 
and then they pound the mache Nets into
small<00:04:01.060> pieces<00:04:01.239> so<00:04:01.659> they<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.469> then<00:04:02.590> fry<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:12.269> and

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
small pieces so they can then fry it and

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.499 
small pieces so they can then fry it and
so<00:04:13.510> now<00:04:13.689> they<00:04:13.870> are<00:04:14.400> taking<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.700> crack<00:04:16.209> nuts

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:16.509 
so now they are taking the crack nuts

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.020 
so now they are taking the crack nuts
and<00:04:16.780> they<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.650> taking<00:04:18.099> them<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.579> get<00:04:18.789> fried

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
and they are taking them to get fried

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.379 
and they are taking them to get fried
where<00:04:19.840> they<00:04:20.049> take<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.310> cracked<00:04:21.639> nuts<00:04:21.820> and

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
where they take the the cracked nuts and

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.870 
where they take the the cracked nuts and
they<00:04:23.289> put<00:04:23.590> them<00:04:23.680> on<00:04:23.800> fire<00:04:24.039> and<00:04:24.370> they<00:04:24.580> fry<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
they put them on fire and they fry it

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.060 
they put them on fire and they fry it
while<00:04:25.180> stirring<00:04:25.479> continuously<00:04:25.919> they<00:04:26.919> can

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
while stirring continuously they can

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.339 
while stirring continuously they can
tell<00:04:27.250> when<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.610> done<00:04:27.789> when<00:04:28.630> they<00:04:28.810> put<00:04:29.199> water

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
tell when it is done when they put water

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.379 
tell when it is done when they put water
on<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:29.949> can<00:04:30.039> hear<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.580> scheanette

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
on it and it can hear the scheanette

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:38.610 
on it and it can hear the scheanette
sizzle<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.300> next<00:04:37.449> step<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:38.110> grinding

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
sizzle so the next step is a grinding

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.730 
sizzle so the next step is a grinding
step<00:04:38.919> and<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:39.900> they<00:04:40.900> have<00:04:41.020> three<00:04:41.229> methods<00:04:41.620> of

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
step and so they have three methods of

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.820 
step and so they have three methods of
grinding<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:43.449> first<00:04:43.720> method<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.229> using<00:04:44.590> a

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
grinding the first method is using a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.089 
grinding the first method is using a
mortal<00:04:45.190> and<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:45.580> pestle<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.570> pounding<00:04:46.990> it

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
mortal and a pestle and just pounding it

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.230 
mortal and a pestle and just pounding it
until<00:04:48.099> they<00:04:48.250> get<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:48.970> is<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
until they get it to the this is the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.980 
until they get it to the this is the
suit<00:04:49.419> if<00:04:49.539> you<00:04:49.570> want<00:04:57.090> then<00:04:58.090> they<00:04:58.449> also<00:04:58.630> have<00:04:58.960> a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
suit if you want then they also have a

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.230 
suit if you want then they also have a
method<00:04:59.500> where<00:04:59.680> they<00:04:59.800> use<00:04:59.979> a<00:05:00.009> stone<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.699> large

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
method where they use a stone a large

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.670 
method where they use a stone a large
stone<00:05:01.509> and<00:05:01.720> they<00:05:01.930> put<00:05:02.139> it<00:05:02.229> on<00:05:02.289> there<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.590> they

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
stone and they put it on there and they

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.720 
stone and they put it on there and they
grind<00:05:02.979> it<00:05:03.099> using<00:05:03.580> another

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
grind it using another
