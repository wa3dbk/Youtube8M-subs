00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.420
 of a recipe 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.580
 dear to me and dear to my heart 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.730

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.060
 necessarily and I wanted to put in 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.170
 exergue this product make it smoke all 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.300
 what is smoked marry very well at 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.900
 purchase the purchase of the mountains which is the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.900
 wild service 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.820
 I wanted to associate in one bite all 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.770
 these elements so was but the acidity 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 of the apple let go of the mountains and the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.520
 Ferroof eric jacquet smoke by itself 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.340
 by the way and the potato so in 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.690
 iran we made a ravioli so there 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.810
 the idea was to make fine 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.210
 slices of potatoes cut in the 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.290
 Mandolin is what we all have at the gym 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.310
 and a little bit of olive oil on it 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.360
 for not that she sticks because there we 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:00.400
 will pop starch there we season 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.089
 before cooking the potatoes and 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.350
 I'm going to cook for 55 seconds 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.240
 then at home it will be the coolest 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.390
 candles that could take five 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.159
 minutes later in the whipped cream 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 so we have some mistakes and cream 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.250
 beforehand I put a pinch of salt 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.180
 I put the green pole 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.180
 I'm going to put everything 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:32.110
 m to the smoking time and yet 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.979
 purchasing mountains I'm going to put a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.229
 zest of lemon of the year and a round of 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.680
 pepper mill to bring some 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.030
 mince was cut into carpaccio 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.250
 sphere to smoke can put below 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 of the plate and after we go the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.530
 present 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.290
 so here it sounds so there the apples of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.040
 earth are cooked that we see them 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.899

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:10.750
 ravioli here is the device 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.410
 I put it in my pocket so recipes very 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.730

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.480
 two starred restaurants get complicated at 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.189
 then we will take an apple from 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.189
 earth to slide on it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 so we go the pass is slightly the 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.640
