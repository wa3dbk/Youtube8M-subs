hair up into a beehive in the middle and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.149 
hair up into a beehive in the middle and
I<00:01:13.790> left<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.240> perimeter<00:01:14.810> out<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.380> far<00:01:18.649> I<00:01:18.710> have

the<00:01:19.190> back<00:01:19.549> half<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:20.090> my<00:01:20.210> perimeter<00:01:20.630> complete<00:01:21.350> I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.430 

will<00:01:25.940> not<00:01:26.119> be<00:01:26.299> braiding<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:26.899> hair<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:27.409> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
will not be braiding this hair all the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.980 
will not be braiding this hair all the
way<00:01:27.680> down<00:01:27.830> I'm<00:01:28.789> only<00:01:29.060> going<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.509> braiding

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
way down I'm only going to be braiding

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.260 
way down I'm only going to be braiding
maybe<00:01:30.289> four<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.740> six<00:01:31.009> inches<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.700> then<00:01:32.060> I'm

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
maybe four to six inches and then I'm

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:41.200 
maybe four to six inches and then I'm
going<00:01:32.539> to<00:01:32.600> slip<00:01:32.990> knot<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.500> hair<00:01:39.220> as<00:01:40.220> I<00:01:40.850> stated

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
going to slip knot the hair as I stated

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.230 
going to slip knot the hair as I stated
before<00:01:41.470> because<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:43.100> silky<00:01:43.670> or<00:01:43.880> shiny

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
before because it is not silky or shiny

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.020 
before because it is not silky or shiny
you<00:01:45.080> can<00:01:45.289> grip<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.069> easily

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
you can grip it so easily

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.559 
you can grip it so easily
it<00:01:47.750> just<00:01:48.170> gives<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.649> very<00:01:49.039> natural<00:01:49.819> full

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
it just gives you a very natural full

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.050 
it just gives you a very natural full
look<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:52.039> know<00:01:52.190> how<00:01:52.429> when<00:01:52.670> you're<00:01:52.789> grabbing

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
look you know how when you're grabbing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.600 
look you know how when you're grabbing
for<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> hair<00:01:53.840> no<00:01:54.500> matter<00:01:54.649> how<00:01:55.009> much<00:01:55.250> hair<00:01:55.580> you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
for the hair no matter how much hair you

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.450 
for the hair no matter how much hair you
grab<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.020> begin<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.560> braid<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.429> hair

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
grab as you begin to braid the hair

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.539 
grab as you begin to braid the hair
appears<00:01:59.179> to<00:01:59.390> be<00:01:59.509> thin<00:01:59.890> well<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.069> this<00:02:01.280> one

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
appears to be thin well with this one

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.149 
appears to be thin well with this one
it's<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.060> total<00:02:02.479> opposite<00:02:03.020> because<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.979> can

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
it's the total opposite because you can

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.669 
it's the total opposite because you can
grab<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.429> small<00:02:04.850> amount<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.479> still<00:02:06.350> come<00:02:06.649> out

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
grab a small amount and still come out

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.690 
grab a small amount and still come out
with<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.069> nice<00:02:07.340> full<00:02:07.909> braid<00:02:09.250> once<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.429> are<00:02:10.549> done

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
with a nice full braid once you are done

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.610 
with a nice full braid once you are done
braiding<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.269> hair<00:02:11.299> around<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.989> perimeter

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
braiding the hair around the perimeter

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.680 
braiding the hair around the perimeter
next<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:13.670> will<00:02:13.820> start<00:02:14.150> on<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:14.360> latch

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
next you will start on the latch

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.350 
next you will start on the latch
searching<00:02:15.170> process<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:16.549> basically<00:02:17.060> you're

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
searching process so basically you're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.870 
searching process so basically you're
just<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> crochet<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.530> hair<00:02:18.739> onto<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
just going to crochet the hair onto the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.840 
just going to crochet the hair onto the
braided<00:02:20.299> beehive<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.109> the<00:02:21.320> middle<00:02:21.620> again<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
braided beehive in the middle again you
