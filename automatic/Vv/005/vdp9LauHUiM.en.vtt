a<00:02:07.409> PNG<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.209> JPEG

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
a PNG is because if you have like a JPEG

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.540 
a PNG is because if you have like a JPEG
um<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.640> doesn't<00:02:11.940> mask<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.900> background

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
um it doesn't mask out the background

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.650 
um it doesn't mask out the background
which<00:02:14.140> its<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.310> can<00:02:16.670> find<00:02:17.090> ways<00:02:17.360> to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
which its if you you can find ways to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.840 
which its if you you can find ways to
get<00:02:17.840> rid<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> background<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:19.160> normal

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
get rid of the background in a normal

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.120 
get rid of the background in a normal
picture<00:02:20.180> but<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.870> definitely<00:02:21.410> not<00:02:21.710> as<00:02:21.890> clean

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
picture but it's definitely not as clean
