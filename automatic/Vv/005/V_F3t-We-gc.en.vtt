because<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.250> worth

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
because I don't really think it's worth

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.399 
because I don't really think it's worth
putting<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.909> money<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.570> plastics<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
by them so the next obvious question is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
by them so the next obvious question is
well<00:01:43.350> who<00:01:43.560> are<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.399> find

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
out which is another option because it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.199 
out which is another option because it
is<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.610> cool<00:02:05.820> machine<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:08.209> think

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
