the<00:00:08.040> blade<00:00:08.310> uses<00:00:08.880> four<00:00:09.270> LF<00:00:09.900> drivers<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.620> we've

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
the blade uses four LF drivers and we've

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.799 
the blade uses four LF drivers and we've
completely<00:00:11.370> redesigned<00:00:11.760> them<00:00:12.210> compared<00:00:12.690> to

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
completely redesigned them compared to

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.589 
completely redesigned them compared to
the<00:00:12.900> ones<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.260> used<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> concept<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.599> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the ones we used on the concept and the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.450 
the ones we used on the concept and the
reason<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.139> did<00:00:16.290> that<00:00:16.349> is<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.680> wanted<00:00:17.099> an<00:00:17.220> even

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
reason we did that is we wanted an even

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.269 
reason we did that is we wanted an even
better<00:00:17.670> level<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> bass<00:00:18.540> performance

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
better level of bass performance

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.320 
better level of bass performance
compared<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.610> were<00:00:20.640> getting<00:00:20.820> before

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
compared to what we were getting before

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.170 
compared to what we were getting before
and<00:00:21.599> in<00:00:22.470> redesigning<00:00:23.310> them<00:00:23.490> we've<00:00:23.670> included

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and in redesigning them we've included

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.260 
and in redesigning them we've included
some<00:00:24.570> new<00:00:24.600> technologies<00:00:25.470> which<00:00:26.160> help<00:00:27.150> us

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
some new technologies which help us

some new technologies which help us
attain<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.810> level<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.199> performance<00:00:28.710> for
