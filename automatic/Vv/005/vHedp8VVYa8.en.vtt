well<00:02:23.340> all<00:02:24.239> admits<00:02:24.569> not<00:02:24.840> being<00:02:25.080> completely<00:02:25.769> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
well all admits not being completely you
know<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:27.030> knowledgeable<00:02:27.750> about<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.200> theory

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
know as knowledgeable about the theory

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
know as knowledgeable about the theory
however<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.209> principle<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> theory

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
however that the principle of the theory

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.070 
however that the principle of the theory
I<00:02:31.170> honestly<00:02:31.950> think<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:33.480> sort<00:02:34.019> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
I honestly think it's it's sort of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.199 
I honestly think it's it's sort of
symptomatic<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.890> having<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.549> narrative<00:02:35.879> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
symptomatic of having a narrative that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.610 
symptomatic of having a narrative that
doesn't<00:02:36.629> quite<00:02:36.840> answer<00:02:37.110> every<00:02:37.590> single

doesn't quite answer every single

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.250 
doesn't quite answer every single

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
leave more room for that I that's that's

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.250 
leave more room for that I that's that's
totally<00:03:20.849> fair<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:21.389> I<00:03:21.450> think<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> reason<00:03:22.049> why

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
totally fair but I think the reason why

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.780 
totally fair but I think the reason why
the<00:03:22.319> fans<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:22.769> upset<00:03:22.919> about<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.519> ending

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the fans are so upset about the ending

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.970 
the fans are so upset about the ending
is<00:03:23.970> because<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.870> was<00:03:25.139> very<00:03:25.410> clearly<00:03:25.859> defined

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
is because it was very clearly defined

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.530 
is because it was very clearly defined
this<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.579> going<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:26.910> be<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.090> end<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.480> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540

promise and that's what happens it's not

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.900 
promise and that's what happens it's not
it's<00:03:51.030> no<00:03:51.180> different<00:03:51.389> than<00:03:51.630> with<00:03:52.079> chow<00:03:52.260> skis<00:03:52.590> or

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
that's a very great example with the

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.809 
that's a very great example with the
matrix<00:03:55.500> absolutely<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.160> know<00:03:56.280> they<00:03:56.519> got<00:03:56.669> to

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
matrix absolutely you know they got to

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.449

these journeys into a satisfactory close

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.339 
these journeys into a satisfactory close
and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.239> think<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.540> they<00:04:03.629> probably<00:04:03.840> struggle

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
and I think that they probably struggle

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.229 
and I think that they probably struggle
with<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:04.560> question<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.010> lot<00:04:05.040> they<00:04:05.760> did<00:04:05.970> an

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
with this question a lot they did an

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.809 
with this question a lot they did an
admirable<00:04:06.540> job<00:04:06.900> of<00:04:07.579> attempting<00:04:08.579> to<00:04:08.579> pull

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
admirable job of attempting to pull

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.670 
admirable job of attempting to pull
those<00:04:08.970> things<00:04:09.209> together<00:04:09.359> with<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.199> statues

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
those things together with the statues

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.229 
those things together with the statues
that<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:10.980> talked<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.790> way<00:04:11.910> up<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.120> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
that you talked to on the way up to the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.300 
that you talked to on the way up to the
final<00:04:12.540> confrontation<00:04:12.859> but<00:04:13.859> i<00:04:13.919> think<00:04:14.220> they

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
final confrontation but i think they

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.589 
final confrontation but i think they
dropped<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.699> ball<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.060> i<00:04:15.120> think<00:04:15.329> that<00:04:15.480> the

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
dropped the ball and i think that the

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.729 
dropped the ball and i think that the
the<00:04:15.840> sad<00:04:16.019> truth<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.320> we<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.470> wanna<00:04:16.680> believe

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
the sad truth is we don't wanna believe

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.500 
the sad truth is we don't wanna believe
they<00:04:16.949> dropped<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> ball<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:18.359> weren't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
they dropped the ball but they weren't

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.969 
they dropped the ball but they weren't
able<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.780> pull<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.109> across<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.470> finishing

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
able to pull it across the finishing

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.680
