00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
only when we're going from the overall

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
only when we're going from the overall
to<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.920> nether

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.590 

let's<00:03:49.900> see<00:03:50.140> what<00:03:50.260> happens<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.360> we<00:03:52.450> were<00:03:52.570> just

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
let's see what happens so we were just

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.430 
let's see what happens so we were just
there<00:03:52.990> we<00:03:53.170> know<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.500> was<00:03:53.920> loaded<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:58.440> and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
there we know that was loaded but and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:07.110 
there we know that was loaded but and
there<00:03:59.710> it<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:02.610> started<00:04:03.610> out<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:03.880> we<00:04:04.000> go<00:04:06.120> dying

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
there it is started out here we go dying

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.510 
there it is started out here we go dying
again

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.780 

so<00:04:13.150> there's<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.570> information

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.930 

definitely<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> bug
