00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.500
 4 is a day 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.500
 It is not to be water conscious 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.790
 Something but Masu final too Tei your body, such as to find a hand 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.030
 7 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 Hmm 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.360

 Explanation of Keio's Anatomy Body 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 In the case of the face, that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.320
 Respect accidental punch to the body But there is that the opponent falls down in the helicopter is a difference in the play 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.780
 Be obvious 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:29.800
 In addition, you can clearly see the other party with your own awareness and hear the sound of the venue 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.290
 In such a situation you can not fight anymore though you want to fight 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.570
 I am very satisfied in that respect 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.570
 Not in the technology that the difference of competence will come out clearly 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.630
 It is Anatomy lower part of Oshin Kei 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:52.759
 It is recently dare, such as lower without saying a low Keck 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.189
 Not only Lower Mercy, but Valerie kicks to the lower one and then by Masashi Behind 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:04.659
 Such various receive the thigh at a deformation of it Noriyuki inferior vena Dosu or Kato investment in the heel 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.659
 It is technology that has been referred to as the original return you hear in various forms has made now evolution 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.720
 I shot the lower body cp 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 Hip then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.940
 This thigh bone has grown from the hip joint, but it is also 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.390
 If the pelvis was so triangular in this way 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:30.160
 The hips grow so much that they are spread outside once and spread out behind 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.390
 Stretches down 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.260
 Legs that I have with the foot after we are actually behind tide 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.780
 I'm growing up then go outside 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.240
 Then from inside to outside 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.440
 In such Fu 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:53.920
 Running is the structure of the large feeding bone 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.920
 I would like to introduce another picture of ct's photo
