00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:08.350
 the river is very nice 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 in japan also well landscape 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 Yes now 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.810
 cargo train 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 bands of curves and sounds between lane and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 wheel 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.470
 how long 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.860
 and here it looks like a toy 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.600
 and green are the ones that are similar 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.019
 to those greens to that gas pipeline 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.019
 interesting 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:14.080
 then everyone will connect for 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.080
 connect the electricity 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.040
 later on the herbs 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.240
 it's very interesting that they deduce themselves 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.920
 non-touristic hp roads 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 they are used for industry too 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.319
 the only railroad in the republic 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.319
 mexican 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.880
 since we donated before there was a hand 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.610
 veracruz 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.709
 it would be found and there is another one that is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.760
 merely tourist distant here the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.720
 list tequila well sis 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720
 the one of guadalajara 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600
 how are we going to appreciate the train is going to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.360
 enter the penalty tunnel was going to 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.360
 extend to the second level if your circle 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.080
 this third level 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.770
 I guess now you're traveling with 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.770
 destination to the mochis 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.180
 and some of the time it is transported 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.820
 wood that is pine we have here to 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.550
 pines station a new file towards 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.040
 the mochais sinaloa culiacÃ¡n for a 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.040
 later manufacture furniture like this 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 baby goat furniture factory 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:45.210
 in the pines throughout this mountain region 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.210
 and from there they transport and remove wood
