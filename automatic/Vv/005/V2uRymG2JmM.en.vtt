00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.150
 Road racer of 2013 model 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 It is introduction of 1.5 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:17.650
 Here is the impact from the road surface in the rich aluminum frame + carbon fork carbon 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:23.330
 Absorbency is very good 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:27.760
 As the handle tongue bites and absorbs slight vibrations coming in 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.760
 It is why are the sometimes comfortable as riding a long distance 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 Though it is this frame 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:44.330
 Unlike the 1 series frame up to 2012 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.330
 The frame used in the 2012 2 series is used as it is 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:56.040
 Because 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:56.040
 For example , it has become a very neat frame without such partial welding marks 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.590
 Yes Yes 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.590
 It is a driving system 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.050
 There are 10 front 2 sheets back 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.420
 Nokia 's island will be the race 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.420
 Crank set is using the things of fsa 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.829
 str ever are also using the Tiagura 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.580
 Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, I use a series frame. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 The brakes are also about other companies' products now 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.930
 Not a long arch 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 105 Artegra 0 as etc 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.700
 Thing is to be happy possible to put this It is normal of the brake arch 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 Also class of over - eating on the by say ten law to be applied to the here 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:06.720
 I think that it is relatively easy to upgrade up because there are 10 pairs 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:08.619
 In that sense, lower class 1.1 1.2 is nine -speed, so put out your budget if possible 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.310
 I wonder if better to choose here is not it a give 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.310
 I think Nante Na 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.770
 It was explanation of yes more than 1.5 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:29.190
 Last but not least 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:32.060
 Click here for frame size was 50 cm at 9.2 km 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.060
 that's all
