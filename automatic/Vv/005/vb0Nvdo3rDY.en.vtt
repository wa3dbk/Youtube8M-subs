panel<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:19.459> don't<00:04:20.459> remember<00:04:20.580> if<00:04:21.000> I'm

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
panel up I don't remember if I'm

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.910 
panel up I don't remember if I'm
spoiling<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> instructions<00:04:22.290> but<00:04:22.440> that's<00:04:22.770> the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
spoiling the instructions but that's the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.180 
spoiling the instructions but that's the
way<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.310> i<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:25.080> position<00:04:25.530> all<00:04:25.740> these

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
way that I i like to position all these

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.880 
way that I i like to position all these
panels<00:04:26.550> here<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.350> looks<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.590> little<00:04:28.710> bit

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
panels here so it looks a little bit

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.260 
panels here so it looks a little bit
cool<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:31.170> I<00:04:31.410> like<00:04:31.800> here<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.520> back<00:04:32.760> of<00:04:32.940> truck

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270

cool and I like here the back of truck
look<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.110> way<00:04:35.660> okay<00:04:36.660> next<00:04:36.870> step<00:04:37.170> will<00:04:37.590> be

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
look in that way okay next step will be

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.610 
look in that way okay next step will be
to<00:04:37.940> separate<00:04:38.940> here<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:40.050> windows<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.560> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
to separate here the windows and the

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
and rotate this one and here we don't

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.120 
and rotate this one and here we don't
have<00:04:59.580> any<00:04:59.820> cannon<00:05:00.150> there's<00:05:01.110> work<00:05:01.260> where<00:05:01.770> we're
