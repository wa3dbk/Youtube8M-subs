00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.880 
so Rubbermaid bento containers are
really<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.989> able<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> prep<00:00:55.500> provide

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
really going to be able to prep provide
a<00:00:55.920> great<00:00:56.250> solution<00:00:56.579> something<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
a great solution something that they can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
a great solution something that they can
feel<00:00:57.870> good<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.079> leaving<00:00:58.410> out<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:58.980> also

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
feel good about leaving out but also

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.010 
feel good about leaving out but also
will<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.670> able<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> stay<00:01:00.090> organized<00:01:00.510> over<00:01:00.750> time

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
will be able to stay organized over time

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
will be able to stay organized over time
so<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.829> at<00:01:01.920> inside<00:01:02.250> these

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so if you look at inside these

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
so if you look at inside these
containers<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.210> they've<00:01:03.510> become<00:01:03.660> cluttered

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
containers here they've become cluttered

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
containers here they've become cluttered
and<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.519> solution<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and so it's really not a solution so I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.840 
and so it's really not a solution so I
think<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> colors<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> sizes<00:01:08.520> will

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
think with all the colors and sizes will

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.219 
think with all the colors and sizes will
be<00:01:08.970> able<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> offer<00:01:09.330> we're<00:01:09.659> gonna<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.049> to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.880 
and I've noticed that they've given each
child<00:03:07.360> their<00:03:07.540> own<00:03:07.660> been<00:03:07.930> with<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.650> little
