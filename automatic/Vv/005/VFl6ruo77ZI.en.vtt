 a little bit more of flavor in the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.720
 scenario and the most important thing that we are 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.460
 obedient to the strict classes that 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710

 Yes sir 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.920
 and if they tell you that it began lasting in the 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.640
 truth and the cure that I am looking for 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.239
 actually 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.890
 Although knowing how to sing something has to 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.450
 singing is better than a lie to me 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.080
 Mother 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.790
 nothing else 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 daily and often but what was 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.810
 living without you

 although sometimes it scares me 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:47.200
 despair when we go to the route and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.940
 despair is if they tell me that I 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 I'm healing in the truth and future that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:01.260
 fantasies games when you arrive although you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.530
 last small days that involve those of the day 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.120
 It's worth more than your lie that filled me 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:14.210
 of anger and nothing else will be to my bitterness 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:20.080
 to the gentleman is that sometimes you give me 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.080
 in this way 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.819

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.690

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.659
 a thirst 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.250
 Thanks Alberto to accompany Paquito

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.800
 keeping I think it's for you 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:05.379
 favor me has used me beyond 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.199
 some detunements with a little bit of 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:12.809
 life of lyrics but to me I have you 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.809
 and that voice I have recordings 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.880
 good thank you very much to our 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.490
 electorate for joining us in helping 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.770
 here to frankie ruiz tonight at the 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.230
 that all the participants are going to 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.580
 have reinforcements of great artists of 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.410
 all seasons of them today like this 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.750
 that does not take off because there's going to be 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:33.210
 many more surprises today today 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.370
 day and I will emphasize what I have come 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.380
 saying I feel that they are looking to be 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.420
 less percussive and more melodic and that's 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.190
 important I think that today has been a 

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.800
 step more in that sense avoiding the 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.009
 exit 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.720
 that's fine but watch that also you 

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.580
 can remove a little bit of brightness and a 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.680
 little bit of joy you have to start 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.900
 where you give him a new 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.280
 little bit of nose and where it goes back to 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.500
 remove I think you have to go measuring 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.139
 so that we do not go completely 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.370
 do one more thing pop and less to be what 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:02.370
 who is looking for there
