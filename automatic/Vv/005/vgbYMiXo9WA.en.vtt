00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
first we're going to start with the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.819 
first we're going to start with the
boxing<00:00:37.640> jab<00:00:37.930> stands<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:39.110> little<00:00:39.260> bit<00:00:39.470> low<00:00:39.620> it's

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.090 
hand on the other side and goes fast up
boom<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:46.190> is<00:00:46.250> one<00:00:47.379> so<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.470> jab<00:00:48.680> comes<00:00:48.920> from

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
boom this is one so the jab comes from

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.420 
boom this is one so the jab comes from
low<00:00:49.519> and<00:00:49.820> comes<00:00:50.540> straight<00:00:50.870> up<00:00:50.930> boom<00:00:51.860> this<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.370> a

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
low and comes straight up boom this is a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.910 
low and comes straight up boom this is a
fast<00:00:52.699> jab<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.269> usually<00:00:54.050> we<00:00:54.379> use<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.769> to

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
fast jab and usually we use it to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.329 
fast jab and usually we use it to
measure<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.220> distance<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:56.830> little<00:00:57.830> bit<00:00:58.070> deeper

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
measure the distance a little bit deeper

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.160 
measure the distance a little bit deeper
the<00:00:58.460> feet<00:00:58.790> are<00:00:58.970> a<00:00:59.000> little<00:00:59.210> bit<00:00:59.299> turned<00:00:59.780> it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
the feet are a little bit turned it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.079 
the feet are a little bit turned it
needs<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.470> little<00:01:00.589> bit<00:01:00.710> more<00:01:00.799> turned<00:01:01.250> in<00:01:01.400> so

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
needs a little bit more turned in so

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.910 
needs a little bit more turned in so
you're<00:01:02.269> here<00:01:02.479> so<00:01:02.689> the<00:01:03.170> jab<00:01:03.439> here<00:01:03.680> comes

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
you're here so the jab here comes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.020 
you're here so the jab here comes
naturally<00:01:04.339> from<00:01:04.759> down<00:01:05.750> here<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.259> up<00:01:06.770> here<00:01:07.130> you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
naturally from down here to up here you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.670 
naturally from down here to up here you
see<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.810> boxing<00:01:09.140> jab<00:01:09.229> should<00:01:09.530> hit<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
see so the boxing jab should hit a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.679 
see so the boxing jab should hit a
little<00:01:09.950> bit<00:01:10.040> with<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.369> upper<00:01:11.210> part<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
little bit with the upper part of the

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.780 
little bit with the upper part of the
knuckles<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.500> comes<00:01:12.710> from<00:01:12.799> here<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.280> it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
knuckles so it comes from here and it

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.230 
knuckles so it comes from here and it
moves<00:01:13.909> up<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.340> this<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.610> way<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:16.790> hit<00:01:17.119> it

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
moves up so this is the way you hit it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.160 
moves up so this is the way you hit it
for<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.320> part<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.710> knuckles<00:01:20.110> Basia<00:01:21.110> is

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
for this part of the knuckles Basia is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.170 
for this part of the knuckles Basia is
good<00:01:21.350> it's<00:01:21.500> fast<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.430> for<00:01:22.610> kickboxing<00:01:22.909> is

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
good it's fast but for kickboxing is

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.819 
good it's fast but for kickboxing is
dangerous<00:01:23.600> because<00:01:23.869> somebody<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.560> attack

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
dangerous because somebody can attack

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.469 
dangerous because somebody can attack
you<00:01:24.950> with<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.220> with<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.520> low<00:01:25.729> kick<00:01:25.909> they<00:01:26.270> kick

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
you with it with a low kick they kick

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.499 
you with it with a low kick they kick
your<00:01:26.630> leg<00:01:26.780> really<00:01:27.289> easy<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.850> then<00:01:28.850> for

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
your leg really easy and then for

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.510 
your leg really easy and then for
kickboxing<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.109> not<00:01:30.229> good<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:30.619> for<00:01:31.189> kickboxing

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520

busy and measure this is at the same
time<00:02:09.580> for<00:02:10.580> MMA<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> even<00:02:11.840> bigger

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
time for MMA that this is even bigger

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.280 
time for MMA that this is even bigger

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.020 
more like a uppercut jab consumed here
the<00:02:48.359> thumb<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.719> up<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.530> goes<00:02:49.739> fast<00:02:50.010> boom<00:02:50.489> for

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the thumb is up it goes fast boom for

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.940 
the thumb is up it goes fast boom for
under<00:02:51.390> two<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.319> one<00:02:52.560> more<00:02:54.469> when<00:02:55.469> somebody<00:02:55.799> as<00:02:55.920> a

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
under two up one more when somebody as a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.640 
under two up one more when somebody as a
has<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.489> defense<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:57.389> he's<00:02:57.689> up<00:02:58.019> up<00:02:58.349> here

so it's a little bit over for me from

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.530 
so it's a little bit over for me from
the<00:03:00.810> inside<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.829> comes<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.219> from<00:03:02.370> boom<00:03:03.030> it's

the inside so it comes up from boom it's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.259 
the inside so it comes up from boom it's
not<00:03:03.750> an<00:03:03.840> uppercut<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.579> really<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.939> jab

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
not an uppercut is it's not really a jab
