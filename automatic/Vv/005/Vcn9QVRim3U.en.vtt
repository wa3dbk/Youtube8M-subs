00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello rule over the river forehead 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.770
 when you first start 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.110
 bodybuilding you need a man 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.830
 which will insure you approaches and 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.230
 be your partner on the coach but I 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.020
 takes many years I have such a man 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.060
 principle does not intend therefore we can brave 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.060
 and for starting to train deltas 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.040
 No, but this footcloth is no good 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.020
 why does he have such a long towel for me 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.720
 like 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 output one and a half problem will be 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:09.550
 solved completely different thing 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 you know in training on the delta I 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.180
 try to put the main focus on 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 rear beam 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 what exactly does he give shoulder 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.800
 ball and makes him the amount of today all 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.860
 toning we will stick to the scheme 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.180
 where the focus will go on the back bunch and 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.330
 first movement we work mahi 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.509
 super series 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.520
 with a crossover let's start for 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.590
 of our first move make we take 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.020
 dumbbells face value of 20 6 kilograms and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.899
 working in such a heavy power mode 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.869
 we do three approaches and to the questions why 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:49.450
 we combine two such movements will explain 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.420
 having heavy exercise of course 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.740
 develops white muscle fibers which 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.690
 responsible for the volume and the presence of exercise with 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.119
 small working weight on a large number 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 reps to the end yes this is an emphasis on 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.180
 red muscle fibers and how 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.290
 both types of muscle fibers we 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.780
 working at the same time what else 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.470
 first of all gives the maximum possible 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.950
 pump blood flow but also being say 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 so to the super series fans, I recommend 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.489
 I recommend you also try this 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.890
 combination 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.620
 the development of the shoulder girdle for men 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 very important or the very moment therefore 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.980
 guys develop your shoulders at least 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.930
 because it looks very impressive 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.209
 to a lot of people 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.810
 what is the feature of bodybuilding what is it 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.100
 the secret and what about it 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 Belyakov's words 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.260
 mr olympia doriana yatsa telling them 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.110
 so guys in our business is very simple 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.870
 the main thing is to stretch and cut 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.239
 the following exercise we mix 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.910
 rear delta in heavy power mode 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.820
 who will train the simulator 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.709
 like a butterfly with variable swings in 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.549
 EKR side just about people based on 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.440
 nobility of movements main load 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.690
 heavy force regime here falls on 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.389
 rear key wisp which is how are you 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.290
 managed to notice in the simulator butterfly 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.359
 lamp load a lot of repetition goes on 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.519
 middle delta in crossover 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.980
 on variable mode which again 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.470
 provides maximum blood filling 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.889
 muscle how to go on stage how to reach 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.010
 this level I will say briefly the main thing 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.510
 do this exercise 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.220
 eat right and go to bed 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.769
 sleep u series of our various exercises 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.940
 for the deltoid muscles comes the ending 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.370
 apotheosis and 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.140
 and we will finish lying down 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.130
 bench swing on the back of the delta in the dumbbell 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.710
 alternately mode people often know 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.220
 complain that they cannot 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.530
 due to get into the shoulder muscles 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.780
 there are no pain guys there 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.610
 what advice carefully look for 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.110
 technique do not try to take weight more 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.060
 its possible because otherwise 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.550
 case we will take no longer shoulders 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.330
 this exercise is hard to work through 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.370
 back shoulder nuances for 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.490
 performance is highly desirable 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.750
 took the bench with adjustable angle 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.900
 head down because it provides 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.580
 casing good support on the floor in 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.190
 horizontal plane perform 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.520
 This movement is very convenient too. 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.040
 make sure that at runtime 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.490
 exercise your torso was maximized 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:48.190
 fixed and working is possible only 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.240
 arm also worth considering ulnar 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.790
 which joint 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.680
 and in the lower phase of the movement and the upper 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.720
 possibilities should be bent under 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.820
 Try not to use the same angle. 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.940
 change arm angle 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.270
 in the course of its rise and as much as possible 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.850
 feel contraction of the posterior shoulder 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.530
 beam in this is the meaning of movement 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.380
 prone position 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.230
 we throw hands with fixation 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.740
 top point and turn to steve along 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.710
 movement after training for 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.720
 replenishment is very helpful to take something 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.150
 what many call being with 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.650
 I call them simply irreplaceable Well 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.040
 guys our amazing workout on 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.740
 shoulders come to an end today in your likes 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.930
 sentenced forces remember this 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.690
 principle good memory comment calm 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.510
 the sea does not get so try to 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.290
 hall they sew or last force and then 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.290
 you will have success 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:02.300
 do you think get over here 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.300
 you almost adjust
