we<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> vehicle<00:02:13.739> dynamic<00:02:14.370> control<00:02:14.820> for

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
we got the vehicle dynamic control for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.360 
we got the vehicle dynamic control for
those<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.620> who<00:02:16.739> are<00:02:16.800> unfamiliar<00:02:17.190> with

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
those of you who are unfamiliar with

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.870 
those of you who are unfamiliar with
that<00:02:17.430> one

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
that one

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.580 
that one
basically<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.630> that's<00:02:18.720> gonna<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.350> one

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
basically what that's gonna do and one

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.050 
basically what that's gonna do and one
big<00:02:19.800> way<00:02:19.950> you're<00:02:20.100> gonna<00:02:20.190> benefit<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
big way you're gonna benefit on that is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.820 
big way you're gonna benefit on that is
it's<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.720> been<00:02:21.870> known<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.170> reduce<00:02:22.290> actions

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
it's not been known to reduce actions

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.550 
it's not been known to reduce actions
and<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.580> well<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.910> basically<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.930> correct<00:02:25.320> your

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and as well as basically we correct your

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.430 
and as well as basically we correct your
your<00:02:26.430> steering<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.050> event<00:02:28.170> of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
your steering if in the event of

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.530 
your steering if in the event of
understanding<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.220> over<00:02:29.519> steering<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:30.390> what

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
understanding or over steering so what

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
understanding or over steering so what
that<00:02:30.690> means<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.110> you're<00:02:31.230> sliding<00:02:31.500> along<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that means if you're sliding along the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.640 
that means if you're sliding along the
road<00:02:32.160> we're<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> do<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.650> basically

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
road we're just going to do is basically

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.770 
road we're just going to do is basically
the<00:02:34.860> tires<00:02:35.100> send<00:02:35.519> information<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the tires send information up to the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
the tires send information up to the
computer<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> vehicle<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.370> vehicle

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
computer of the vehicle the vehicle

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
computer of the vehicle the vehicle
dynamic<00:02:39.120> control<00:02:39.420> then<00:02:39.600> sends<00:02:40.050> back

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
dynamic control then sends back

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.979 
dynamic control then sends back
information<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.130> each<00:02:41.280> tire<00:02:41.610> and

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
information down to each tire and

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.600 
information down to each tire and
basically<00:02:42.989> sends<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.380> necessary<00:02:43.860> power<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
basically sends the necessary power to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.190 
basically sends the necessary power to
each<00:02:44.760> tire<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.450> help<00:02:45.600> recorrect<00:02:45.989> your

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
each tire to help recorrect your

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.509 
each tire to help recorrect your
steering<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.040> back<00:02:47.130> on<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> right

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
steering and get you back on the right

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.270 
steering and get you back on the right
path<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:48.060> vehicle<00:02:48.360> comes<00:02:48.690> standard<00:02:48.959> with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
path the vehicle comes standard with

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.979 
path the vehicle comes standard with
am/fm<00:02:50.280> radio<00:02:50.550> as<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> CD<00:02:51.750> player<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
am/fm radio as well as the CD player and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.040 
am/fm radio as well as the CD player and
auxiliary<00:02:52.350> input<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.959> you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
auxiliary input so basically what you

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.810 
auxiliary input so basically what you
can<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.470> obviously<00:02:55.709> get<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.430> auxiliary

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
can do is obviously get your auxiliary

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.850 
can do is obviously get your auxiliary
cable<00:02:57.269> plug<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.110> plug<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.560> into<00:02:58.680> your

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
cable plug it in plug it into your

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.979 
cable plug it in plug it into your
wireless<00:02:59.220> device<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.790> right<00:03:00.600> there<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
wireless device and right there at the

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.900 
wireless device and right there at the
touch<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.200> your<00:03:01.350> fingers<00:03:01.680> you've<00:03:02.130> got<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:02.730> many

that's<00:03:21.240> gonna<00:03:21.360> be<00:03:21.510> optimal<00:03:22.020> for<00:03:22.050> fuel<00:03:22.440> economy

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that's gonna be optimal for fuel economy

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.830 
that's gonna be optimal for fuel economy
and<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.460> giving<00:03:23.730> maximize<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> performance

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
and it's giving maximize the performance

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it's giving maximize the performance
of<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.620> specific<00:03:26.130> vehicle<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.030> along<00:03:27.480> with
