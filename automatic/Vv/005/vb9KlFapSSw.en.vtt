00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
top of some salmon last week and it was

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.210 
normally like three or probably two or
three<00:04:00.849> dollars<00:04:01.150> regularly<00:04:02.139> true<00:04:02.530> lemon<00:04:02.949> is<00:04:03.099> a

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
three dollars regularly true lemon is a

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.580 
three dollars regularly true lemon is a
name<00:04:03.489> brand<00:04:03.879> and<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.569> if<00:04:04.689> you<00:04:04.840> see<00:04:05.079> these<00:04:05.290> I'm
