00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.380
 hello good are mechanical referents in 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.460
 hospitalet and in this video I would like 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.139
 introduce you to the new 730 protests 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.539
 this is a 2015 model that ends us 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.059
 to get there very little and in this 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:19.900
 bike mount we have box 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.779
 carbon scale in matt black colors 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 white more than lokomat e is a box of 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.830
 less than one kilo of weight 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.710
 wiring and internal wiring for the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.239
 change and external wiring for the prize 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.540
 what makes it so much easier 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.470
 work with the brake propose it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.470
 for the mechanic 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.290
 and a two-dish transmission and 10 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.570
 pine nuts the pine nuts are 11 36 and the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.280
 dishes are 26 38 measures 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.059
 comes a change in sad 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.340
 stands of 27 and a half with women and hands 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:05.220
 and without cross 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.220
 comes mounted with the 615 brakes from 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 week that are very similar to some sl x 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.580
 or about 3 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.210
 the operation is practically the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.020
 same 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:21.230
 this visit comes with a cost 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.300
 of 100 mm in front 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.840
 the cete of that the three positions of 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.050
 lock that is open property what 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.860
 It causes a little harder and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.370
 blockage and we can go back to any of 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.370
 the three positions 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 We carry the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.420
 9 front and 9 axle far back 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.560
 and the box also comes with address 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.900
 to peret that is an octagon above and a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 fifth 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.710
 comes mounted with 20 buttons 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.010
 speeds 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.940
 and everything that comes being power 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.300
 handlebar seatpost are of the brand 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.040
 without cross 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.080
 two things that have called us quite 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.180
 the attention is that in this year they have 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.710
 varied the saddles have changed 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.570
 they have made new models that have 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.700
 rather better looking than the year 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.489
 past 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.780
 in terms of comfort it is wider in the 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.190
 front part 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.190
 very comfortable well mounted with a handlebar 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 without cross of 72 millimeters and the other 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.810
 thing that I did not know about more the attention is 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.840
 the powers the powers this year have 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 chosen to mount specific powers of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 new measurements of wheels that the 27 and 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.150
 medium and 29 if you look at the power of 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.150
 up here it's flatter and here below 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.300
 excelled the bottom part so that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.920
 the handlebar is a little lower and 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.760
 we have no feeling that the bike 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.900
 It is very high age 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.390
 Well, these are the 2015 models 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.299

 presentation videos we have 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.410
 enough videos of mechanics and for 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.140
 anything else 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.230
