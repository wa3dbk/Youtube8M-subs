00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
using this index finger I'm barring over

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.359 
using this index finger I'm barring over
all<00:01:23.130> three<00:01:23.369> strings<00:01:23.959> like<00:01:24.959> that<00:01:25.200> by<00:01:26.100> keeping

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
all three strings like that by keeping

all three strings like that by keeping
this<00:01:26.759> third<00:01:27.179> finger<00:01:27.450> here

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.870 

and<00:01:30.320> now<00:01:30.439> focusing<00:01:30.950> I'm<00:01:31.070> trying<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.369> get<00:01:31.520> that

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and now focusing I'm trying to get that

see<00:01:43.759> like<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.270> ring<00:01:44.420> like<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:46.030> three

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
see like that the ring like that three

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.810 
see like that the ring like that three
notes<00:01:47.179> together<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:52.340> then<00:01:53.329> I<00:01:53.360> go<00:01:53.539> back<00:01:53.570> to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
notes together and then I go back to

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:13.140 
notes together and then I go back to
only<00:01:55.820> two<00:01:55.970> notes<00:01:56.770> this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.850 

and<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:14.930> I'm<00:02:14.989> switching<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.590> e<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.989> same<00:02:18.230> idea

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and now I'm switching to e the same idea

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.250 
and now I'm switching to e the same idea
under<00:02:19.130> smoothly<00:02:19.400> switching<00:02:20.000> strings<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:20.599> I'm

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
under smoothly switching strings now I'm

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.610 
under smoothly switching strings now I'm
gonna<00:02:21.380> start<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.030> string<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
gonna start on the a string and the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:37.400 
gonna start on the a string and the
others<00:02:25.069> fingers<00:02:25.819> move<00:02:26.500> accordingly

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.550 

back

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040 

then<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.650> move<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.190> F<00:02:47.340> sharp<00:02:47.630> same<00:02:48.630> as<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.020> e

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
then I move up to F sharp same as the e

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.950 
then I move up to F sharp same as the e
thing<00:02:49.440> my<00:02:49.560> guests<00:02:49.740> move<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:51.510> more<00:02:51.690> frets

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
thing my guests move up to more frets

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.630 
thing my guests move up to more frets
and<00:02:52.620> play

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.210 

back

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.820 

you<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.640> use<00:03:09.849> an<00:03:10.000> up-and-down<00:03:10.830> motion

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
you have to use an up-and-down motion

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.800 
you have to use an up-and-down motion
like<00:03:12.250> this

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.870 

oh<00:03:20.069> okay<00:03:21.069> I'll<00:03:21.160> try<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> little<00:03:21.670> bit

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
oh okay I'll try that a little bit

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.360 
oh okay I'll try that a little bit
slower<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.650> these<00:03:23.860> fingers<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.280> know

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
slower so this these fingers you know

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.420 
slower so this these fingers you know
what<00:03:24.520> what<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:24.760> do<00:03:24.819> in<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.380> front<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:26.800> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
what what they do in the front there and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.940 
what what they do in the front there and
the<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:30.580> hand<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.000> going

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:04:11.150 

as<00:03:38.950> up<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.310> down

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.930 

okay<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.410> trickiest<00:04:14.800> part<00:04:15.129> is<00:04:15.310> muting

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
okay and the trickiest part is muting

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.300 
okay and the trickiest part is muting
the<00:04:15.970> strings<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.480> you're<00:04:16.660> not<00:04:16.780> playing<00:04:17.350> well

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
the strings that you're not playing well

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.789 
the strings that you're not playing well
that<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.549> don't<00:04:18.730> want<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.120> ring<00:04:19.299> like<00:04:19.799> you

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
that you don't want to ring like you

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.840 
that you don't want to ring like you
don't<00:04:20.980> want<00:04:21.100> all<00:04:21.639> these<00:04:21.880> bottom<00:04:22.810> strings<00:04:23.850> to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
don't want all these bottom strings to

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.250 
don't want all these bottom strings to
ring<00:04:24.880> because<00:04:25.510> you're<00:04:25.630> borrowing<00:04:25.810> here<00:04:26.080> so

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
ring because you're borrowing here so

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.290 
ring because you're borrowing here so
you<00:04:26.320> kind<00:04:26.500> of<00:04:26.620> have<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.770> bar<00:04:27.760> like<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.090> and

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
you kind of have to bar like this and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.150 
you kind of have to bar like this and
then<00:04:28.389> Bend<00:04:28.660> up<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.320> index<00:04:29.830> finger<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> little

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
then Bend up this index finger a little

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.129 
then Bend up this index finger a little
bit<00:04:30.340> lifting<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> little<00:04:31.510> bit<00:04:31.630> up<00:04:31.810> from<00:04:32.050> the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
bit lifting a little bit up from the

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.170 
bit lifting a little bit up from the
fretboard<00:04:32.410> so<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.220> mute<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.790> strings<00:04:34.030> so

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
fretboard so you mute the strings so

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:43.230 
fretboard so you mute the strings so
they<00:04:34.889> sound<00:04:35.889> like<00:04:35.979> that

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.380
