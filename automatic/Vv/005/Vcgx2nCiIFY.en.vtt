so over the next hour we will
demonstrate<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.750> six<00:02:52.530> step<00:02:52.739> process<00:02:52.800> by<00:02:53.610> which

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
demonstrate a six step process by which

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
demonstrate a six step process by which
people's<00:02:54.239> attitudes<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:55.020> being<00:02:55.590> changed

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
people's attitudes are being changed

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.809 
people's attitudes are being changed
permanently<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.470> population<00:02:58.470> wide<00:02:59.069> basis

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
permanently on a population wide basis

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.800 
permanently on a population wide basis
what<00:03:02.819> are<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.750> controlling<00:03:04.620> factors<00:03:05.480> in<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
what are the controlling factors in this

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.259 
what are the controlling factors in this
nation<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.590> permeates<00:03:08.370> all<00:03:08.580> cultures<00:03:09.090> at

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
nation that permeates all cultures at

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.270 
nation that permeates all cultures at
once<00:03:09.480> every<00:03:09.840> day<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.590> course<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> answer

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
once every day and of course the answer

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.809 
once every day and of course the answer
is<00:03:11.310> mass<00:03:11.880> media<00:03:12.300> okay<00:03:12.660> television<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
is mass media okay television is the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.770

in<00:03:18.989> my<00:03:19.140> study<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.650> came<00:03:20.040> across<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.730> change

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
in my study I came across this change

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.050 
in my study I came across this change
plan<00:03:22.049> this<00:03:22.350> attitude<00:03:22.680> change<00:03:23.220> plan<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.940> is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
plan this attitude change plan that is

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.699 
plan this attitude change plan that is
called<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.390> six<00:03:24.660> step<00:03:24.810> attitudinal<00:03:25.440> change

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
called a six step attitudinal change

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.490 
called a six step attitudinal change
plan<00:03:25.980> which<00:03:26.370> was<00:03:26.580> developed<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.120> change

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
plan which was developed to change

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.640 
plan which was developed to change
attitudes<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:29.130> values<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:30.209> people<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:31.620> a

attitudes and values of people on a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.490 
attitudes and values of people on a
population<00:03:32.459> wide<00:03:32.670> basis<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.959> read<00:03:34.260> it

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
population wide basis and as I read it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.470 
population wide basis and as I read it
and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:35.160> read<00:03:35.370> how<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.760> was<00:03:35.880> being<00:03:36.030> implemented

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and I read how it was being implemented

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.070 
and I read how it was being implemented
I<00:03:36.870> began<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.920> realize<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.700> main<00:03:39.239> target

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
I began to realize that the main target

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.610 
I began to realize that the main target
of<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.890> change<00:03:41.360> was<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.989> traditional

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
of this change was the traditional

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.400 
of this change was the traditional
Christian<00:03:44.069> his<00:03:44.580> values<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.180> his<00:03:45.330> attitudes<00:03:45.840> so

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
Christian his values of his attitudes so

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.130 
Christian his values of his attitudes so
let's<00:03:47.340> let's<00:03:47.790> identify<00:03:48.299> this<00:03:48.359> process<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
let's let's identify this process and

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.690 
let's let's identify this process and
then<00:03:49.230> we'll<00:03:49.410> look<00:03:49.500> at<00:03:49.650> examples<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.400> how<00:03:50.519> it's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
then we'll look at examples of how it's

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.240 
then we'll look at examples of how it's
used<00:03:50.940> today<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.570> you<00:03:52.290> will<00:03:52.410> realize<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:53.160> is

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
used today and you will realize it is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.759 
used today and you will realize it is
being<00:03:53.910> simultaneously<00:03:54.390> utilized<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.500> many

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
being simultaneously utilized in many

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.789 
being simultaneously utilized in many
