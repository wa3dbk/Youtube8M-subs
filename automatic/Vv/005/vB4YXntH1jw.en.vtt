00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.250
 at yoyo the beats and emery today 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.470
 we find ourselves for a new video 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 unfortunately not on the video that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.180
 you were all waiting for the one from 0.90 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.650
 presentation of mobs small problems 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 of school that's why I want you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.269
 do another video a glitch a glitch 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 course as indicated by the title 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.440
 allows to have invisible chests 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.540
 to get to finally do that's what 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 you understand me we're going right now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.579
 start this glitch so the glitch 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.750
 should be relatively fast without 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 too many problems 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.860
 finally that's it then this glitch can be 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 achieve with any type of 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.149
 stone who has a style yes I 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 take with his English so for those 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.989
 who do not know what the spurs are 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.059
 it's the stairs if you prefer 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 so that's that fire kim stuff and so he's you 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.090
 will need at least two spurs to make 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.760
 your left which is to see a chest 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.280
 invisible sorry for the little bauer 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.310
 will answer later then you will need 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 simply already the blog in question 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 as well as the stage of the block and yes for 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.979
 that the chest is invisible for not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 that he can not see himself then 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.490
 for here I have a little bit of wood that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.439
 I have to look 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.119
 so I'm going to take hawks 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.520
 thesis firstly you put your 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.070
 first 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 and resca related either here or here a little 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.560
 imported 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.299
 I advise you here to talk about 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.490
 do like in the tutorial like that no 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.100
 problem you put it like these 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.640
 have had you put it aside then 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.619
 already we can see that a small block is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.259
 buggy then i'm going to show you with the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.530
 speed control one goes very very 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.020
 closer by then we can see that he 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.689
 there is a small line whereas here there is 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.489
 I do not think you have read 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.610
 close and rightly it is necessary to open the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.980
 not at this point but just at 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.140
 left because you see that loose his 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.599
 select the block and on the other because on 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.090
 this quarter the block is not selected 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.299
 which means we can click at 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.760
 through in cucq 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:32.980
 so I'm going to put my chests 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 here I am one is here is me 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.670
 removed this and where the split control 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.549
 really disgusting options in 0.9 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 it does not change too much so I 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.040
 find the little buggy and there you see 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.400
 I opened the weight I opened the 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.709
 safe when everywhere you are so you 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.690
 know about where you are 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.250
 see there there is one block is there the other 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.850
 meaning actually it's the blog and put of 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.910
 side like here and there so he is 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.889
 it is in this sense that we promise the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.269
 split 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:12.099
 but in this direction but still 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.880
 a blog on the side well it fills up 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.269
 for for example to make my sofa 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.799
 and although this block is invisible if you can 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.139
 to say that actually it is existing but 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.790
 nonexistent that's pretty complicated 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.769
 and so I'll show you that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.750
 also works with for example the 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.410
 stone of the stone command 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.180
 it's exactly the same thing so I 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.799
 find my coble com 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.129
 inventory is completely buggy to 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.939
 cause of the flying survivors yes I dry 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:46.359
 for accents of course crazy but 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:48.340
 tarnished by excuse me here then we're going 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.709
 take back the land we see nothing in 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.219
 what a shame I'm going to be but 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.049
 torch like crazy here thank you 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.930
 modes what is it beautiful I 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.909
 thank the person who told them 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.620
 especially firm had then I found myself 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.930
 my coben here I am going to do like those 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.340
 this ad is really fast 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.430
 Then I will put my coffers by 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.310
 there and there I take no I hurt them me 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.239
 amount x ray but no but what 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 what is it doing where are my stairs they are 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.130
 there and on my hand so here in 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.860
 the meaning I got completely drunk 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.880
 but we fight the balls 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:34.360
 oh no I'm really bad 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.190
 excuse good stalkers 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.750
 no I was wrong side of it 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.810
 any side walk there I put it 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.610
 side up game rests my chest 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:48.699
 no no no I said my chest 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.110
 thank you so so I propose my 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.669
 chest we will hand over the speed control 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.199
 to see a little bit 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:58.570
 where is the bug so so everywhere 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.870
 you see the little brother and that's fine 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.699
 on the left and there is no title 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.120
 since it's not me guay and the scene 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.530
 select his seleccion the block here 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 but no longer there which means that and that 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.240
 I click 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.800
 I have the chest obviously this is to 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.810
 carefully reproduce this test has been 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.840
 made by professionals 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.680
 nan this is really not happening there 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.659
 mess of stuff 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.009
 Anyway, I hope this video 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.500
 you will have rained secular and subscribe you 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.110
 share i hope you will love 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.849
 this glitch that I discovered is me 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.650
 who discovered them united on little mc 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.360
 it is I who am the first to I 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.659
 do it normally 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.009
 but I discovered them by myself 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.449
 I watched on no game chain the 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.520
 primipares so that's why 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.569
 it still deserves a little more 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.240
 milk than usual 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.319
 finally, I hope you'll have 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.120
 did this video and I tell you to 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.110

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.229
 2.0 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.169

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.000

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.800

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.129

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.129
