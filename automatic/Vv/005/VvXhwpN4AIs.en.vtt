you've gotten the first quarter cup in
you<00:03:39.549> can<00:03:39.700> add<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> little<00:03:40.150> faster<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
you can add a little faster and it's the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.880 
you can add a little faster and it's the
beginning<00:03:43.360> part<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.650> most

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
beginning part so it's really the most

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:53.610 
beginning part so it's really the most
crucial<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:52.239> then<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.450> little<00:03:52.810> bit<00:03:53.200> of<00:03:53.440> olive

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
crucial so then a little bit of olive

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.199 
crucial so then a little bit of olive
oil<00:03:53.890> there<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.310> I'm<00:03:54.370> gonna<00:03:54.519> then<00:03:54.850> add<00:03:55.180> a

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
oil there and I'm gonna then add a

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.350 
oil there and I'm gonna then add a
little<00:03:55.570> bit<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:55.840> my<00:03:56.459> lemon<00:03:57.459> juice<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:58.030> totally

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
little bit of my lemon juice and totally

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.310 
little bit of my lemon juice and totally
you'll<00:03:58.480> probably<00:03:58.690> add<00:03:58.900> about<00:03:59.079> two

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
you'll probably add about two

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.229 
you'll probably add about two
tablespoons<00:03:59.350> which<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.370> about<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.850> juice<00:04:01.030> of

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
tablespoons which is about the juice of

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:13.470 
tablespoons which is about the juice of
one<00:04:01.540> lemon<00:04:01.750> so

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.890 

so<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.569> looks<00:04:14.750> like<00:04:14.840> we're<00:04:15.080> getting<00:04:15.170> too<00:04:15.560> close

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
so it looks like we're getting too close

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.599 
so it looks like we're getting too close
that's<00:04:17.900> about<00:04:18.049> right<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:19.040> that's<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.280> looks

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that's about right so that's that looks

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.789 
that's about right so that's that looks
