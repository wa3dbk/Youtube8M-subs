00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 no 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.579
 hi today we prepare chicken breast 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.640
 this is a chicken breast 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.510
 of course I call it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.399
 I have here what the escalope 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.089
 so let's make with artichokes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.089
 light the fire in the pan where 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.519
 I put some extra virgin and one 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.769
 walnut just penalty for butter because being 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.979
 a meat so thin the chicken breast 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.100
 it needs slightly a little bit 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:59.489
 of fat in the sense that the oil goes more 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.259
 that the oil is fine, however, in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.530
 roughly it does not just accept 

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:08.490
 just the best butter is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.299
 to flavor it also because it is a flesh a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 little bit oar so slightly insipid 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 this and we do it with a thread of the lo 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 let's make a plate of artichokes with you 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 fast and very good to do too 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 here we are now let's see here I got it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.790
 I have cleaned the artichokes well 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 etc. then I put them in with 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.630
 lemon 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.440
 now I cut them into thin slices 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.360
 fine to make it all slightly 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.940
 meanwhile faster and even less less than 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:02.520
 I do not do so much less 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:08.750
 fried but rather liz boiling we are in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 water and salt naturally mastro 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.070
 here or salt water when 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.820
 they start boiling again, they are very fine 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.820
 because if you observe 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:30.730
 here they are, our chicken is going 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.730
 very well 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.580
 salt pepper naturally 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.099
 here we are 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:07.200
 we turn our gods chicken scales 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.480
 of artichokes are almost boiling me 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.580
 I recommend they must not cook must 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.980
 remain al dente so they are cut 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.670
 very fine when they got to 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.670
 boil the water are ready indeed 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.810
 here we are 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:50.840
 not just no more time as for 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:54.319
 salt the artichokes we were salted were 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:59.510
 in water and salt then we return there 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:04.459
 take the white wine we put a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.000
 bit to mix everything recalls a 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.000
 bit of parsley 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:20.380
 here we are 40 and now let's make the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:28.520
 flour of our breasts we have 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:31.130
 first past must think of me a little 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.430
 wise indeed he is already dedicating how 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.430
 you see 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.710
 here we are 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.389
 another moment and our dish is 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.130
 ready as you see nothing difficult 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.740
 indeed it is a dish that I would say faster than 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.349
 this does not exist with the same meat 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.650
 we can do both the turkey we can 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:57.800
 we can make pork escalopes 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.590
 we can do so many other things is almost 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:06.520
 all the meats, however, but the birds 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:09.700
 in my opinion they are the best here we are 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.700
 we put out the fire 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:33.610
 a single summit dish we have the 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:39.180
 outline we have all the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:41.980
 very rich, very flat 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.500
 then a dish with artichokes 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.220
 learns that particular taste due 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.980
 to the iron of the artichokes that we would say so 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.840
 really enhances the flesh enhances the 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.430
 white meat once found do 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.760
 also the rabbit with artichokes and 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.980
 very good with this it seems to me to have 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.690
 having said all I thank you for the time you 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.010
 you have dedicated me and as always to god 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.490
 enjoying goodbye to tomorrow 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.490
