00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
didn't personally find it that cold it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.850 
didn't personally find it that cold it
was<00:00:43.350> mild<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> where<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> cold

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
was mild and where it is on the cold

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
was mild and where it is on the cold
setting<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.789> brush<00:00:48.270> stroke<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.750> slower

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
setting it the brush stroke is slower

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.200 
setting it the brush stroke is slower
and<00:00:49.649> when<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> hot<00:00:50.730> setting<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and when it is on a hot setting it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.610 
and when it is on a hot setting it
rotates<00:00:52.079> faster<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.280> I'll<00:00:53.610> show<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.620> quick

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
rotates faster so I'll show you a quick

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:59.850 
rotates faster so I'll show you a quick
demo<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:57.180> it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860

the<00:02:11.180> advertisement<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.410> saw<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.980> showed

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
the advertisement that I saw it showed

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.729 
the advertisement that I saw it showed
that<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.700> had<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.180> start<00:02:14.450> with<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.530> root

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
that you had to start with the the root

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.320 
that you had to start with the the root
and<00:02:16.040> work<00:02:16.370> your<00:02:16.550> way<00:02:16.760> up

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
and work your way up

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.540 
and work your way up
well<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.170> method<00:02:18.770> didn't<00:02:19.010> work<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.250> me

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
well that method didn't work for me

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.360 
well that method didn't work for me
because<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.470> saw<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.680> whenever<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.190> was

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
because I I saw that whenever I was

going<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.880> it'll<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.239> higher<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.780> towards<00:02:24.410> my

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
going and it'll be higher in towards my

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.699 
going and it'll be higher in towards my
root<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.430> would<00:02:25.700> get<00:02:25.880> stuck<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.510> my<00:02:26.540> head<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.680> I

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
root it would get stuck in my head so I

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.890

had<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.069> rotate<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.850> reverse<00:02:29.270> side<00:02:29.569> to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
had to rotate it in the reverse side to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.210 
had to rotate it in the reverse side to
make<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> come<00:02:30.890> out<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:33.110> won't<00:02:33.410> get<00:02:33.590> tangled<00:02:34.100> in
