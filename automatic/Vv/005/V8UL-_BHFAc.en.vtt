the instructions to put on your hair
when<00:00:34.500> dry<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.090> reading<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
when dry but when I was reading like the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.780 
when dry but when I was reading like the
reviews<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.530> Amazon<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.399> there<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
reviews on Amazon I think there was this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
reviews on Amazon I think there was this
one<00:00:39.000> person<00:00:39.360> who<00:00:39.420> said<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.930> applied<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
one person who said that they applied it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
one person who said that they applied it
to<00:00:40.410> their<00:00:40.590> wet<00:00:40.829> hair<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> will

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to their wet hair but I think it will

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
to their wet hair but I think it will
work<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> problem<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.219> big<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.879> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
work but the problem is it's big it's so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.110 
work but the problem is it's big it's so
big<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.219> stuff<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> try<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
big right and stuff like when you try to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
big right and stuff like when you try to
rule<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.840> tight<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> would<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.610> done

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
rule it tight like how I would have done

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
rule it tight like how I would have done
with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> small<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:52.440> song<00:00:52.770> right<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
with the small one this song right here

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.330 
with the small one this song right here
starts<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> crinkle<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.739> then<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.920> happens

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
starts to crinkle and then what happens

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
starts to crinkle and then what happens
is<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.550> leaves<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> band<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> creases

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is it leaves like the band and creases

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.250 
is it leaves like the band and creases
from<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> crinkle<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> satin<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
from the crinkle of the satin on the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
from the crinkle of the satin on the
ends<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:01.829> hair<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> can't<00:01:03.660> really

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
ends of your hair so you can't really

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.320 
ends of your hair so you can't really
rule<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.589> tight<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.280> damp<00:01:05.790> hair<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.390> then

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
rule it that tight on damp hair and then

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
rule it that tight on damp hair and then
trying<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
trying to do it the way it is and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
trying to do it the way it is and
rolling<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.060> gonna<00:01:12.299> get<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.600> tight

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
rolling it it's not gonna get that tight

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
rolling it it's not gonna get that tight
so<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> felt<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.369> okay<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.760> may<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.180> like

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so I felt like okay this may not like

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
so I felt like okay this may not like
stretch<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:16.020> hair<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.890> tight<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
stretch my hair and make it as tight and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.380 
stretch my hair and make it as tight and
smooth<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.850> wanted<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
smooth as I wanted to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.410 
smooth as I wanted to
so<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.530> decided<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.700> wasn't<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.240> like

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so I decided like I wasn't going to like

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
so I decided like I wasn't going to like
bought<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:23.070> two<00:01:23.369> packs<00:01:23.670> of

bought up in it so I have two packs of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.499 
bought up in it so I have two packs of
these<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.330> wanna

like<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.610> somewhere<00:01:32.820> special<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.479> want

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
like I'm going somewhere special I want

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
like I'm going somewhere special I want
to<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:34.020> said<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.320> night<00:01:34.710> before<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> mean<00:01:35.340> we

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to me said that night before I mean we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
to me said that night before I mean we
can't<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.450> while<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.900> dry<00:01:37.200> but

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
can't like do that while it's dry but

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.350 
can't like do that while it's dry but
this<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:39.240> successful<00:01:40.110> okay<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.909> guess

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
this was not successful okay so I guess

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.569 
this was not successful okay so I guess
that's<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.229> mini<00:01:43.530> review<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
that's like a little mini review on the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.929 
that's like a little mini review on the
goody<00:01:45.030> sack<00:01:45.450> rule<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.549> alternative<00:01:47.549> instead

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
goody sack rule as a alternative instead

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.210 
goody sack rule as a alternative instead
of<00:01:48.090> using<00:01:48.240> magnetic<00:01:48.750> rulers<00:01:49.259> which<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.189> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of using magnetic rulers which can be a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910
