as<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:02.280> anthropomorphised<00:04:04.020> computer<00:04:05.020> rather

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
as a anthropomorphised computer rather

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.229 
as a anthropomorphised computer rather
than<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:06.730> know<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> human<00:04:07.239> analog<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:09.070> when<00:04:10.030> she

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
than you know a human analog so when she

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.259 
than you know a human analog so when she
kind<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.540> comes<00:04:10.750> up<00:04:10.989> with<00:04:11.260> these<00:04:12.269> human-like

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
kind of comes up with these human-like

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.349 
kind of comes up with these human-like
responses<00:04:14.050> it's<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.890> kind<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.519> gives<00:04:15.730> me<00:04:15.910> a

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
responses it's it kind of gives me a

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.530 
responses it's it kind of gives me a
