and hit my dog my wife so that wasn't it
wasn't<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.119> option<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.170> gotta<00:01:46.320> prepare

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
wasn't an option so you gotta prepare

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319

for threats you don't know about or

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
for threats you don't know about or
expect<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> hard<00:01:49.920> thing<00:01:50.100> to
