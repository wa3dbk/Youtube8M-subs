 law of forlan and boys today 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 nuclear made thing from 45 euros the second 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.779
 pistolina that unlocks on black ops 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 two are but master from the bon gdf sniper 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.680
 a morality was a team station 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 Multiple and having said that I believe that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 he would have said everything since 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.559
 the class did not know if I want to know 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 my video will ask in the comments and not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.219
 blame me if not his part 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 in fact it is no longer so important 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.379
 within the commentaries, name the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.120
 class and no guys i hope that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.140
 and if he sees passing by the disney channel 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.780
 becks however I will also remember you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.070
 at the end of the video, it's still kids 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.989
 this gp I wanted to talk about a topic 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.059
 very similar to the one I had 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 last spoken commentary 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.160
 Veronese tore up that it is not really 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 similar ie it is directly connected 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.810
 because it's okay to understand too much 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.150
 no guys these days i'm 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.650
 informed a lot because anyway I have 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.979
 also intrigued by my own 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.210
 says an incredible curiosity 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.630
 and so I started talking to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 I live with the riad that my consultant from 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.290
 who nun has it when it comes to this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.080
 what and nothing I have sent an hour e 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.210
 half and discovered more things 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 mamma mia va well tell you everything 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.320
 also in the comments of the future therefore 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 Today, guys, I wanted to talk about 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.860
 two other videos very similar if not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.470
 worse than that of daisy destruction 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.729
 here are the boys as usual as in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.229
 all fields there is an internal struggle 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.460
 decide which is the most terrible like 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.799
 the dream and the console war 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.240
 that of what there is what has the play 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.920
 which says better the play is what 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.260
 has the xbox say that ever and the xbox here 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.330
 here there are people who say it's worse 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.990
 give up people who say that 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.090
 They are worse 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.070
 the other two videos called by 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.840
 full of essex trimble boys from full house 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 of I will be able to establish you also one 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.360
 scenario because one has written a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.100
 article on the site of pasta crisis from which 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.780
 usually we take them first pasta e e 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.640
 luke however is on the site in Spanish therefore 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.530
 there was no translation in Italian ha 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.900
 had to translate it with google translator 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.500
 because I don't know Spanish and therefore 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.989
 anyway like how you all know 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.300
 they do enough kacar and the translations 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.400
 google translator so it is not 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.200
 translated perfectly because I am 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.480
 managed to get an idea and he will talk to you 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.560
 precisely of the scenario that will be created in 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.890
 that in quantity the second video grapes 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.590
 xxx single this side of this instead not 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.510
 I managed to find even one 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.750
 information is what he told me 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.370
 in fact riotto who told me that there 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.670
 are four children who have been 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.100
 tortured in the worst fashions in the worst 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.470
 ways a child even divide it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.410
 with a chainsaw it is another where 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.240
 captain 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.540
 they stop which on the formations because 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.040
 however as you know I am very 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.160
 these are difficult to find this 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.530
 kind of information and just not 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.970
 usually manages to reach one 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.500
 complete scenario 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.630
 here instead with from full of I have been 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.040
 very much luckier already lucky 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.810
 in quotation marks for doing a lot 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.710
 willingly without knowing these things 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.160
 they are really horrible however it is anyway 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.650
 really a terrible scenario is that 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.510
 I would have died of curiosity if not if 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
 had never come to know e 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.050
 no boys 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.640
 this video is very similar to six green 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.700
 balls because also four tortured 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.450
 killed in the most different ways 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.940
 kids is pretty much the scene why 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.410
 obviously it's a video starts with two 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.810
 men sitting a table that why 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.870
 they are drinking at the beer and are starting to 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.460
 talking with one goes to urinate to piss 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.520
 oh well I can say piss not me 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.840
 interested do not do ie is done 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.970
 see camera so you can 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.830
 imagine that sucks that is surely 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.350
 you'll never have surely seen it 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.850
 someone who does who pee though 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.370
 watching a video was certainly more 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.890
 impression and then take the car 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.670
 a blue car and a house of 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.669
 these two women 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.380
 the two women let them in and take it 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.970
 some bags from these bags like 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.580
 can you imagine there will be gods inside 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.470
 children right now starts a 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.410
 dialogue between the ultras and the men 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.280
 woman and women lead to the plan of 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.250
 over the children inside the bags here 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.260
 start killing children there 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.430
 I will only read anxiety number of lakes 19 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.370
 I read it because it is not right 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.200
 reading is interpreting it anyway 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.400
 I will only talk about the first child 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.320
 killed 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.750
 and then I think I will stop that paper 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.270
 anyway it doesn't seem to me that much 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.580
 respectful and does not even seem to me that much 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.710
 nice to talk about these things if I want to 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.740
 so he will only talk to you about the first one 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.650
 they go a little less brutal arrives 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.460
 over a woman who takes herself for the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.210
 neck this baby and the baby starts 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:17.090
 to cry crying then start a 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.380
 tighten more tightly on the neck and take 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.090
 outside the toolbox 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:28.310
 mason's tools takes a hammer 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:32.570
 and the son sila on the head on the nape 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.490
 and the child dies but does not die immediately 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.830
 and some are still heard 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.479
 green and then you see the child falling 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.199
 with a trickle of blood coming out 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.030
 from the eyes from the ears and this already 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.300
 taking advantage of the first scene is heartbreaking 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.570
 to read to read 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.699
 imagine yourself looking at it for how much 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.410
 it should be what it should be 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.720
 heartbreaking for this person who 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.039
 just the view and no kids too 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.289
 today we have reached the end of 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.960
 this commentary I believe I will do 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:05.389
 many other commentaries on this 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.340
 style in the future because I am anyway 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.070
