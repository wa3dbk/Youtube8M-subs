winning<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.810> game<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.349> we<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.860> was

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
winning that game and I think we it was

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
winning that game and I think we it was
actually<00:02:17.520> quite<00:02:17.640> even<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.120> lot<00:02:18.270> more<00:02:18.420> even<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
actually quite even a lot more even the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120 
actually quite even a lot more even the
score<00:02:19.080> would<00:02:19.230> suggest<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.680> mean<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:19.890> did<00:02:20.010> get

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
score would suggest I mean we did get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.430 
score would suggest I mean we did get
very<00:02:20.370> lucky<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.819> last<00:02:21.180> goal<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.959> mean

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
very lucky with that last goal so I mean

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.949 
very lucky with that last goal so I mean
it's<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.239> not<00:02:24.239> too<00:02:24.450> much<00:02:24.540> if<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.750> fact
