00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.420 
expect a Raikou for example so now both
atoms<00:04:21.419> can<00:04:21.840> detect<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.229> turn<00:04:22.469> so<00:04:23.070> that's<00:04:23.250> why

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
atoms can detect this turn so that's why

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.400 
atoms can detect this turn so that's why
i<00:04:23.460> overlay<00:04:23.940> them<00:04:24.120> with<00:04:24.330> guile<00:04:24.990> dragoon

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
i overlay them with guile dragoon

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.560 
i overlay them with guile dragoon
it's<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.710> yes<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.940> trampled<00:04:28.390> ripped

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
it's a yes it's a trampled ripped

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.740 
it's a yes it's a trampled ripped
through<00:04:29.050> six<00:04:29.320> attack<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:30.310> text<00:04:30.580> /<00:04:30.760> defense<00:04:31.090> so

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
through six attack the text / defense so

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.840 
through six attack the text / defense so
now<00:04:31.900> almost<00:04:32.290> like<00:04:32.470> an<00:04:32.590> attack<00:04:32.830> also<00:04:33.190> activated

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
now almost like an attack also activated

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.630 
now almost like an attack also activated
reborn<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.390> red<00:04:34.540> eyes<00:04:34.690> for<00:04:35.200> overkill<00:04:35.740> so

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
reborn on the red eyes for overkill so

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.920 
reborn on the red eyes for overkill so
yeah<00:04:37.090> it's<00:04:37.270> no<00:04:37.420> velar<00:04:37.860> no<00:04:38.860> goers<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:39.930> that

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
yeah it's no velar no goers so that

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.690 
yeah it's no velar no goers so that
means<00:04:41.140> good<00:04:41.410> game<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:43.690> shows<00:04:43.900> all<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.140> cards

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
means good game it shows all the cards
