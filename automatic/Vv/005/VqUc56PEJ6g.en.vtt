00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
is this is gonna work well on the same

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.929 
is this is gonna work well on the same
page<00:01:34.799> here<00:01:35.009> let's<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.310> move<00:01:35.610> forward<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
page here let's just move forward I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.849 
page here let's just move forward I
thought<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.240> got

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.289

so the motorized Patriot of the couple

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.580 
so the motorized Patriot of the couple
things<00:01:45.450> make<00:01:45.600> him<00:01:45.719> really<00:01:45.899> special<00:01:46.289> decides

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the aesthetic of him one is that he's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
the aesthetic of him one is that he's
I'm<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.840> mostly<00:01:49.259> enemies<00:01:49.590> he's<00:01:49.679> completely
