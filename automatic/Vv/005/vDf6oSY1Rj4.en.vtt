running<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> wing<00:00:54.930> cuts<00:00:55.379> inside<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
running down the wing cuts inside and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.060 
running down the wing cuts inside and
just<00:00:56.430> finesse<00:00:57.059> bottom<00:00:57.600> corner<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.710> really

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
just finesse bottom corner not really

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.849

that<00:00:59.100> much<00:00:59.460> pace<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> shot<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.590> had

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that much pace on the shot but it had

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.740 
that much pace on the shot but it had
enough<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.460> past<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> keeper<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.359> that's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
enough to get past the keeper so that's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960

pretty<00:01:03.989> cool<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:05.129> makes<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.729> nil<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pretty cool and that makes it one nil to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.310 
pretty cool and that makes it one nil to
me<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.740> looking<00:01:08.010> good<00:01:08.340> already

think<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.189> six<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> half<00:01:56.820> grand<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
think we get six and a half grand as a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.340 
think we get six and a half grand as a
promotion<00:02:00.030> bonus<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.200> very

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
promotion bonus so that will be very

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800 
promotion bonus so that will be very
nice<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.820> squad<00:02:03.119> maybe

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
nice I can use that on my squad maybe

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.620 
nice I can use that on my squad maybe
save<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.649> someone<00:02:05.070> who<00:02:05.909> knows<00:02:06.149> I'm<00:02:06.570> not

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
save up for someone who knows I'm not

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.619 
save up for someone who knows I'm not
really<00:02:06.960> sure<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:08.179> we<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.360> carry

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
really sure right now but we will carry

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.619 
really sure right now but we will carry
on<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.170> I'm<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.860> sort<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.940> swapping<00:02:12.300> some

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
on and I'm just sort of swapping some

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.370 
on and I'm just sort of swapping some
players<00:02:12.870> around

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
players around

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.690 
players around
here<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.370> people<00:02:14.610> are

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
here just because some people are

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.760 
here just because some people are
getting<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.060> tired<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.350> don't<00:02:16.620> want

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
getting a bit tired and I don't want

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
getting a bit tired and I don't want
that<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.160> happen<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.030> want<00:02:18.240> everyone

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that to happen because I want everyone

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.830 
that to happen because I want everyone
to<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.900> full<00:02:19.200> fitness<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.850> probably<00:02:21.600> could

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to have full fitness I probably could

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.650 
to have full fitness I probably could
have<00:02:21.870> waited<00:02:22.110> until<00:02:22.500> after<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.910> got<00:02:24.300> promoted

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
have waited until after I got promoted

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.050 
have waited until after I got promoted
but<00:02:25.170> I've<00:02:25.440> got<00:02:25.770> quite<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.010> few<00:02:26.250> games<00:02:26.430> left<00:02:26.850> I

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
but I've got quite a few games left I

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.180 
but I've got quite a few games left I
think<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.630> can't<00:02:28.020> really<00:02:28.320> remember<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:28.800> I

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
think I can't really remember but I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
think I can't really remember but I
thought<00:02:29.520> I'd<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.760> swap<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.180> fri<00:02:30.390> now<00:02:30.570> and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
thought I'd just swap out fri now and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.230 
thought I'd just swap out fri now and
risk<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.710> losing<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.220> bit<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.400> chemistry<00:02:32.670> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
risk like losing a bit of chemistry to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.460 
risk like losing a bit of chemistry to
get<00:02:33.510> my<00:02:33.840> fitness<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:35.430> players<00:02:35.730> back<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
get my fitness of my players back up and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.050 
get my fitness of my players back up and
this<00:02:37.470> game<00:02:37.770> we<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:37.980> playing<00:02:38.100> against<00:02:38.610> lost

this game we are playing against lost

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.960 
this game we are playing against lost
little<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.380> one<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.770> unprofessional<00:02:41.250> so

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
little and this one is unprofessional so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.710 
little and this one is unprofessional so
I<00:02:42.150> could<00:02:42.450> afford<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.790> lower<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:45.030> chemistry<00:02:45.480> for

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
I could afford to lower my chemistry for

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.380 
I could afford to lower my chemistry for
this<00:02:45.840> game<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.800> I've<00:02:47.640> still<00:02:48.030> got<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:48.360> more

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
game after this one as well if I fail to

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.640 
game after this one as well if I fail to
win<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.120> only<00:02:51.300> unprofessional<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.410> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
win but it's only unprofessional so I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.460 
win but it's only unprofessional so I
should<00:02:53.520> really<00:02:53.790> win<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.210> one<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.690> angin

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
should really win this one and angin

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.830 
should really win this one and angin
gets<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.980> ball<00:02:56.190> right<00:02:56.790> hand<00:02:57.150> side<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.630> box

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
gets the ball right hand side of the box

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.310 
gets the ball right hand side of the box
and<00:02:58.970> basically<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.150> PVR<00:03:00.660> glitched<00:03:01.050> out<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
and basically my PVR glitched out a

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.140 
and basically my PVR glitched out a
little<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.830> but<00:03:02.100> basically<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:02.730> kept<00:03:03.030> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
little there but basically I kept the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.330 
little there but basically I kept the
ball<00:03:03.300> for<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:04.260> minutes<00:03:04.470> or<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.130> sort

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
ball for like two minutes or so it sort

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.100 
ball for like two minutes or so it sort
of<00:03:05.370> bounced<00:03:05.760> around<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:06.150> bit<00:03:06.300> then<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> passed<00:03:06.900> it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
of bounced around a bit then I passed it

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.710 
of bounced around a bit then I passed it
to<00:03:07.680> hang<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.040> again<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.610> he<00:03:08.970> finished<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.540> with

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
to hang in again and he finished it with

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.230 
to hang in again and he finished it with
his<00:03:09.840> left<00:03:10.050> foot<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:11.040> reason<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.400> edited<00:03:11.880> it

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240

a bottom corner keeper couldn't do much

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.210 
a bottom corner keeper couldn't do much
about<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.870> he<00:03:34.500> saw<00:03:34.710> just<00:03:34.950> fell<00:03:35.190> over

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
about that he saw just fell over

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.220 
about that he saw just fell over
backwards<00:03:35.550> trying<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.390> save<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.870> not<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
best attempt that could have done but I

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.780 
best attempt that could have done but I
will<00:03:40.320> take<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.590> because<00:03:41.100> that's<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.430> goal<00:03:41.610> for

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
will take that because that's a goal for

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
15 grand and there's quite a few so then

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.279 
15 grand and there's quite a few so then
I<00:05:34.830> realized<00:05:35.370> i've<00:05:35.699> got<00:05:35.970> to<00:05:36.060> get<00:05:36.150> him<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.479> a<00:05:36.570> 442

that<00:05:45.960> have<00:05:46.260> low<00:05:46.560> bids<00:05:46.830> so<00:05:47.099> i<00:05:47.130> thought<00:05:47.340> i'd<00:05:47.490> just

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
that have low bids so i thought i'd just

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.879 
that have low bids so i thought i'd just
whack<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.479> bid<00:05:48.810> on<00:05:48.840> one<00:05:49.139> of<00:05:49.289> them<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.530> then<00:05:49.860> i

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
whack a bid on one of them and then i

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.580 
whack a bid on one of them and then i
can<00:05:50.250> come<00:05:50.490> back<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:50.970> bid<00:05:51.840> on<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.139> more<00:05:52.440> if

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
can come back and bid on the more if

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.820 
can come back and bid on the more if
need<00:05:53.400> be<00:05:53.430> but<00:05:54.210> then<00:05:54.479> i<00:05:54.750> went<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.440> my<00:05:55.590> watch<00:05:55.800> list

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830

need be but then i went to my watch list
and<00:05:56.430> realized<00:05:56.880> yet<00:05:57.630> again<00:05:57.990> i<00:05:58.020> think<00:05:58.199> this

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
and realized yet again i think this

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.219 
and realized yet again i think this
