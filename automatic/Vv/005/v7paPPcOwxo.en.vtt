 megan to death a gamer world of your 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 way 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.560
 the editor of the magazine retro magazine more 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 is as bold as a project 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700
 face while many companies over 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.920
 are launching video games 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.430
 new generation every time thought 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 stronger with 3d games and everything else 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.400
 This guy wants to launch the video game. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.250
 retro with even face cartridge ribbons 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.529
 with graphics all over there from video games 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 old even then face the justification 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 his is the one he wants the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 people have that pleasure of yesteryear. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.360
 collect the tapes and take possession of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 game to us before and is today 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.739
 decreasing more and more with the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.079
 them and the part of up to 25 years for 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.180
 councilors the things that do not have the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.770
 physical media in one player's hand 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 It's not very important for that I am 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 a player who likes this for more than 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 I have several young people, I think. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.680
 very nice you tell me you 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.750
 will have the tape with the success 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.039
 I thought it was cool and he gave a lot 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.600
 importance for this and also how 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.309
 other things that had many games 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 The old ones that we have today are true 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.659
 that we have today had no games 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 old as bugs the correction of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.500
 banks that have multiple updates and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.930
 several things have to leave the business 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 fixing and the guys throw a game 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.070
 with a problem for later human error 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.150
 While you already paid the game then he 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.740
 has this daring design this project 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.759
 cool, I think it's cool, part of them 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.320
 part of the project 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.720
 so it's going to be an interesting thing 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 he is launching a project that is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 be briefly very soon for 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 everyone who wants and has an interest 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 about this you that console that is 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 seeing behind us there are some 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.770
 aquino colors in some photos with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 different colors but it's pretty cool guy 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.990
 have the parents two controls equal 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.490
 old video games and usb port that I 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.530
 I think it must be because you put the game 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930
 it will not be the game the game will be by 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 false bay tape will make any sense 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.219
 for this we will find out if we can 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.649
 being the world can not be controlled if 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.570
 well but it may be that it is also the control 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.210
 It sure is going to be here but he can. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.890
 have a parallel control option but the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.810
 People are very curious, man. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 I'm curious because I really like 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.649
 playing ancient is the kind of chart that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.769
 pleases gameplay type that pleases 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.560
 he saw this in various games indicate 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.409
 play is released sometimes it comes in 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.299
 but there were times you have on the PSN or something 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.579
 kind of small games that galley 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.110
 end up really enjoying playing and that are 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.849
 with all video game graphics 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.459
 then he wants to bring this as 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.000
 nor from his platform so he wants 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.549
 have this kind of game as the main 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.549
 mega death the gamer world your way
