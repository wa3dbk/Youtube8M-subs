00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
so now we're just going to finish by

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.390 
so now we're just going to finish by
hiding<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:15.170> wires<00:00:15.940> here<00:00:17.289> down<00:00:18.289> through<00:00:19.130> like

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
hiding the wires here down through like

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.660 
hiding the wires here down through like
three<00:00:19.789> or<00:00:20.150> four<00:00:20.920> feeds<00:00:22.029> again<00:00:24.189> you<00:00:25.189> have<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:25.550> be

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
three or four feeds again you have to be

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.029 
three or four feeds again you have to be
patient<00:00:26.000> because<00:00:26.990> there's<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.160> many<00:00:28.310> wires

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
patient because there's so many wires

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.710 
patient because there's so many wires
going<00:00:31.039> through<00:00:31.310> here<00:00:31.670> all<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.849> readies<00:00:32.300> in<00:00:32.599> it

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
going through here all the readies in it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:46.660 
going through here all the readies in it
no<00:00:33.110> it's<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:40.450> okay<00:00:43.000> so<00:00:44.000> now<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.860> last<00:00:46.129> wires

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
no it's just okay so now the last wires

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.569 
no it's just okay so now the last wires
crisscrossed<00:00:47.570> here<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:48.949> all<00:00:49.250> we<00:00:49.430> need

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
crisscrossed here and then all we need

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.840 
crisscrossed here and then all we need
to<00:00:49.610> do<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.239> just<00:00:50.750> snip<00:00:51.079> that<00:00:51.800> off<00:00:51.859> make<00:00:52.550> sure

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
to do is just snip that off make sure

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.110 
to do is just snip that off make sure
you<00:00:53.030> don't<00:00:53.180> cut<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.590> main<00:00:54.590> wire<00:00:54.920> just<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.910> one

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
you don't cut the main wire just the one

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.349 
you don't cut the main wire just the one
that's<00:00:56.359> sticking<00:00:56.660> out<00:00:57.640> so<00:00:59.769> there<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:01.010> is<00:01:01.359> this

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
that's sticking out so there it is this

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
the same thing with this light so now

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.609 
the same thing with this light so now
we're<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.680> end<00:01:13.000> almost<00:01:14.000> finish<00:01:14.509> I<00:01:14.810> just

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.010 

four<00:01:52.520> beats<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:55.090> depending<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.240> how<00:01:56.450> big<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
four beats so depending on how big is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.700 
four beats so depending on how big is
your<00:01:57.050> gap<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:58.130> can<00:01:59.080> put<00:02:00.080> three<00:02:00.680> four<00:02:01.520> or<00:02:02.240> five

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
your gap you can put three four or five

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:15.850 
your gap you can put three four or five
and<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:04.190> do<00:02:05.120> this<00:02:12.070> right<00:02:13.070> there<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:15.590> just

and just do this right there you just

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:25.020 
and just do this right there you just
need<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.390> back<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.320> we're<00:02:24.800> just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
need to go back so now we're just

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.810 
need to go back so now we're just
finishing<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.990> up<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:30.250> already<00:02:31.250> went<00:02:31.580> back

finishing this up I already went back

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.610 
finishing this up I already went back
through<00:02:32.600> all<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.930> speeds<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.380> where

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
through all the speeds and this is where

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.130 
through all the speeds and this is where
it<00:02:36.710> ends<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.320> need<00:02:39.560> to<00:02:39.800> cut<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.340> off

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
so this is the one in pink and I did one

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.550 
so this is the one in pink and I did one
yesterday<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.780> one<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.239> we're<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
end almost finish I just need to do one

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.830 
end almost finish I just need to do one
more<00:03:12.550> do<00:03:13.550> here<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.630> two<00:03:14.989> on<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.380> other<00:03:15.680> side

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
more do here and two on the other side

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:27.110 
more do here and two on the other side
and<00:03:17.840> then<00:03:19.600> crisscross

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.000 

and<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:28.890> what<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.920> did<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.780> V<00:03:35.170> gap

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
and then what I did this is the V gap

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:47.100 
and then what I did this is the V gap
here<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:38.940> put<00:03:42.390> four<00:03:43.390> beats<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:45.990> depending<00:03:46.990> on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
here I put four beats so depending on

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.540 
here I put four beats so depending on
how<00:03:47.350> big<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.890> your<00:03:47.920> gap<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:49.000> can<00:03:49.950> put<00:03:50.950> three

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
how big is your gap you can put three

00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
how big is your gap you can put three
four<00:03:52.420> or<00:03:53.140> five<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:55.090> do<00:03:55.990> this<00:04:00.360> okay<00:04:01.360> so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
four or five and just do this okay so

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.990 
four or five and just do this okay so
that<00:04:02.530> should<00:04:02.560> take<00:04:02.980> care<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.400> guy<00:04:03.550> right

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
that should take care of that guy right

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.250 
that should take care of that guy right
there<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:05.100> then<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:06.760> need<00:04:07.360> again<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:10.260> go

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
there and then you just need again to go

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.560 
there and then you just need again to go
back<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.920> now<00:04:15.160> we're<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.870> finishing<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:17.859> up

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
back so now we're just finishing this up

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.760 
back so now we're just finishing this up
I<00:04:20.820> already<00:04:21.820> went<00:04:22.419> back<00:04:22.870> through<00:04:23.440> all<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
I already went back through all the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.670 
I already went back through all the
speeds<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:25.980> this<00:04:26.980> is<00:04:27.220> where<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.550> ends<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.680> I

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
speeds and this is where it ends and I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
speeds and this is where it ends and I
just<00:04:30.160> need<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.640> cut<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.180> off<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.370> one

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
just need to cut this off and this one

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.630 
just need to cut this off and this one
make<00:04:34.390> sure<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.600> then<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:39.250> have<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:40.060> finish

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
make sure and then you have your finish

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.800 
make sure and then you have your finish
so<00:04:42.870> this<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:45.370> one<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:46.000> pink<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:48.040> did<00:04:48.310> one

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810
