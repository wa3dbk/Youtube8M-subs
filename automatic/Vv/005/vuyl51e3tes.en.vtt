probably one of the best in the
industries<00:00:48.559> when<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.680> put<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.129> goggle<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
industries when you put this goggle on I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
industries when you put this goggle on I
mean<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:52.199> quite<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> bit

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
mean you can actually see quite a bit

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
mean you can actually see quite a bit
farther<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.910> each<00:00:54.300> angle<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
farther to each angle because of the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639 
farther to each angle because of the
curvature<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.579> lens<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> also

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
curvature of the lens and then you also

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.990 
curvature of the lens and then you also
do<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.160> get<00:00:59.430> any<00:01:01.010> air<00:01:02.010> gap<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:02.760> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
do not get any air gap through here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
do not get any air gap through here
which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.359> how<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.899> fogging

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
which is how you would get fogging

which is how you would get fogging
there's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.090> zero<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> test

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
there's just zero you can you can test

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.870 
there's just zero you can you can test
it<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.740> by<00:01:08.010> putting<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.340> finger<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.760> a
