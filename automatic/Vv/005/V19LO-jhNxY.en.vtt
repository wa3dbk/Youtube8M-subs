00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 in my opinion it 's easy 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.100
 Y 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 two 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 the second generation of the c4 picasso 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.430
 came to the market last summer and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 offers a modern image with a lot 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.160
 glazed surface and a very frontal 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.160
 technological 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 compact MPVs are coming 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.020
 increasingly at the level of 45 meters 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.650
 and the new c4 picasso has a length 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 of 443 meters with a width of 183 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.020
 meters and a height of 161 meters 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.350
 offers an interior with five spacious 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.290
 seats and a large capacity luggage compartment 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.870
 with 537 liters that can be expanded 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.550
 up to one thousand 709 liters 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.379
 rear seats 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.210
 in the second row has three 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.550
 individual seats that can be 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.700
 move longitudinally and offer 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.770
 various configuration possibilities 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.450
 in the most advanced position allow 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.090
 less legroom but 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.400
 boot volume increases until the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.900
 630 liters under the floor is a 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.900
 emergency spare wheel 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.970
 the aerodynamics has been optimized and the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.920
 cx penetration coefficient reaches a 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 remarkable value if we consider the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.990
 height with a figure of 0 30 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.810
 The hdi engine of the tested unit is a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.150
 four cylinders in line with 1.6 liters 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.880
 of single displacement camshaft in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 cylinder head two valves per cylinder 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.900
 Variable geometry turbocharger e 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 intercooler provides 115 hp 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.910
 maximum power and a good pushing torque 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.380
 which reaches its maximum value at 1750 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.360
 revolutions per minute 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 the gearbox is manual six 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.070
 marches and the driving force is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.560
 transmits to the front wheels 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.120
 The stop and start function of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.460
 automatic stop and start in 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 detentions 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 the car weighs almost 1,400 kilograms of 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.630
 So the accelerations are just 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.610
 correct with 11 to 8 seconds to pass 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.100
 from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour and one 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.680
 maximum speed of 189 kilometers per 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.840
 hour the average consumption approved by 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.610
 citroÃ«n is 4 liters fair every 100 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.730
 kilometers and it is not test we have measured 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.500
 5.7 liters per 100 kilometers is 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.930
 of a contained figure for a car of 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.820
 this size and weight in real conditions 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.180
 of circulation but higher than 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.180
 homologated 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.030
 and much more 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.340
 the address has the assistance 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.800
 electrical system sensitive to speed and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.570
 Brakes fulfill their mission well 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.160
 the front suspension is of the type 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.960
 mcpherson the most usual in the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.150
 vehicles of compact and medium size by 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.220
 its compactness and effectiveness and the back 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.810
 there is a simple set of wheel thrown 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.520
 with a torsion element at 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.410
 the morons offer a hardness 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.000
 intermediate and favor the comfort of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.800
 march although the swing of the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.520
 body in tight curves is 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.520
 evident 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.850
 the considerable width and distance 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.800
 between axes allow you a remarkable 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.630
 poise on the road and offers a good 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.550
 behavior with noble reactions and 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.870
 predictable that provide a 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.670
 very nice driving 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.260
 the rolling of the body is not a 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 problem when driving to rhythms 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.670
 moderate but if you drive to good 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.500
 rhythm in areas of linked curves can 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.209
 become upset and force reduction 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.209
 the speed to avoid scares 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.760
 the agility is remarkable given its size 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.560
 compact and for maneuvers in city 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.660
 has a rear view camera and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.000
 acoustic warnings away both 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.710
 front as back 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.780
 the elevated driving position 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.910
 favors visibility and seating 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.650
 they had the option of upholstery 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.720
 leather that costs two thousand euros and 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.360
 adds electric adjustment and heating 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.160
 hold the body well 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.480
 rear have air vents 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.480
 orientable on the sides 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.840
 adjustments and materials offer a 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.730
 remarkable perceived quality and the 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.920
 equipment is quite broad since 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.430
 it's about the exclusive that is the level 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.430
 higher 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.570
 the panoramic sunroof is an option 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.760
 It costs 720 euros and enjoy a 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.590
 large size but the sunshade parasol 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.630
 It is very translucent and lets pass 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 too much light and heat in the passenger compartment 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.990
 The practical tailgate is worth mentioning 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.340
 with electric opening and closing as well as 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.340
 access and keyless start
