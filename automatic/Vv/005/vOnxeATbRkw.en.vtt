ethernet<00:01:28.289> i'm<00:01:28.409> pretty<00:01:28.649> sure<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.950> gigabit

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
ethernet i'm pretty sure this is gigabit

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
ethernet i'm pretty sure this is gigabit
ethernet<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> new<00:01:30.749> ones<00:01:30.929> are<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.140> 10

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
ethernet but the new ones are only 10

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.969 
ethernet but the new ones are only 10
100<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> slower<00:01:32.819> ethernet<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
100 so it's going to slower ethernet and

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.840 
100 so it's going to slower ethernet and
happily<00:01:34.979> may<00:01:35.039> be<00:01:35.100> worth<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.639> go<00:01:35.759> ahead

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
happily may be worth it just to go ahead

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819
