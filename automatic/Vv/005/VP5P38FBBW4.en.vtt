00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
maybe I'll do to today last week what we
looked<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.080> working<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> hips<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
looked at was working the hips and the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
looked at was working the hips and the
knees<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> isolation<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
knees to get the isolation of the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.050 
knees to get the isolation of the
movement<00:00:28.410> through<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> hip<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> doesn't

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
movement through the hip so it doesn't

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
movement through the hip so it doesn't
trickle<00:00:30.269> up<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.199> stays<00:00:31.500> through<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> hip

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
trickle up it all stays through the hip

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.569 
trickle up it all stays through the hip

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
are working to isolate the movement

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
are working to isolate the movement
through<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> hips<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
through the hips and that's going to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.639 
through the hips and that's going to
give<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.059> foundation<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.230> most<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
give you your foundation for most of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
give you your foundation for most of
your<00:00:55.770> belly<00:00:55.920> dance<00:00:56.219> movements<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> hips

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
your belly dance movements with the hips

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
your belly dance movements with the hips
so<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> shift<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.920> weight<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.699> onto<00:01:00.059> one

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
so when I shift my weight over onto one

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
so when I shift my weight over onto one
leg<00:01:00.739> I'm<00:01:01.739> lifting<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.309> other<00:01:02.460> heel<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
leg I'm lifting the other heel up in the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.820 
leg I'm lifting the other heel up in the
air<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> keeping<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> up<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> whole<00:01:04.559> time

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
air and keeping it up the whole time

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
air and keeping it up the whole time
that<00:01:05.760> makes<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.180> easier<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.900> whenever<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
that makes it easier for whenever I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.530 
that makes it easier for whenever I
change<00:01:07.680> positions<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> hip

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
change positions and want to do a hip
lift<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:13.590> lifting<00:01:14.030> letting<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> hip

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
lift so as I'm lifting letting the hip

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.380 
lift so as I'm lifting letting the hip
come<00:01:15.450> up<00:01:15.740> my<00:01:16.740> other<00:01:16.979> knee<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.520> working<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.240> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
come up my other knee is working and you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
come up my other knee is working and you
can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> background<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
can see that in the background that the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
can see that in the background that the
other<00:01:20.340> knee<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> working<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> help<00:01:21.420> isolate

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
other knee is working to help isolate

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
other knee is working to help isolate
the<00:01:22.200> movement<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> hip<00:01:23.759> area<00:01:28.850> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the movement in just the hip area so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.190 
the movement in just the hip area so
here<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:32.450> without<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> movement<00:01:34.020> going

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
here we are without the movement going

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
here we are without the movement going
through<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> whole<00:01:34.710> body<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.850> point<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.299> if

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
through the whole body the point is if

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.399 
through the whole body the point is if
you<00:01:36.930> keep<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> back<00:01:37.650> knee<00:01:37.920> bent<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.229> do

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you keep that back knee bent but you do

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.140 
you keep that back knee bent but you do
your<00:01:40.590> lifts<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.880> let<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
your lifts and you don't let it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
your lifts and you don't let it
compensate<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> movement<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> whole

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
compensate for the movement the whole

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.270 
compensate for the movement the whole
body<00:01:44.430> moves<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> bit<00:01:45.570> choice<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.280> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
body moves so it's a bit choice and I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670 
body moves so it's a bit choice and I
just<00:01:47.460> realized<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.329> other<00:01:48.840> screen<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
running get me one second while I fix

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.209

again shift weight to the other leg and
actually<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.489> I've<00:02:08.910> shifted<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
actually this like I've shifted to and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.860 
actually this like I've shifted to and
again<00:02:10.379> lifting<00:02:11.220> my<00:02:11.670> heel<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.599> in<00:02:12.750> the

I<00:02:13.470> know<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.250> can't<00:02:14.460> really<00:02:14.700> show<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
I know if I can't really show you that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.460

you'll<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.480> trust<00:02:15.600> me<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.930> but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
you'll have to trust me on that but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
you'll have to trust me on that but
again<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.400> didn't<00:02:17.880> then<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.840> supporting<00:02:19.440> me

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
again if I didn't then the supporting me

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.770 
again if I didn't then the supporting me
this<00:02:19.830> would<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.070> they<00:02:20.220> don't<00:02:20.460> do<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.790> then

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
this would be they don't do this then

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.020 
this would be they don't do this then
both<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.740> work<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.400> knees<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> again<00:02:26.030> working

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
both but work the knees so again working

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.890 
both but work the knees so again working
the<00:02:27.540> knees<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:29.310> get<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.640> lift<00:02:30.000> happening

all the way through the back all the way
through<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.960> ribcage<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.340> bring<00:03:08.490> your

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
hands up and then what you want to do is

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.170 
hands up and then what you want to do is
minimize<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:14.100> movement<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.520> everything<00:03:15.000> else

minimize the movement of everything else

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.980 
minimize the movement of everything else
but<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.380> keep<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.010> ribcage<00:03:17.220> moving<00:03:20.990> so

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
but just keep the ribcage moving so

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.250 
but just keep the ribcage moving so
you've<00:03:22.650> got<00:03:22.680> ribs<00:03:23.640> moving<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.810> arms<00:03:25.140> are

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
you've got ribs moving the arms are

ribcage is going side to side now you're

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.280 
ribcage is going side to side now you're
not<00:03:32.790> actually<00:03:33.060> very<00:03:33.540> often<00:03:33.930> going<00:03:34.110> to
