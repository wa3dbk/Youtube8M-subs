 that has all the colors of jay mohr 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.540
 and they are seven colors of the gymboree because 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.520
 They are seven colors, well, because they are 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.340
 seven levels that they handle from 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 learning then each level 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.810
 represents a color and that's why the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 clown is also made up of 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.060
 those same colors plus what is the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.220
 jean maurice mascot and we put it 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.520
 all edible on top 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.950
 we put the logo and of course the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.240
 seven levels that represent the first 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.600
 level and good apart from the cake too 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.060

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.470
 clown print this is already part 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.500
 from our our printing range 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.509
 edible these decorated apples that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.459
 they are also beautiful because they have 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.390
 the seven colors feel the seven 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.670
 levels 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.840
 these star brownies that are 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.790
 super parents and we made some cake pops 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.280
 one for each level here I do not have them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.370
 all because they are seven colors but 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.489
 each level did level 1 to level 2 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.549
 3 so until 7 in the colors were going 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.500
 nuanced so that for dads and 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.530
 children can see everything they can 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.690
