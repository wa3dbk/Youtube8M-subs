00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
alternator as you can see right there

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
alternator as you can see right there
it's<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.829> tucked<00:00:50.039> away<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.910> there

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
so it's pretty easy as one bolt I see if

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
so it's pretty easy as one bolt I see if
I<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.379> see<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.640> zoom<00:00:56.789> into

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
I can get it I see if I can zoom into

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.440 
I can get it I see if I can zoom into
where<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.699> where<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:03.110> man

through<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.250> car<00:02:06.550> this<00:02:07.360> code<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:07.929> it's

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
through this car this code so it's

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.060 
through this car this code so it's
something<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.860> change<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.280> part<00:02:09.610> and

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
something to change this part and

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.960 
something to change this part and
hopefully<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.190> goes<00:02:12.370> away<00:02:12.489> there's<00:02:12.730> another

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
hopefully that goes away there's another

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.390 
hopefully that goes away there's another
thing<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.900> another<00:02:14.680> part<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.280> it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
thing in here that another part that it

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.949 
thing in here that another part that it
said<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.760> might<00:02:16.060> be<00:02:16.390> bad<00:02:17.290> it's<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.709> oil<00:02:18.959> ocv

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
