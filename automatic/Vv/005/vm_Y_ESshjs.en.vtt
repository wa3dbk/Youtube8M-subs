00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.980
 in a quick tea and marinka for this 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.690
 we need eggs 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 he randomly 4 eggs and beat them up 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.519
 either whisk or fork are not afraid of them 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.840
 with volume to mixer without adding 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.390
 sugar and something just drive eggs 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.489

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 so we did it now we take 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:45.360
 put on a griddle on mushrooms and we can 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.969
 add a little oil but if we 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.750

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.699

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:09.680
