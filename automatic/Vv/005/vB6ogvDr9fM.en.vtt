00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.029
 despite this 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:11.939
 but let's prepare the savings plans 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.549
 the plan is a very easy place to make and with few ingredients it combines 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.480
 next 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.480
 since you will only use all 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.519
 its ingredients to be able to realize these figures are 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.079
 one liter of milk 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.849
 a milk can with 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.819
 sugar 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.989
 a cinnamon stick in the hard and orange he loves soccer 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.890
 the first thing we are going to do is prepare the milk 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.030

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 a piece of opening of lemon and another bit the actress of the decade 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.880
 We heat the milk so that it acquires the flavor of the rest of 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.650
 ingredients 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.650
 then let's beat 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 then we will prepare caramel 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910
 for it the opportune goals we will add a quantity of sugar and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.260
 We'll warm up until we see how the cinnamon goes 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.660
 in this process we have to be very careful because it is very easy for us to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.689
 burn or we do not go too much and we have a somewhat bitter taste 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.070

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 three tablespoons of sugar and a little condensed milk 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.840
 we add the milk we beat well until all the components are mixed 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.939
 with the hot oven and with a little water nejapa juana maría we placed the 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.959
 plans inside it we wait for it to be taken control of the 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.419
 to know if the plan is made it is painted with a metal leaf if it comes out 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.379
 clean the plan and welcome it and leave cream stain you have to leave it longer 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.379
 nothing 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.419
