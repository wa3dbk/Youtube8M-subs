 It's okay guys before anything before 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.009
 start I wanted to tell you that this is a 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.230
 video that I recorded a long time ago 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.390
 because it was night they were 3 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.740
 morning more or less and I had thought 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.690
 upload it to the secondary channel that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.430
 you have in the description always but not 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 I wanted to upload it I know it's not 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.839
 a very fluid comment but I hope that 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.390
 you value trying to upload video because 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.429
 this week I'm going back on vacation 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 then I will not be able to upload many 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.779
 videos and this is one of them so 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 I hope you like it and not much more 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.060
 you are first character and in video 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.270
 -I'm spain and I'm going to eat all the 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.170
 cells that exist on this planet the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 objective that to give the first is that if 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 we eat to an origin 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
 here by here you know that you are like 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.649
 yourselves game and we are cells 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 to eat and eat mini cells 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 and then with the mouse to all the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
 cells the other cells is worth and this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.409
 that is simply about this 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.119
 so there are a lot of people here in henry 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.519
 must be from the first times to the fourth 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.320
 and then it's about staying in the top 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.299
 because in the top it's really cool to stay 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.049
 I arrived've reached maximum othón 9 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 I think but but that is not so difficult 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.750
 you have to have a bit of luck, yes 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.610
 Let's see 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 when we run more we run more 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 we run more we run more 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.079
 we run more run more perfect now 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.079
 here we do so hello 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.090
 we hide this is bigger is more 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.990
 we have eaten one and found the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.990

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.259
 she's called whore we have to get to the top 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.850
 10 for guys then we have to go 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 eating until you reach the top 10 on 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.229
 moment we are going to be we are tiny 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.360
 but top 10 we need what we can 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.900

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.940
 Japanese

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.269

 eat someone already and I do not want 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.430
 separate because when you part is 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.170
 when the load guys look at l'origine 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.770
 where he has stayed he does not know how 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.569
 to l'origine god that we had 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.650
 had before and look at that is to be lucky 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.650
 Lucky guys 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.190

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.060
 and always abandoned a piece of henry 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.560
 I just want to get to the top 10 I remembered 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:21.000
 of that is that is the center and giant 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.000

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.090
 we are looking for the top 10 colleagues not 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.440
 the pod comes to me this vale we 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.210
 we escaped because he's going to go for that 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.250
 perfect perfect perfect we are that 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.390

 It will not leave ha ha ha 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.909

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.140
 I highly recommend you have the web in the 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.599
 description because I really tell you 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.400
 I recommend it because it's super simple but 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.290
 that prevents you from having some vices in 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.110
 this game while the origin of honor and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.080
 simona origin 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.610
 and we are cornered 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.610
 cornered we are guys 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.900
 comes this fat we are cornered 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.490
 It runs that you run more than the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:21.120
 fat and you know it oh my fucking oz a lot 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.120

 we will show the initials see 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.639
 I'm going to separate played there we're not 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.460
 in the top 10 now the technique is to get 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.580
 here and come back together but it's going to be 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.580
 hard 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.220

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.420

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.960
 come back together 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.129
 and that time I do not know so let's go 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.569
 making time to get together 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.050
 if I want to get together because I think it 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.050

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.170
 for the top 10 in a fox fox fox fox fox 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.470
