little<00:00:31.290> air<00:00:31.680> in<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.149> should<00:00:33.300> look

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
little air in it so it should look

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.400 
little air in it so it should look

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the water is acting like a heatsink and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
the water is acting like a heatsink and
sort<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.579> distributing<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.359> heat

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sort of you know distributing the heat

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
sort of you know distributing the heat
throughout<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> water<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.530> absorbing<00:01:02.010> all

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the heat and that way the rubbers not

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.479 
the heat and that way the rubbers not
bursting<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> did<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.070> lit<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bursting like it did when we lit it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.350 
bursting like it did when we lit it
without<00:01:05.759> any<00:01:06.450> water<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:08.210> now<00:01:09.210> let's
