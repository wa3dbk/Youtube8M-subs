00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello my name is nitro from 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.390
 Luton and Leveln and we have on the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 channel more often the question got where 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.580
 you can be quite easy legendary stuff 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.309
 and this is a place 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.049
 and we are right behind 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.940
 I brought mine for the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.010
 Most of the spot should be known 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.260
 for those who do not know then yes 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 just on the earth then the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.300
 patrol mode then with your lock 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 left over this plane cemetery 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.199
 then drive up this building 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 where he first stepped on the witch 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.730
 Answer by running and then you are 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.070
 right at the start and there is one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.050
 We have to pay attention to a few things here 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.899
 shoot at this all the time 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 spot cave and therefore really the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.700
 whole spore the opponent to when I 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.379
 already really permanent one can 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.750
 just have to keep his magazine on it 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.160
 after loading and in the moment already 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.289
 again afterwards and thereby that here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 so many people kill it like that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 of course you have the ops picture 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 chance quite a lot of legendary stuff 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.769
 to ditch and ditch it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.229
 But there are some things you should be aware of 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.700
 and you have to walk a bit further 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 from the hill with his boxing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 spawn the place where we are right now 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.549
 it is actually optimal 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.560
 You can still get in relatively well 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.990
 shoot and the mobs really bonn 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.060
 permanently behind and it's enough 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 if the five meters of it stands at the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.530
 stone and transport only one in 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.549
 after the place 2 and shortens the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 just in half 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.170
 whatever you notice 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 is that on top of that speaks at this 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.370
 red building above also no running around 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 the monsters do not spawn either 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.270
 So it's best if you really 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 all with your whole team behind it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.100
 are you have no fear that have 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.020
 your team unloaded abuses the lud is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 for everyone there we see a lot of kick 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 get a pure nature ammo and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.800
 all well go there and what they 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.900
 Also note is 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.300
 if you monster out of the cave 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.640
 then from this spot you have to do that 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.619
 afterwards and kill them as soon as possible 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 only one of the spawn group 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.160
 monster from the sport group outside 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.820
 racecarrier also not somewhere 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.369
 more afterwards 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.170
 So you have to be gone all the way 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.060
 monsters always nice to kill those 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 Run and if any which can out 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.870
 but escape afterwards and these too 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
 kill with it all tree group easy 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.520
 new spot that's it family i can 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 hope I've brought what 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.850
 and yes, we'll see each other firmer 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.800
 ask from station the commons loads 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.800
 aigner that's nitro's good
