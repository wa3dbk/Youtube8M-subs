 iquique in the capital of the border region with the third narco-producer 

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:17.130
 of the world 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.339
 what bolivia

 percent and we're also adjacent to the pelvic region which in turn 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.750
 limits with the second was awkward 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.090
 On the other hand, the iqueÃ±os present high levels of victimization according to 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.070
 the surveys show, but Contreras explained that depending on how 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.110
 apply ti make the survey 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.630
 is how this perception is qualified 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.920
 to the other national citizen security survey says it clearly has a 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.430
 high victimization index 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400
 Kings will go to realize 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.030
 that has many people that this is not to be a victim of crime 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.700
 the trafficking of narcotics is a crime that crosses transversally 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.540
 the society 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.400
 In the middle of this activity, if violence comes, intimidation 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.970
 theft and so on 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.250
 can the neighbor know 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 they are clearly not selling that the police do not necessarily know 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.810
 because the police is an effective institution to the area they were code 30 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.350
 officials are unemployed all service the region 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.930
 despite having a system that completely protects the identity of the informant 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.939

 when we detect the power to enter 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.740

 iquique is a step of great importance for drug trafficking in Chile
