00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.060 

that's<00:02:21.060> earlier<00:02:21.450> than<00:02:21.600> my<00:02:21.720> usual<00:02:21.900> screw-up

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.200 

inevitably<00:02:26.070> I'll<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.490> something<00:02:26.730> dumb

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
inevitably I'll do something dumb

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:41.260

between<00:02:27.690> laps<00:02:27.930> four<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.500> six

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.150 

here<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.080> though<00:02:42.290> halfway<00:02:42.800> through<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
here we go though halfway through the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.780 
here we go though halfway through the
race<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.580> we're<00:02:43.700> halfway<00:02:43.850> through<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.390> field

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
race and we're halfway through the field

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.030 
race and we're halfway through the field
it's<00:02:46.790> actually<00:02:47.120> not<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.420> good<00:02:47.720> sign<00:02:48.080> things

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it's actually not a good sign things

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.060 
it's actually not a good sign things
only<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.460> more<00:02:49.640> difficult<00:02:49.880> as<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.500> laps<00:02:51.740> wind

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
only get more difficult as the laps wind

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.230 
only get more difficult as the laps wind
down<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.650> we're<00:02:54.980> we're<00:02:55.460> actually<00:02:55.610> off<00:02:55.910> pace

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
down so we're we're actually off pace

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.750 
down so we're we're actually off pace

eight<00:04:34.780> laps<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:37.060> can<00:04:37.240> increase<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:38.460> to

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
eight laps there you can increase it to
