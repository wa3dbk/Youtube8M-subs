00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 Thank you that many actually it should 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.040
 at tim fork official and now show 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.690
 I you officially officially so I 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.990
 now a great one is just a big one 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.840
 Provider gets a lot of fun 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.849
 Now customers say it or a big one though 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.849
 at black traffic light 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.130
 what would you do then, of course, is extreme 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.130
 important to take good care of 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:01:00.320
 here is the real one here is the first 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.340
 start here last is super first 12 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 I want to pump myself up how should I 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.979
 not on points so I this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 I need the point needs the point 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.509
 so that I play my muscles better 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.180
 that also knows sporty times 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:48.659
 keep playing muscles and the 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:49.799
 Muscle fibers karl it whether karl it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.850
 met at the gym 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:59.990
 actually still an autograph karl s 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 karl it definitely i 'll do that 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.640
 super sets in the case virtually not 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.840
 not complementary with names 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 muscle group but i do that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.370
 same muscles with two minimal 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.770
 claim different exercises 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.450
 I like it because I like it 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.510
 said the pump will get faster and faster 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 the belly stays longer with it 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.020
 Trying it out is always such a thing 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 then we can try something 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.640
 say what you think in the show 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.870
 until then and now people still 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.099
 Sometimes important what we forget to cancel 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.420
 focus is always on exercise 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.910
 number one exercise has number one 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 highest priority in the super set in the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.750
 now why in sentence number one 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.269
 is she up to fail or to her 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.440
 one still in the tank had and then goes 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.450
 now a great set then he goes 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.470
 the pull-ups when the clubs are not anymore 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.629
 creates then she does not manage anymore 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.610
 he could try half 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.310
 to make history of repetitions 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.769
 the sargs Fischeln and but for the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.450
 First , everything has to be smooth and running 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.480
 it needs a thing to the variation so 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.090
 here you can grab demand then 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.430
 the great set but here at the back rum 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.409
 pull your neck when you're in 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.629
 Pulling the train in the neck then sees 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.130
 For this breast the small variations must 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.730
 once as if I had the same 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.870
 after repeat number increase so 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.520
 we have a slightly complementary one 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.320
 burden but not completely complementary 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.130
 burden the muscle groups are relative 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:44.450
 the same was still massively on the way 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:49.530
 wanted to give old banausen something going on 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.770
 I come I should hardly have water at 20 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.210
 kilo 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.420
 Mr. mature 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.420
 why so many are growing up faster 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:12.360
 so simple that was too easy a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.690
 human face from your video 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.690
