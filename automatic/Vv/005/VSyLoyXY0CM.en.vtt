 this time he taught him to prepare the dough 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 of the thread but to make it morphine be 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.130
 much more fun for the kids 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.130

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.970
 not only am I a face a zest of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.939
 and to decorate for a lot of attention without you 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.939
 please chopped nuts 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.400
 mini chocolate kisses to my life 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.840
 nice green cherries 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.659
 be those rocks 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.369
 They are a few and they treat me very well 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.890
 these days on this side I have neither super 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.810
 machine the flour the madness and I already 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.549
 I previously went through a colander to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.530
 avoid getting lumps and leave 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.189
 out there some factory after we go to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.939
 add sugar or supra suÃ©ltate 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:45.560
 sugar let's add the yeast you're going to 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.969
 see that the first four ingredient 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.310
 perfect and then we have flour 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.270
 yeast sugar and then we started 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 mix all eyes 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 on the side I'm going to start mixing yolks and 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.360
 clear 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.640
 together with the orange juice I'm not going 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.770
 adding one by one because what 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 I need is to integrate well if I do not 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.269
 previously integrated the whites together with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 the buds here cost a little more than 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.470
 I work to mix or if I can do it 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.630
 in front I do it then peak all my 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.209
 flames and I start to integrate and there 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 same in this in this in this mix I'm going 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.239
 to add the orange juice once 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.280
 so that everyone enters together 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.110
 now is not exactly looking if 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.549
 He is adding the whites and yolks without 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.829
 mix in advance 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.209
 then you start how to mix for a 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.390
 side the yolks and on the one hand when speaking 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.799
 reproach in exact well integrated but 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.069
 I have to do that from 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.790
 before then to avoid that and what 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.440
 I have also already is now let's 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.329
 start adding the wet ones you can 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
 slow down thanks there I have 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.160
 fear of not making a rather dirty trick 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.240
 to do one please 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.520
 with her and added everything little by little 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.620
 same 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.440
 how I mix it well does not matter horta 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 the speed or how I'm going to add it and 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.070
 there that begins to mix when I 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.050
 achievement and mix the flour point a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.510
 rather the dry ones along with the 12 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.170
 I start adding the butter and 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.670
 then the orange zest 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.920
 today to make orange zest 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.569
 as we do the grated nasa the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.090
 let's drag in fact we're going to 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.620
 scrape with the cheese grater the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.280
 cheese grater a part that 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.739
 scrape exactly how a few more piquitos 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.020
 that when scraping we do not go 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.600
 so deep because the white part of 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.850
 the oranges is very bitter then very 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.700
 superficial for nothing to get the 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.489
 pure bark of orange 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.010
 There is dirty because he dresses very 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.590
 alright I will now add butter and 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.010
 there they begin to incorporate 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.010
 to work 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.890
 and leave it please mix if I already have 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.500
 list a mass when it is integrated 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.330
 perfectly well this mass we are going to 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.739
 put in a bowl we will cover it with 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.379
 plastic and we will be on one side 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.450
 from the kitchen that we do not know is warm 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.729
 which is that it's hot about 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.100
 refrigerator the challenger is cold but for 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.630
 because it's hot I near the stove 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.790
 that is also a bit hot 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.310
 so that the mass begins to grow at 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.050
 ferment when double the size the 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.729
 let's go back to work with your hands 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.010
 and we will have a mass like the one 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.010
 I have here we are going to grab more balls 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.940
 or less like 50-60 grams 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.740
 the ssppc exactly to know that no 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.289
 you are sure of not passing it, let me 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.270
 please not to exceed the size of the 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.400
 molds remained much the molds 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.610
 they go to is a mass that grows a lot 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.260
 they are going to overflow and they are going to unite all of 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.830
 50 to 60 grams and for that I have two of 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.830
 chocolate 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.460
 in the fillings with chocolate kisses 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:14.600
 that fill them we put them in the mold of 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.920
 mobbing because they see you in the middle too 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.680
 you put it in the molds as if we 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.640
 we can bake at 180 degrees and the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.050
 let's leave 20 to 25 minutes maximum 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.300
 30 but already days or we will be 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.910
 browning 20 to 25 minutes does not take them 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.290
 a lot of time they grow immediately and 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.660
 once they have grown we will be left 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.170
 like the ones that I already have here there are several 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.450
 options 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.000
 some fill them with a little bit of 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.310
 chocolate and a little bit of red cherries 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.400
 green roses another nothing else I put them 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.620
 up so he grabs the cherries and he 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.650
 I put them here and they put them in another 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.440
 I did not put anything on them and prepare the shadows 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.780
 that you do nothing else with icing sugar and 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.830
 a little bit of playing a little bit that nothing 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.870
 we bathe them in this way 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.889
 today they are coming out super well me and they 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.040
 we put 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:08.560
 and we put a bit of cherries 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.450
 the quick glass of the stories I do not have 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.370
 amount I just grab it more or less like 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.350
 a cup of icing sugar and I'll go 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.060
 adding a little bit of juice 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.830
 lemon I also do not have the quantities what 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.780
 I'm mixing until a 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.490
 mix like the one that I have here that is 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.470
 thick that is already but I do not have 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.740
 amounts I'm measuring it audited from 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.740
 hoover 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.070
 what I have here then there are several 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.030
 options the one that goes glazed and we put 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.920
 the cherry above 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.900
 another that is filled with chocolate and 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.520
 filling also with cherries or other 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.830
 that nothing else put the cherries up 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.010
 the figs and so many and all are 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.900
 they got to bake at 180 degrees from 20 to 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.090
 25 minutes but apart they look super 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.870
 Christmas the colors as if they were 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.520
 levels but the kids did not jump 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.560
 if you want what you can do 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.560
 is to put a child to the mobile 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.990
 God is not good we put a child to 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.430
 one if one tells us and when we arrive with the 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.430
 tray to see here it was the boy's turn 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.050
 victim
