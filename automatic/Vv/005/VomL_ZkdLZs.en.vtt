so let's try after seeing that all the
keys<00:02:08.259> were<00:02:08.560> perfectly<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.550> just<00:02:11.040> put<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
keys were perfectly we can just put the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.680 
keys were perfectly we can just put the
numbers<00:02:12.550> here<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.530> move<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.709> around<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.370> little

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
numbers here and move it around a little

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.979 
numbers here and move it around a little
you<00:02:16.690> will<00:02:16.780> see<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.080> we<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.440> also<00:02:19.110> use<00:02:21.989> fast

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
you will see that we can also use fast

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.210
