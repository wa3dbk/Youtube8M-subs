 the use given for a day 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.670
 simply what is simple young 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.200
 they would enter the barracks and would pass from one day to the next not a short time 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.330
 integral but simply because a small moon is rock and that life 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.710

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.440
 little military life 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.720

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 river keeper 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.470
 that we always seek integration and 3 our activity 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.920
 military with the people we met and when we found a selected group of 40 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.890
 people 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 I like being the ones who are willing to spend a weekend with us. 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.710
 such measures as those carried out in 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.750
 O 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.570

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.830
 goalkeeper 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.580
 said and said 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.110
 look 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 in the year to years 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.140
 We are part of the preparation 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.919
 About 8:00 p.m. 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.789
 the little hard 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.039
 In the north 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.449
 starting point 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.619
 he was represented 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.619
 at the arrival point on stage 2 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.210
 here not comment 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.200
 promoted by red bernard now that I'm going to lose my partner 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.259
 nothing 90 so far 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.529
 we could not 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.450
 Paulo 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.439
 Paulo 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.439
 I will not speculate 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.579
 I will not speculate 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.889
 on the words forwards that opens the season 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.689
 1 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.689
 Let's get better every day. 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.509
 I quit 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.209
 I'll stop here. 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.489
 it's the most natural thing 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.400
 sure but let's play two years we will come across the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.739
 green party for this 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.739
 but I'm not liking we did not know how 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.659
 it's in your catch 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.989
 after the social greeting 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 the stations are closed 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.849
 the world bank 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.849
 then have fun 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.169
 see here the guess 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.709
 here tomorrow 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.259
 who knows back to power the shooters of the hamas to free the souls 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.550
 with agreement the thesis of caraÃ§as a pared 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.629
 - I've seen everything coming back 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 not 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.080
 this is normal 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 from sexy 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:01.849
 in the great victory 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.360
 even so the opposition a cleaning lady rosangela gavinski does not make sense 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.589
 people looking for 0 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.499
 almost walked out there 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.429
 restrictions on canceled flights is the balance of the company 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.719
 and as an example 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.009
 the Brazilian rural prosegur the deadline for the presentation 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.819
 honduras is a wound that I do not know if we are well we create our own 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.330
 body supported in alagoas 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.490
 the red-black club in the plenary 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.490
 and that sometimes 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:49.039
 not
