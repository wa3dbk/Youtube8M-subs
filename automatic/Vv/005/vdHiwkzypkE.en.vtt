00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.220
 So Fritsche to Siemens Computers last year on the CD already in the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.920
 oil bath already held in the oil bath Monitor Cologne and this year bring with the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 Garbage Watt more targeted too 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.979
 With this 0 watt monitor the Vagag PC both products are capable of 

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:24.560
 so-called stent in case of loss or a PC which completely out of losses too 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.689
 Usually, such products have a power consumption of 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.210
 about 1 to 5 watts depending on how old the products are 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 and you can reduce those 1 to 5 ATGs as well 0 Barca is not 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.740
 he does not need any power anymore but he needs it 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
 we have shown here extra time Trier darts meter 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.420
 and two completely identical monitors on one monitor you can see here 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.660
 a slightly darker percent and on the other monitor a very bright picture 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 and she worked out scenes and very bright percent the energy consumption of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.130
 Stocker 71 72 watts compared to the somewhat darker monitor of 47 wait 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.850
 that means alone by reducing the brightness of a book 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.180
 you can drastically reduce the energy consumption of a monitor 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.010
 we have been shipping to these ecomotives since october anyway 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.220
 at most 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.590
 but do not know that you can adjust the brightness and how 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.140
 can imagine and that's why it's better all customers get one 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 reduced brightness and thus in the CDU n-energy 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.570
 then there is this automatic sensor plate open is there you can 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.060
 Automatically adjust the brightness depending on the ambient light and 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.960
 so that it also reduces my energy 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.150
 then come to the new Pact PC 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.870
 in which one turns on and off in the 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.900
 Normally, number one comma says it wanted to sell 7 watts of this product 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.410
 you will see this product now 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.440
 and automatically to 0 watts of food behaves exactly as if they had 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.050
 the right set a breaker to disconnect it from the grid like a pike 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.460
 pull plug 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.750
 Here is the special thing about the PC that just administrates company woar computers 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.590
 Of course that does not work because you have the opportunity 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.440
 in one act - tractor time window to let the calculator plug in and this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.820
 Time to administer and still access to the computer
