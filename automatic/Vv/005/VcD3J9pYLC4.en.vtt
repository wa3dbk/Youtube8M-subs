00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 quite ok in any case a small 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.460
 berghof but korso plan he is not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.370
 over there we ride silos device 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.110
 halls shelters under baar device the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.960
 is definitely nice already there 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.620
 even up there, it continues 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 masterpiece fold there's going up there where 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.539
 Friends I think a knife found 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.020
 unfortunately it is not high or visited 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.710
 the monastery is also looking for the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 rediscovered toilet seat before the hammer 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 really epic but paid down like 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.369
 the nice romp can be another 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.970
 do things as with low lids 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.250
 hide 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 but unfortunately we have nobody with it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.909
 because of that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.790
 Simply warm us now our times 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 City vehicle originated at Kramer BÃ¼hrer 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.600
 Lindner and pretty nice city vehicles 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.710
 not too much, not too fast 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.729
 works have I personally like 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.740
 extremly good 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.100
 we are looking around for a few friends and 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.240
 Unfortunately, the web does not do that much for us 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.240
 description is it is a pity 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.229
 really the orientation carries the map 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.280
 and unfortunately not in the pda 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.079
 do not be much better 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.700
 as I said that's a pity but we 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.899
 they will change then we can drive 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.450
 Just let it go a bit 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.630
 would web and look worried 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.390
 really that many austrians 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.569
 Tyrol has is Europe cheap knock-offs 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.899
 So double down or even just 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:09.250
 even caught up and down 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.530
 pretty much driving on the alm 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.000
 Cool definitely needs that one 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.860
 there almost the court there is always only 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.810
 a sure friend before mainz 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.790
 technically is really great because there is nothing 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.069
 to complain 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.290
 there is not at all he just has to 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.959
 I'm not sure if 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.959
 not only why we film set on 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.030
 base and if you want a field 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.739
 obviously and that was it then 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.829
 that's why he raised the top of her 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:44.859
 there their top team without stars at 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.200
 driver among them again and friends in front 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.840
 everything left I have somehow 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.970
 just become the dull feeling friend 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 just as a hobby is now actually 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.459
 just as hop in the moment a dull feeling 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.370
 it looks like a hiking day through the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.269
 mountains to the idea and of itself 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.250
 pretty awesome 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.269
 that was there alps w brought and so 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.690
 on and on 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.790
 the problem she was hobbys me now 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.480
 I would like and quotes 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.489
 that you pick yourself out at least already 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.140
 it's very cool that you can do this 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:28.359
 put typical meadows wood where you can 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.010
 a unimog can work again 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.109
 For example, that's pretty cool 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.290
 We have fields down there in the middle 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.680
 the map of the majority behind quasi us 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.960
 Look down there from setting right 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.490
 also get introduced there now 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.610
 nothing else comes that pretty much 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.830
 monotonous is because only on this mountain 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.150
 because of the drive that is maybe 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.790
 everything to everyone's taste 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.470
 but we look the direction is right 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 already have ahead and lecture that 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.720
 is just very cool in any case 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.790
 bosman form just a bit back then 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.710
 including because there is also a meadow 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.900
 Locally it's fix on the morning right 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.730
 I like that so I love it and 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.470
 We have a few fields below 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.200
 I just believe that the website is that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.810
 simply much welds the future 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.190
 web official webs huge web tinkers 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.120
 is probably our jaw we 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.400
 magna off 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.190
 a small alps will definitely be 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.750
 and we have a beautiful view 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.490
 friends teacher of god little description 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.080
 said on such motors tips hard 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.400
 describe what you have is English 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.550
 that does not matter 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.460
 we see as web and how does that find 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.810
 every rest server has to be steep 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.830
 is cool is a 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.470
 so it is quasi download and 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.730
 server to discover and we have 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.850
 have a quick test now if you 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.200
 at least have activated procedure or 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:58.130
 the swiss harmonious picture collecting 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:00.540
 unfortunately got away now not at all 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.400
 clean ferrari down shortly 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.940
 whether that really is lost 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.940
 hard to say 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:31.159
 where this is a bit steep on everyone 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:38.210
 case so it seems so worth it lost 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:38.210
 so that's always short 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.300
 so obviously is lost 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.280
 disabled that's pretty cool 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.990
 alpen app is definitely i have 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.270
 times worse lowered came on each 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.150
 case why network anyway only 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.180
 this version 1.04 will still be 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.669
 came with versions come with a 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.180
 nice map when that's possible but 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.110
 otherwise 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.949
 In any case , it's pretty cool then 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.949
 to the next friends
