a folding bike for travel you want it to

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.640 
a folding bike for travel you want it to
have<00:05:27.030> 16<00:05:27.540> inch<00:05:27.720> wheels<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.440> come<00:05:28.620> back

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
have 16 inch wheels so it can come back

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.710 
have 16 inch wheels so it can come back
to<00:05:28.860> compact<00:05:29.460> down<00:05:29.670> even<00:05:30.000> smaller<00:05:30.030> than<00:05:30.450> this

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
to compact down even smaller than this

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.200 
to compact down even smaller than this
um<00:05:30.960> those<00:05:31.830> four<00:05:32.040> inches<00:05:32.280> are<00:05:32.490> significant

um those four inches are significant
difference<00:05:33.510> in<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.720> size<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.170> bus<00:05:34.320> you

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
difference in the size of the bus you

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.040 
difference in the size of the bus you
feel<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.740> weight<00:05:34.890> of<00:05:34.980> the<00:05:35.040> bike<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:36.050> yeah
