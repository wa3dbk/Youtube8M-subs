00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello this is lucie my project 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.429
 today is to perform a transplant 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.110
 English on the table among the different 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.130
 transplant techniques this one is the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 simpler to achieve 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.380
 it is also the most effective because 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.000
 it offers a better recovery 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 the English graft must be between 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 March and mid April 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.710
 watch out greece is getting ready as soon as 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.769
 january we'll see it in the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.810
 next to strike the table 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.120
 we need a pruner of a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.670
 well-honed graft of rubber bands 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.950
 grafted or raffia and a wax has 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 grafted all these tools are found 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.879
 easily in the shops 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 specialized to understand the 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.789
 technical gestures I went to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 regional conservatory orchard at 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.870
 villeneuve d'ascq where frédéric 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 crrg technicians will show us the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.340
 precise gestures the possible strikes are 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.770
 forked on apple tree pear on pear trees 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.629
 cherry on cherry and plum on 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.280
 plum tree the first thing to do is to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.369
 take a graft on the tree of the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.510
 variety that we wish to multiply 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.400
 take several branches of one year 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 of the desired variety in the month of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.159
 January 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.590
 ideally of a diameter equivalent to one 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.090
 pencil will sail funds must 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 to be buried three- quarters in the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.070
 earth or in sand north for 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.330
 keep their humidity 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 if you take several varieties 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 think about the labels and nails to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.979
 from early March to mid April 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.210
 we will be able to attack the graft 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 frédéric has recovered the grafts put in 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.380
 plays he also brought the door 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.150
 bare root graft 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280
 be careful when choosing the door 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
 transplant it is essential to know his 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.110
 adaptation to soil and climate its 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.670
 hardiness and vigor 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.899
 for more information do not hesitate to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.149
 watch our episode 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.649
 how to choose a fruit tree we 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.540
 let's start by preparing the door 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.850
 graft 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.950
 for that we will cut 20 cm 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.590
 above the roots with your 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.690
 pruner makes a bevel cut to 45 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.400
 degrees 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.410
 be sure to see a list part 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.120
 that is without buds on the side of 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.040
 bevel 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.740
 then using the graft makes a cut 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.020
 frank 2 to 3 cm on the side of the game 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.030
 high bevel to remove the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.770
 Corsican 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.780
 finally one millimeter from the top 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.390
 of the graft carried a slit 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.330
 longitudinal 2 to 3 cm long 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.590
 up to one-third of its diameter 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.400
 you can now rest your 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.150
 graft 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.070
 we will prepare the graft for help 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.530
 the graft makes a bevel cut 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120
 starting behind an eye the size 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.700
 oblique must have an inclination 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.480
 about 20 degrees with a length of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.700
 2 to 3 cm then count three eyes and 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.200
 cut the other end of the graft into 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.200
 oblique at 45 degrees 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.549
 on the beveled part makes a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.560
 notch to one-third of the bevel on leaving 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.659
 from the tip 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.950
 from this level made a slot 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.720
 longitudinal 2 to 3 cm long 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.939
 we can now finalize our 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
 English greece by embedding the graft 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.959
 in the rootstock does it well 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.150
 be careful that the respective parties 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.519
 graft and fat port 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.370
 between the Corsican and the marrow is well 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.290
 in contact like that once the transplant 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.709
 made ligate with an elastic 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.819
 to consolidate the assembly 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.950
 finally you will only have to deceive 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.629
 your strike in melted wax on fire 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.549
 soft to strengthen the points of 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.620
 contact and avoid drying out 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.540
 graft 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.909
 soak your strike a first time and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.859
 wait a few moments then a 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.170
 second time to avoid any bubbles 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.620
 of air he did not forget to put a 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.569
 label with the name of the variety 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.340
 this is your table strike is over 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.139
 immediately after planting the door 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.389
 Graft graft into clean soil 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.099
 after that you will have to cut 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.199
 regular rejection of the graft 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.660
 when the shoots of the graft will have 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.940
 reaches 5 cm fold the least beautiful 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.319
 shoots and keep the most beautiful that 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.540
 is usually the highest 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.780
 it is she who will constitute the trunk of 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.490
 your tree 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.080
 put a twitter on which you 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.180
 attach the shoot as they 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.330
 grow the shoot must be well 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.240
 right there are three essential points 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.220
 for a successful transplant levy 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.010
 in the month of January and keep 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.930
 the goods were good and corso against 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.690
 bark the two respective parts of the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.669
 graft and graft and finally 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.430
 regularly maintain your transplant 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.360
 after planting soon for a 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.360
 new episode in the orchard
