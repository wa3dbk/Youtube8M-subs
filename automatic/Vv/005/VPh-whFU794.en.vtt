00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.730
 You sure know the simpsons? 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.950
 one of the longest-running series of the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.380
 world tv is one of my favorites 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.029
 also loves sims it stands to reason that if you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 Do not live on Mars, surely you already 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.300
 did you hear about the simpsons? 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.550
 But have you ever wondered why they 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.579
 they're yellow it 's a silly thing but 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.430
 I stopped to think today, david silver. 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.290
 Mei is the guy responsible for color and all 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.980
 the characters in the series 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.750
 in an interview in 1998 and 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 explained why the characters 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.710
 to be take is light also explained why 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.620
 of bart lisa imagine they have a line 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.930
 to separate the hair from the forehead to the case 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.780
 their skin color was more realistic 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.500
 it was not going to be a nice thing to do. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.720
 to see 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.790
 then there is online method that is the 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.380
 creator of the series was there that decided that 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.840
 the characters were yellow because 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.549
 besides helping in their appearance is 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.430
 something totally different from 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.960
 Anything at the time, that was clear. 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.240
 draw close attention because all the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.859
 human characters back then had 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 traditional colors is skin color 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:25.399
