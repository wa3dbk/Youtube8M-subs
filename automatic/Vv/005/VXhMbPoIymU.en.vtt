00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.320
 one of the most anticipated innovations in 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.400
 adobe camera raw 7 has become an appearance on 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.350
 channel curves if earlier in the process 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.250
 2010 we could only manage 1 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.380
 composite rgb curve then now we 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.060
 we can manage each channel 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.850
 red green and blue respectively 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.999
 will switch and curves 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.460
 it enables the user to himself 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:40.069
 channel correction 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.429
 the truth should be said that for now this 

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:45.409
 The tool is not brought to mind because 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.550
 curves don't work here at all like 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.979
 in photoshop 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.670
 but they can be used to create 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.109
 different effects on the image 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.839
 for example if you like cross 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.030
 processing or from instagram here 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.220
 you can completely break some such 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.690
 color is the simplest example 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.620
 do something like a cross 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.620
 processing here please already applied 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.200
 some effect 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:23.020
 let's do the same thing in green 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.170
 the channel here is already another effect 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.950
 finally add the blue channel also 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.600
 a little workout can be still here. 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.600
 omit this point 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:45.590
 and finally so that we do not have such 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:48.439
 here is the deep money curve rgb can 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.009
 raise the black point make the shadows more 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.009
 soft 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.689
 well make any such form 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.079
 lower the white point a little here we are 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.329
 got one of the toning options 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.049
 images and of course she is a bit 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.519
 harsh but the general direction is correct 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.459
 if necessary, a little 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.310
 reduce saturation so that it is not 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.790
 rushed eyes and now we get 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.870
 more interesting picture like this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.579
 the image was not like that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 here is one use case for 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.860
 try channel curves 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 experiment and get yours 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.120
 color combinations 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.049
 you were Evgeny Kartashov before the meeting 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.049
 in the following lessons
