00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.269
 for each student has been assessed 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.350
 the offense before Willich 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.350
 again in this case ready 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.320
 I do not have that tickle right now 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.039
 Heldt already had Zetsche 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.829
 counted one week 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 and of course I do not tell you that 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.699
 No, I've got it 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.249
 m 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.390
 what does he say to you? 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.759
 be against it 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.759
 then married and that is still possible 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.580
 and this is my first time as a dancer and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.610
 if they are not enough they would have changed 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.470
 and 10 are trying to 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.780
 First, I had changed a base coat and that is the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.420
 Kingston are engaged in these countries 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.160
 The main focus is he is very rare 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.120
 He made it clear that Merkel too 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.570
 really nice flat 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.140
 and around 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.450
 is optimal for a nail polish 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.700
 as I prepare for it 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.110
 I suspected that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.140
 because 1 Henrike b is on 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.930
 not even one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200
 a very nice one 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.330
 Women had long suspected 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 This is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.190
 Vienna 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.640
 Everyone knows that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.760
 that's him 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.460
 otherwise I am 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.400
 Merkel has in color 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.050
 now fell 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.730
 Chocolate chip 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.530
 and not just one not used 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.710
 many do not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.600
 So I find the destination 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.680
 Great and advise directly to the train a layer of success and art 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 the 5-star 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.100
 Ralf Schöll let it dry so really 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.880
 the really well dried up place 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.290
 more 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
 Neustadt 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.499
 a vessel Straumann I've taken a plastic bowl now 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.499
 that is a 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.729
 that they are not old and had fun 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.119
 Bezina Franz 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:22.229
 seawater 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.229
 and thus her team with its natural beauties 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.010
 Therefore, he has to be noted on the signature remarkable that I again 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.859
 everything 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.679
 staged 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.259
 yes, then I have none 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 Toothpick consumed 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.589
 Nail polish remover very important really cheap way 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.399
 but ready for action 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.449
 and 2 cotton buds 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.399
 among other things, I have 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.549
 had erratic Merkel 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.139
 in small steps 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.099
 for men 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.539
 for the thermal water 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.539
 and that is for 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.769
 the p2 r 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.869
 Colourbox 10 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:10.149
 Merkel Lane 42 Scheifele files 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.999
 that's a really nice one 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.079
 a 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.209
 the success is 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.789
 I would say 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.330
 the student has to exploit 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.500
 I think that's really great and does not harmonize badly 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.909
 with ten percent 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.769
 So I find in Liechtenstein 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.189
 at least under the microscope 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.379
 nail polish 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.450
 The ESA does not even have such a real German construction industry in a tailspin 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.219
 Wyk gives 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:38.609
 then I have a top pick in Munich with 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.570
 fit and shoot for the living room 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.249
 the city a bit sorry 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.360
 very forward 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.579
 Pauli was in no time 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 a sensitive Snell Collenberg 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.049
 Stevan r made a very normal smacking 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.229
 No 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.229
 which now has the number 3 6 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.119
 not changed 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.399
 then you prepare it 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:11.989
 and sin 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.379
 Eminem is about then look at you video is now on 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.999
 currently Ilja Richters watchful draft ruler 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.520
 I find it very difficult 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.389
 Iron ore fell well 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.669
 other sponsorships or just the rebel leader 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.180
 at least 1 million 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.129
 Percent 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.330
 I think it's nice 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.330
 grow noticeably to 10 of course 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.800
 Oh, what I forgot 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.219
 if the motive is then dried out properly 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.729
 and will be ready in a few days 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.789
 then 8 percent associates an over lay that is ticking very differently 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.289
 that extends the shelf life percent 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.240
 everything only targets a paint and percent protects it 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.979
 Dan Marks then I wish him a lot of fun now 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:06.909
 on 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.229
 Video 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.059
 and 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.059
 See you soon 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.670
 I use si colors black and 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.559
 by private 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.870
 then it goes to 1 4 percent 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.839
 on the water surface 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.749
 next went and goes too far 214 strips 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.800
 a drop 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.990
 without OTE 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.509
 presumably from outside to inside with the toothpick struck 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.879
 5 draw to a pattern 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.879
 a desired pattern is created 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.139
 Nail surface on the dream pattern you want to give up 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.289
 because beautiful dared something 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.099
 the firm 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.069
 Water surface in Schmidmühlen was easy to take with the toothpick 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.870
 and Schmidt a hard fought the town 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.849
 the 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.729
 "This is a breakthrough 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.119
 problematic 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:15.749
 Here I show you now 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.020
 Another nail design the b-team received 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.020
 Colors have used sorry 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.410
 this pattern is different than you can not 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.080
 anyway 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.369
 always the same pattern percent linz09 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:34.339
 it's always different 

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:38.589
 and that knew that I would have to report crater report for me now 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:39.819
 most 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.629
 and around 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:45.839
 last agreed 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:47.300
 the entire logistics 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.189
 quite a doll is important the knee has 1 letter at the markets 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.869
 and the rest 

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.570
 in the coolest market 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.599
 the parking of the car is not right 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.270
 remove with the toothpick 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.270
 Now I have a clear view of studying 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:09.349
 selected there I give it some clear coat on it 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:15.309
 the Christians their customers 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.330
 and on 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.469
 Granting the golden dress says brother 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.219
 they had to enter the cemetery 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:24.070
 to the 10th 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.330
 such a racer nail polish percent manufacturer 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.960
 in the cultural institute siblings beautiful and prominent the thread 

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:36.159
 No 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.639
 really good 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.220
 It should be quite easy for me now with one 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.110
 while hurt you can but also 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.330
 make the gentlemen 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.860
 Toothpick minutes 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.860
 so and now it's only on terrorists 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.309
 watchful and scripture around 

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:55.819
 small 

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:57.830
 at half past twelve and two 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.039
 in the form of points 

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:03.080
 and it is very beautiful 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.899
 instead of as a rhinestone you can tip over 

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:07.579
 Not
