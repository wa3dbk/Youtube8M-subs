a flat surface because that is a little
bit<00:04:30.980> trickier<00:04:31.400> than<00:04:31.480> doing<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.600> drawer<00:04:32.960> so

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
bit trickier than doing a drawer so

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.050 
bit trickier than doing a drawer so
you're<00:04:33.260> going<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.440> see<00:04:33.650> more<00:04:33.890> of<00:04:34.130> your<00:04:34.310> strokes

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
you're going to see more of your strokes

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.810 
you're going to see more of your strokes
and<00:04:35.330> everything<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:37.220> again<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.970> get<00:04:38.630> some<00:04:38.870> wax

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
and everything so again I get some wax

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.900 
and everything so again I get some wax
off<00:04:40.820> your<00:04:41.060> plate<00:04:41.330> rub<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.580> wipe<00:04:43.580> off<00:04:43.730> any

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
off your plate rub it in wipe off any

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.490 
off your plate rub it in wipe off any
excess<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.630> when<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.870> have<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.020> flat<00:04:45.200> surface

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
excess and when you have a flat surface

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.310 
excess and when you have a flat surface
like<00:04:46.100> this<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.550> really<00:04:46.850> work<00:04:47.060> it<00:04:47.180> in<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:48.169> can

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
like this to really work it in you can

00:04:48.320 --> 00:05:00.800 
like this to really work it in you can
do<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:49.030> circular<00:04:50.030> motion

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.320 

on<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.500> sides<00:05:01.770> it's<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.130> lot<00:05:02.280> easier<00:05:02.520> on<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.030> flat

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
on the sides it's a lot easier on a flat

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.000 
on the sides it's a lot easier on a flat
surface<00:05:03.750> like<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.230> lot<00:05:04.380> easier<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.800> see

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
surface like this is a lot easier to see

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.410 
surface like this is a lot easier to see
where<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.310> come<00:05:05.520> back<00:05:05.730> somewhere<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.300> don't

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
where you come back somewhere you don't

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.590 
where you come back somewhere you don't
have<00:05:06.630> works<00:05:07.220> but<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.370> will<00:05:08.520> see<00:05:08.850> like<00:05:09.150> little

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
have works but you will see like little

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.170 
have works but you will see like little
balls<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:10.470> wax<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.430> don't<00:05:11.520> want<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:11.820> see<00:05:11.970> any

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
balls of wax and I don't want to see any

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.490 
balls of wax and I don't want to see any
of<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.389> so<00:05:12.750> I'm<00:05:12.930> just<00:05:13.110> going<00:05:13.290> to<00:05:13.320> keep

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
of that so I'm just going to keep

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.850 
of that so I'm just going to keep
rubbing<00:05:14.270> rubbing<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.540> in<00:05:15.720> until<00:05:16.230> I<00:05:16.260> don't<00:05:16.380> see

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
rubbing rubbing it in until I don't see

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.390 
rubbing rubbing it in until I don't see
any<00:05:17.790> of<00:05:17.970> those<00:05:18.060> globs<00:05:18.510> anymore<00:05:19.190> as<00:05:20.190> you<00:05:20.280> can

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
any of those globs anymore as you can

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.250 
any of those globs anymore as you can
see<00:05:20.580> I'm<00:05:20.669> going<00:05:20.820> all<00:05:21.180> over<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.750> do<00:05:21.930> a<00:05:21.960> circular

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
see I'm going all over I do a circular

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.280 
see I'm going all over I do a circular
motion<00:05:22.919> and<00:05:23.790> then<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.120> do<00:05:24.180> some<00:05:24.870> back<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.200> forth

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
motion and then I do some back and forth

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.140 
motion and then I do some back and forth
just<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:26.040> it's<00:05:26.190> getting<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.550> every

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
just so that it's getting in every

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.520 
just so that it's getting in every
single<00:05:27.889> part<00:05:28.889> of<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.160> feet<00:05:32.990> and<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.350> the

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
single part of that feet and this is the

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.440 
single part of that feet and this is the
this<00:05:34.919> is<00:05:34.980> like<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.669> thing<00:05:35.880> that's<00:05:36.120> different

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
this is like the thing that's different

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.210 
this is like the thing that's different
from<00:05:36.630> latex<00:05:37.080> does<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:37.650> look<00:05:37.890> you're<00:05:38.100> getting

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
from latex does this look you're getting

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.700 
from latex does this look you're getting
with<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.580> wax<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:39.450> paint<00:05:39.750> really<00:05:40.110> absorbs

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
with the wax the paint really absorbs

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.190 
with the wax the paint really absorbs
into<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.190> wood<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:42.000> latex<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.720> feel<00:05:42.960> like<00:05:43.080> it

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
into the wood with latex I feel like it

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.890 
into the wood with latex I feel like it
just<00:05:43.410> looks<00:05:43.560> like<00:05:43.710> it's<00:05:43.950> sitting<00:05:44.160> on<00:05:44.400> top<00:05:44.900> and

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
just looks like it's sitting on top and

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.010 
just looks like it's sitting on top and
latex<00:05:46.290> looks<00:05:46.590> really<00:05:47.240> plasticky<00:05:48.240> once<00:05:48.810> it's

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
latex looks really plasticky once it's

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.600 
latex looks really plasticky once it's
dry<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.890> this<00:05:50.520> wax<00:05:50.850> just<00:05:51.240> gives<00:05:51.570> it<00:05:51.750> this

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
dry and this wax just gives it this

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.260 
dry and this wax just gives it this
gorgeous<00:05:54.290> fish<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:58.560> a<00:05:58.979> sheen<00:05:59.340> that<00:05:59.820> doesn't

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
gorgeous fish and a sheen that doesn't

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.909 
gorgeous fish and a sheen that doesn't
look<00:06:00.330> classic<00:06:00.870> but<00:06:01.020> paint<00:06:01.290> looks<00:06:01.530> like<00:06:01.740> it's

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
look classic but paint looks like it's

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.150 
look classic but paint looks like it's
part<00:06:02.160> of<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.550> piece<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:04.320> again<00:06:04.590> while<00:06:04.800> my<00:06:04.919> wax

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160
