00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 hi defines so here is plays movies have 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.500
 quickly made my head rolled at hairdresser's 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 I have a good appointment in ten minutes 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.619
 no, and I wanted to show you 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.340
 illzach to do a little before a loan 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.520
 my head believed me mhp are until then 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 good genes frankly even more a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.559
 color I'm not super and well a polar 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.470
 coloring with red highlights as 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.600
 he ate it is these mornings I 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'm almost not wearing makeup or nothing 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 but here I wanted to show you a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.670
 little step for it looks like so I 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 will change the color I change you 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.920
 the cup I'm going to change a lot of things 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.070
 and eva and I show you there if everything is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.070
 the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.730
 Hello 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.250
 I then here I come out of 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:15.760
 at the hairdresser and they see you the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.610
 difference so already the cup changes 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.990
 so she made a gradient 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.150
 I look in the mirror at the same 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.200
 time a I look at the rendering of 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.900
 the device in the mirror is very 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.030
 complicated so she 'll do some 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.650
 gravel like these he made me a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060
 fringe who good now she's a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.500
 little bulging because she did it at the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.850
 pin but otherwise it's a little bit 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.590
 for me I do not count by a little less 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.410
 a good tea but she did not make a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.479
 frank degrade too so I do not know 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.860
 if you have good but it is degraded 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.890
 the momentum that it's not all three 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.270
 shovels really does like that and and 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.630
 here is unfortunately a lot to cut in the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.690
 length 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.040
 I know he's still young 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.990
 maybe cut a little bit more 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.520
 big next time a little bit 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.369
 kind of so far see maybe we got 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.850
 still still will not bother but I 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.979
 dream 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.710
 I think it's a length that's 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.899
 pretty pretty so here you will tell me if 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 It's a good idea 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.350
 so here she made me one of the bunches 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.420
 and and at the same time she maps and two 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.239
 colors end of colas a color and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 wicks so in fact we did you have 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.100
 shown just before I have a reflection 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.360
 red gray in the hair because 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.190
 yes in fact it's red it's where 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.610
 as my hairdresser says 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.050
 ah that I do not like at all and so that I 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.950
 would really like to leave but 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.480
 apparently it must be done in 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.560
 many times because it's a reflection 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.209
 which is very difficult to make 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.959
 forgiveness and I was through his 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.959
 emotions but so that's actually she 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.140
 made me an ash blond colossus and the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.890
 ash blonde locks a little lighter 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.420
 but it gives when we share exactly 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.150
 what I would like you to do is 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.310
 really clearer than that 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.350
 very really where it is 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.019
 like jelly says lance andrÃ© with 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.310
 ash blonde locks more clear so I 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.320
 you might put a picture in 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.570
 do what I want it will be more 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.570
 simple that only words 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.310
 and therefore see that this reflection spring 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.570
 still a little bit my ya anyway 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.580
 a color difference which I believe 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.990
 I see anyway slight me I see 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.060
 still a difference a little bit 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.560
 it's a little less wheels so you see 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.220
 I know you're showing a little more 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 close in fact 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.770
 is not it obvious and also the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.120
 concern I had was that I had a 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.420
 color not very long ago but a 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.370
 color a brand store that's there 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.050
 I had you elsewhere but the video 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.920
 I will put you the link if you wanted 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.420
 and so as I had a root effect 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.700
 the color has more accurate so it's more 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.290
 clear but hey she told me that 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.750
 was going to lighten up so it embarrasses me 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.750
 no and that's the next time so in 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.890
 a month I intend to redo wicks 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.660
 story that it clears up a still 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.450
 little bit and always actually remove this 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.070
 reflection and why not yet cut but 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.900
 until then for the sum please anyway 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.850
 and I hope you enjoy it too 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.070
 You'll tell me what you think about it 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.970
 and he sees there and I tell you see you soon 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.630
 in any video 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.630
 Hi 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.620
 or
