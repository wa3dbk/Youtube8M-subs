the<00:01:08.610> foot<00:01:08.909> has<00:01:09.119> made<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> gather<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:10.110> each

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the foot has made a gather with each

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.789 
the foot has made a gather with each
stitch<00:01:11.540> now<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> change<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
stitch now we're going to change it to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.850 
stitch now we're going to change it to
once<00:01:14.250> every<00:01:14.729> six<00:01:15.060> stitches<00:01:15.330> by<00:01:16.290> lifting<00:01:16.560> the

once every six stitches by lifting the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.840 
once every six stitches by lifting the
arm<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.400> moving<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> over<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.869> slot<00:01:19.290> and

arm and moving it over one slot and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
arm and moving it over one slot and
we'll<00:01:20.850> tighten<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> screw<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.259> deepen<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
we'll tighten the screw to deepen the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.450 
we'll tighten the screw to deepen the
pleats<00:01:24.080> feed<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:25.290> fabric<00:01:25.710> through<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> slit

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
pleats feed your fabric through the slit

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
pleats feed your fabric through the slit
and<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.020> machine<00:01:28.440> makes<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.890> gather

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and now the machine makes it gather

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.810 
and now the machine makes it gather
every<00:01:29.610> six<00:01:29.970> stitches<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:32.369> distance

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
every six stitches at this distance

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.029 
every six stitches at this distance
apart<00:01:33.330> these<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.170> considered<00:01:34.320> pleats

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
apart these would be considered pleats

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.919 
apart these would be considered pleats
rather<00:01:35.700> than<00:01:35.970> gathers<00:01:37.880> now<00:01:38.880> we'll<00:01:39.149> change<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
rather than gathers now we'll change to

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.469 
rather than gathers now we'll change to
one<00:01:40.140> gather<00:01:40.470> every<00:01:40.920> twelve<00:01:41.280> stitches<00:01:41.580> by

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
one gather every twelve stitches by

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.469 
one gather every twelve stitches by
moving<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> third<00:01:43.890> slot<00:01:44.479> will

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
moving this to the third slot will

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
moving this to the third slot will
deepen<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> gathers<00:01:46.319> even<00:01:46.679> more<00:01:46.950> by<00:01:47.580> turning

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
deepen the gathers even more by turning

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.590 
deepen the gathers even more by turning
the<00:01:48.179> screw<00:01:49.190> feed<00:01:50.190> your<00:01:50.369> fabric<00:01:50.789> into<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.300> slit

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the screw feed your fabric into the slit

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.190 
the screw feed your fabric into the slit
and<00:01:51.810> begin<00:01:52.590> sewing<00:01:53.090> your<00:01:54.090> pleats<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.750> set

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and begin sewing your pleats are set

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.550 
and begin sewing your pleats are set
even<00:01:55.740> further<00:01:56.069> apart
