00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 Hello, everyone, GO Che. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.640
 I am 启koda Taiwan Marketing Director Cai Qizheng 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 I am very honored to introduce to you this new car Škoda Fabia. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.680
 This car is equipped with a 1.2TSI in-cylinder direct injection turbocharged engine. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.220
 A total of 110hp/4,600-5,600rpm can be generated 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 This car is equipped with a 1.2TSI in-cylinder direct injection turbocharged engine 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.620
 With two sections of plateau 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 The first section of the plateau is at 1,500-4,000 rpm 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.760
 It has the greatest torque 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.100
 So this car can maintain a fairly high torque from 1500 rpm. 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 Not only easy to open but the other is fuel efficient 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.130
 Unlike the previous car, it has a second section of the plateau 4,500-5,500 rpm. 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.770
 Maintain maximum horsepower of 110hp 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.990
 It can maintain a maximum horsepower of 1000 rpm 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.710
 So you are equal to enjoying the pleasure of the back. 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 This car is basically a chassis of a PQ26. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 The chassis of the next generation of Flowserve Group PQ26 plus the integration of MQB's entire module 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.790
 So almost 90% of it is redesigned 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.910
 The biggest difference in the appearance of this car is that it is 9 cm wider than the previous generation. 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.460
 The roof is 3 cm shorter 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.260
 If it is 3 cm shorter, it is lowered because of the chassis. 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.770
 So the space inside the car is completely unaffected 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580
 After the car width is increased by 9 cm, not only the car becomes more stable. 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.330
 The most important thing is the space inside the car. 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.430
 The space on the elbow has increased by more than 2 cm. 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.030
 The arm space has increased more 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.950
 The storage space for the door is available for options. 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.660
 We have 1.6 natural intake engines to choose from in addition to 1.2. 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.920
 That car is in addition to its power system. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 The other one is its appearance 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.930
 It has the appearance of two different colors of yellow and black. 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.660
 Appearance color can be set with 125 options personal options 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.190
 Our blackened aluminum ring is also part of the overall color selection. 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.930
 It means that you can choose a color in addition to the original car color. 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.650
 It can be used by the original factory to help you match the color of your car and the mirror. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.070
 Fully personalized with the same color as the car 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.110
 There is another one that is its blackened headlights. 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.530
 It is the original black-headed fish headlights and daytime running lights. 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.450
 These things are generally not equipped with these things at this level. 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 Next, it has the option of the entire glass roof of this car. 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.420
 So the panoramic glass roof and the three-color interior of the denim inside it are available. 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.630
 Leather steering wheel equipped with journey computer 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.160
 The journey computer contains your driving history and the current driving status of the car. 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.640
 Seen on the journey computer 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.700
 And assistance for getting uphill 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.080
 The words of these things are for this car. 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.630
 It’s not the usual car 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.180
