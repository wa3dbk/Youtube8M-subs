Croatia<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.760> of<00:04:36.940> course<00:04:37.150> cameroon<00:04:37.870> the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
Croatia and of course cameroon the

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.100 
Croatia and of course cameroon the
african<00:04:38.830> representatives<00:04:39.520> now<00:04:39.730> i<00:04:40.000> think

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
african representatives now i think

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.900 
african representatives now i think
personally<00:04:41.110> i'd<00:04:41.920> say<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.460> they'd<00:04:42.580> finished

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
personally i'd say that they'd finished

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.910 
personally i'd say that they'd finished
third<00:04:43.240> in<00:04:43.480> that<00:04:43.690> group<00:04:43.900> obviously<00:04:44.500> you'd<00:04:44.770> have

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
third in that group obviously you'd have

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.730 
third in that group obviously you'd have
to<00:04:45.070> say<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.340> brazil<00:04:45.610> will<00:04:45.790> win<00:04:45.820> group<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.450> the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
to say that brazil will win group a the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.050 
to say that brazil will win group a the
second<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.220> group<00:04:48.400> would<00:04:48.520> probably<00:04:48.940> be

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
second in that group would probably be

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.430 
second in that group would probably be
croatia<00:04:49.450> they're<00:04:49.660> probably<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.110> strongest

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
croatia they're probably the strongest

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.860 
croatia they're probably the strongest
of<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.310> other<00:04:51.460> three<00:04:51.760> sides<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:52.360> personally

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
of the other three sides and personally

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.750 
of the other three sides and personally
I<00:04:52.930> think<00:04:52.960> Cameroon<00:04:53.530> can<00:04:53.710> see<00:04:53.890> off<00:04:54.040> Mexico<00:04:54.550> and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
I think Cameroon can see off Mexico and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.280 
I think Cameroon can see off Mexico and
finish<00:04:55.330> third<00:04:55.510> in<00:04:55.630> that<00:04:55.690> group<00:04:55.930> although<00:04:56.080> of

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
finish third in that group although of

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.810 
finish third in that group although of
course<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:56.680> won't<00:04:56.830> be<00:04:57.040> enough<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.550> see<00:04:57.670> them

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
course that won't be enough to see them

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.970 
course that won't be enough to see them
progress<00:04:57.910> through<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.350> next<00:04:59.500> round<00:04:59.680> of

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
progress through to the next round of

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.290 
progress through to the next round of
the<00:05:00.100> world<00:05:00.280> cuts<00:05:00.520> unfortunately<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.180> don't
