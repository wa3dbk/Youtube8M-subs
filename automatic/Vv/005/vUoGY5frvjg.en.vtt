00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.600
 precedent and give 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.630
 given to figueirense and ceará 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.100
 after a week with 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.530
 controversial, the alvinegro needed to demonstrate in the field that the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.530
 difficulties of substitution had been 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.029
 The week was very good. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.029
 we had some players also felt the goal of the game until today 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 bush made party in the locker room more 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.819
 the best training 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.949
 because we thought that your part of this good balanced 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 first as a measure we hope that in the role of j 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 with the ball rolling the ceará 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.770
 it started better on the field thiago humberto scared 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.790
 in the 16th minute thiago humberto returned to threaten the goal of Santa Catarina 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.860
 three minutes later one more chance and lost but were of two others 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 players the most dangerous bids 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.780
 After 23 minutes, following a well-crafted free kick by nilson 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 miraculous form 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.790
 another spectacular defense 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.400
 showing mine 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.080
 another goalkeeper from figueirense 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.770
 and it was the Santa Catarina who managed to score 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.930
 first at 43 minutes on contract 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 in one received free 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 candy and pasta for fernando henrique 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.110
 the time spent on the first stage discounts crossed in the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.120
 and we like 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 went up to swing the fig tree nets 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.790
 with two to ten years by no means 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.480
 If that happen 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.560
 the 3% 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 with a goal at the end of the game 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.010
 but has had other opportunities 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.500
 but did not get his sixth goal in the league sagres managed 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.390
 37 of the first half 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.540
 on the second half back there 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.860
 to make the turn and got the victory and in the second half the ceará looked for more 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 the goal just six minutes into the assault 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 vitinho filipe azevedo and kicks strong and more capable 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.179
 at 19 maicon was expelled 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.609
 at 25 another explosion in the figueirense bruno vieira took the second 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.859
 she then told Lula 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.229
 with two players 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.659
 arad could not take 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.169
 and live the goal of 1 thousand 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.169
 at the end of the game 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.169
 the asphalt also threatened to start 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.989
 it ended in 1 to 1 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.039
 pacheco collapsed 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.259
 we also had some opportunities 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:44.969
 that we could have made the goal come out with the win 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.579
 their team close very well as we close and mine 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.629
 The big difference is that I saw in the game that our team provoked some 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.679
 changes 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.569
 in this rhythm of game stay but I'm right 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.639
 it is possible for the move to leave the mark to create some opportunities 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.649
 we still managed to create some 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.649
 we had the competence to score the goal that would give us the victory 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.689
 I hope to continue after the game analyzed the match as joel queirós 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.169
 have talked about the tie with your turn 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.779
 during the 90 minutes there was little 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.129
 our team with the team with a 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.989
 in the season and with 50% of embezzlement it is difficult some players like bald 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.939
 coming back from surgery 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.419
 we had some problems like thomé adolescent who did not train 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.599
 since Thursday 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.959
 and if we analyze this figueirense team the team that played our 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.059
 physically even by the lack of a correct difference of 30 to 35% 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.789
 that our team was brave 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.849
 is what we did right if the stocking really factor home 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.599
 first time could have turned 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.589
 the metro is with the score of 3 to 1 plans or something similar the second time 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.549
 we also had the best chances 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.849
 let's not be when you do not do you run risk how was the goal of 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.040
 letter at 40min for a few seconds the little record of the first time 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.289
 this time what was lacking until a little more peace of mind than when 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.399
 we had the numerical advantage of two players 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.779
 we could work a little the Argentine ball began to insist 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.629
 we played the ball in the area but even then we had the best chances one with 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.030
 other percentage of the rally in the other 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:28.360
 a tragedy of conscious concierge 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.780
 unfortunately missed goal italian walked only missed the goal you do not have what 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.180
 explaining this tactically was very good 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.590
 is players handed the goalkeeper doni congratulations even with the tie of the leader 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.510
 it hurts us to overcome the 3 points unfortunately did not come what we have to 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.370
 do 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.719
 It is from tomorrow, we will join you in the journey. 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.449
