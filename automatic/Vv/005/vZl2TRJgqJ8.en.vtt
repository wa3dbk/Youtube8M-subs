our best and try and bolster our attack
as<00:03:17.340> well<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:17.639> that's<00:03:17.790> where<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.000> seem<00:03:18.269> to

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
as well because that's where I seem to

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.180 
as well because that's where I seem to
be<00:03:18.449> struggling<00:03:18.780> we're<00:03:19.319> also<00:03:19.530> playing<00:03:19.949> a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
be struggling we're also playing a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.680 
be struggling we're also playing a
rematch<00:03:20.519> against<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.060> guy<00:03:21.180> who<00:03:21.239> played<00:03:21.479> last

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
rematch against the guy who played last

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.509 
rematch against the guy who played last
time<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.470> because<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.340> which

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
time just because of the which

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.550 
time just because of the which
was<00:03:23.699> what<00:03:23.879> was<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> game<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.049> hopefully

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
was what was in the game and hopefully

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.319 
was what was in the game and hopefully
it'll<00:03:25.949> be<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> bit<00:03:26.310> better<00:03:26.489> game<00:03:26.819> than<00:03:27.060> before

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
it'll be a bit better game than before

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.360 
it'll be a bit better game than before
so<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.659> can<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:27.900> his<00:03:27.989> team<00:03:28.199> once<00:03:28.470> again<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.010> is

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so you can see his team once again it is

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.119 
so you can see his team once again it is
a<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> nice<00:03:30.389> ppl<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.169> Sevilla<00:03:31.590> high<00:03:31.889> but

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
a it's a nice ppl and Sevilla high but

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.229 
a it's a nice ppl and Sevilla high but
even<00:03:32.340> though<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.519> not<00:03:32.639> full<00:03:32.849> chemistry

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
even though it's not full chemistry

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.699 
even though it's not full chemistry
because<00:03:33.359> of<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.720> weak<00:03:33.900> links<00:03:34.199> in<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> defense

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
because of the weak links in the defense

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.250 
because of the weak links in the defense
but<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> not<00:03:36.000> bad<00:03:36.239> team<00:03:36.540> anyway<00:03:37.109> we'll
