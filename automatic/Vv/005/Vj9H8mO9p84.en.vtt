00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 bari 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.209
 and here we are guys back on the canal 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.260
 youtube followed the welcome review 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.930
 request on your part 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 that of the n 416 because in reality 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.540
 I wanted to review another plus the jump 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.310
 but loud all audio do mole teatret e 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.020
 therefore, however, as new absolutes 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.330
 for I don't show how it works 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.910
 always 416 then I tell you about the m 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.580
 416 so I want to say to me it changes little 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.310
 one is the other then n 416 to a 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.200
 excellent assault pillow I come from Venus 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.730
 among the top three, four best bars 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.350
 assault rifles 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.280
 maybe I think it's a hair under the ska 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.750
 racale g20 385 but certainly a weapon 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.269
 really good with which you can find them 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.780
 well let's go straight to the statistics 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.970
 then 750 rpm ha a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.860
 a good value among the trivial we say 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.440
 700 I defined it like this the other time 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.480
 that of k 5 c is a high spotlight 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.540
 which may be 800 however others the only one 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.640
 assault rifle that at 753 pm then a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 a bit a bit particular from this point 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.350
 of view they give maximum minimum damage 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.570
 standard from caliber 556 born therefore 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.420
 we have 25 of short range damage of 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.360
 pebbles give a minimum of 55 meters because 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.700
 It has an assault rifle charger 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.940
 standard 30 rounds if you agree 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.440
 as I would say that my 416 is the weapon 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.900
 that at the best ratio we say 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.579
 effectiveness and ease of use because 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.470
 however it is a weapon that has a very good one 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.709
 ferret that allows you to do a good job 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.410
 strech 2 strike three strike 4 also though 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.049
 It is easy to use both a gift a 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.400
 slightly unbalanced to the right recoils a little 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.549
 more respect than to the left 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.750
 however it is also a kg of the first shot 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.299
 discreet and quite high 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 however as a whole it is a ductile weapon 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.920
 and easy to use a lot more second 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.750
 me compared to 23 it is difficult 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.880
 let the gusts take a little panic 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.880
 to ska racca and still beats 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.530
 quite high vertically or 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.440
 however of 85 which is very inaccurate 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.960
 when you shoot then in the end we say 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.610
 that is my 416 in between 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.520
 better weapons than the assault precisely for 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.260
 I'll mention just those events 385 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.090
 maybe a little easier to use e 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.240
 more to bring everyone as it comes 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.419
 put yourself z80 5 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.639
 3 and it is not a case that n 416 a il 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.139
 ferretti that settles exactly between 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:51.080
 the 800 rpm my true 85 and 700 euros e 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.360
 pm of the audi a3 and of the cz is not a case 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.220
 because if you go there to review the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.870
 video I had made to you on the rules 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.340
 I had explained that you adjust to something that 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.259
 increases every time a comes out 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.569
 new shot from the charger ie from 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.520
 excuse your gun then you will 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.199
 high means that the shots come out with 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.880
 a higher speed means that the 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.220
 recall then increased a speed 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.770
 greater then I am in the end 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.440
 explaining that it will appear to say coil 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.659
 what matters to determine if 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.889
 that weapon is easy to manage or not 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.330
 the rake loadout file then what there 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.310
 we assemble on this weapon as the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.289
 use well i tried it a little bit 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.330
 all the sauces though eventually opted for 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.669
 the angled and I also explain why 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.110
 as it is not a weapon complicated by 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.759
 manage you could put yourself 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.680
 quietly even the ergonomic or the 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.750
 torch you know the cup improves the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.210
 precision of the weapon in a general sense 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.919
 instead of the living economy it improves the 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.990
 precision in the weapon when you shoot 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.199
 in movement whether you are in hi fi reco 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.690
 in abs you could use these two 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.460
 attachment however there is a problem there is a 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.759
 problem that this weapon here at a recall 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.099
 a little unbalanced on the horizontal axis 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.080
 and this thing feels very much when 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.930
 prices have been made when you are canceled 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.810
 has virtually the same effect as 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:09.020
 m 16 to 3 is really at 4 sorry 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.270
 slip from the battlefield 3 is 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.030
 really annoying this thing because 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.500
 the weapon will begin to drift 9 derive 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.660
 to the right 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.670
 you can't do anything you should stop 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.450
 to shoot if you use the angled 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.700
 this effect is noticeable 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.110
 let's say reduced tarnished then the year 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.000
 side in my opinion the best solution 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.190
 also because it has a kick of the first blow 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.430
 this weapon of 2.2 which is not really 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.430
 bass 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.030
 even today it's all tomorrow should 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.250
 exit the fourth episode of the series 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.379
 flying four rooms I'll talk a little about 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.310
 domination check of some advice 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:27.599
 helpful 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.759
 we say to do better in this 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.039
 mode is nothing so keep on 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:32.699
 follow us maybe put a like you not 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:34.800
 costs too much 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:37.550
 sign up and nothing we get at 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.550
 next hello
