00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.269
 our solar system is made up of eight planets and a star that is 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.710
 Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.130
 Saturn Uranus 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.509
 and neptune 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.400
 imaz star kessel sun 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 we are going to present you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.429
 the planet 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.289
 Neptune 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.410
 all the information that we came out on this planet the country hala 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.730
 madrid i'm going to see 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.660
 for her our mission all the information 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.480
 say that place to earth 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.020
 in the image 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.260
 the satellite I will read through which the images send us 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 of neptune 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.630
 the flight will alert all twelve years to reach the planet Neptune 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 its signals took four hours to reach the earth 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.870
 this is the image of Neptune that had been obtained with the best 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 ground telescopes 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.530
 Here you can see the first images close by and focus on those taken in 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 the vessel 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.600
 1 is almost twin won 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.620
 but much easier to observe 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.890
 a wait that it be with a small solid core 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.610
 its magnetic field has an inclination of 47 degrees with respect to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.260
 axis of rotation 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.260
 the planet composes a rotation in 16 hours 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.580
 compared to the Neptune lands is a giant 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.580
 but it's slightly smaller than a no 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.180
 the white spots are circuses is not that they are at high altitude 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.350
 Neptune's internal heat generates more energy 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 the planet receives from the sun 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.930
 from it derives to a variable weather and great hurricanes like the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.260
 called the eye of the magician 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.669
 and upon which the magician the great dark spot 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.669
 1 can ahead like the earth 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.079
 an atom of the stain 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.759
 the tele camera has it in the center actually the spot rotates around the 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.639
 planet 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.819
 with a plot of 10 hectares 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.449
 is pushed to the west by continuous winds very puestÃ­simos 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 that his plan at one thousand 200 kilometers per hour 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:38.499
 before the explosion of the goya that was considered that neptune only had 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.849
 partial rings practically arcs 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.180
 actually Neptune has a complete ring system 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 It has two main rings and one more 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.209
 inside 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.650
 mosquera is formed by hydrogen eliot and a little methane 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.599
 the methane sucks the red cross and that's why the planet looks blue 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.219
 this structure 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.449
 of the planet neptune as we see how blue is the atmosphere 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.449
 the green is the mantle 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:13.889
 the nucleus 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.869
 yellow part its center 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:17.969
 the planet 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.469
 of its 100% 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.019
 hydrogen is 85% 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.359
 the mess I'm sad percent I'm afraid is 2% 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:26.910
 the layers 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.909
 the atmosphere its thickness is not defined 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.810
 its composed of hydrogen helium mecano in gaseous state 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.019
 the bark 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.239
 it is 10 thousand 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.239
 at 15 thousand kilometers broken down 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.329
 and is made up of the icy guide 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.969
 i 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.739
 ammonia and methane 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.689
 and the core 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.249
 its thickness 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:53.199
 six thousand kilometers 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.199
 and is made up of rock 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.179
