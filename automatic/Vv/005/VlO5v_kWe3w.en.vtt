 several generations to correct there 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.149
 subject would be this good is the difference 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.890
 clear the difference between postage and possession 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.590
 illegal firearms 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.050
 You know that sometimes in the contest 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.450
 difficulty in differentiating what is postage 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.310

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.310
 Porsche is when you have a contact

 with the object in the case a weapon of 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.510

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 importance is 70 after she does not have 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.610
 direct contact with her is saving 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.820
 him under his social surveillance 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.220

 conditional suspension of the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.260
