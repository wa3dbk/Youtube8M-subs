00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
making this cross right here and it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.759 
making this cross right here and it
helps<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> pre<00:00:30.750> folding<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> don't

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
helps with the pre folding so you don't

like you see this first line cross right

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
like you see this first line cross right
here<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> line<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.180> at

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
here make it a line with that but not at

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
here make it a line with that but not at
the<00:00:51.600> tip<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.649> point<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.309> maybe<00:00:53.940> three

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the tip at this point like maybe three

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.910 
the tip at this point like maybe three
fourths<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> fold<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:58.309> hold<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.600> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
fourths of it so fold that hold that and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.759 
fourths of it so fold that hold that and
then<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.699> simply<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> regular<00:01:04.290> paper

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
then just simply do a regular paper

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.380 
then just simply do a regular paper
airplane<00:01:05.780> fold<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:10.670> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> speeder

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
airplane fold and if you want a speeder

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
airplane fold and if you want a speeder
go<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.020> other<00:01:13.170> video<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.860> i<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.189> for

and everything so and then there's a big
triangle<00:02:39.360> shaped<00:02:39.690> thing<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.170> looks<00:02:40.349> like

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
triangle shaped thing that looks like

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.470 
triangle shaped thing that looks like
your<00:02:40.680> original<00:02:41.190> paper<00:02:41.400> plant<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:42.299> like

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
your original paper plant it look like

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.069 
your original paper plant it look like
pretty<00:02:42.720> much<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.290> but<00:02:44.250> smaller<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.900> pretty

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
pretty much this but smaller just pretty

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.710 
pretty much this but smaller just pretty
much<00:02:46.170> shrunk<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.549> if<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.450> to

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
much shrunk it and then if you want to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
much shrunk it and then if you want to
like<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.349> pretty<00:02:49.620> good<00:02:49.799> glider<00:02:50.099> it'll

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
like this is a pretty good glider it'll

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.069 
like this is a pretty good glider it'll
glide<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.120> everything<00:02:51.569> like<00:02:52.109> glue<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:54.209> one

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
glide in everything like glue but one

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.050 
glide in everything like glue but one
thing<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.560> might<00:02:55.709> also<00:02:55.980> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.700> fold

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
thing you might also want to do is fold

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.479 
thing you might also want to do is fold
it<00:02:57.239> back<00:02:57.420> where<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.319> then<00:02:59.010> take<00:02:59.250> this

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
it back where it was and then take this

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.660 
it back where it was and then take this
and<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.200> see<00:03:01.410> where<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.769> we<00:03:01.890> made<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.400> line

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and you see where that we made that line

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.030 
and you see where that we made that line
and<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.480> even<00:03:03.870> wear<00:03:04.049> this<00:03:04.200> bottom<00:03:04.680> part<00:03:04.859> is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
and and even wear this bottom part is

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.789 
and and even wear this bottom part is
put<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.940> over<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.690> then<00:03:06.810> feel<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.379> then

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
put this over it and then feel it then

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.509 
put this over it and then feel it then
put<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.879> fold<00:03:09.450> asst<00:03:09.660> upwards<00:03:10.319> on<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
put the fold asst upwards on to that

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.839 
put the fold asst upwards on to that
line<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:15.299> reason<00:03:15.510> I<00:03:15.569> say<00:03:15.599> of<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.410> line

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
line and the reason I say of that line

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.490 
line and the reason I say of that line
pacifically<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.180> because<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.230> make<00:03:19.380> it

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
pacifically is because you can make it

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:29.360 
pacifically is because you can make it
even<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:21.079> both<00:03:22.079> sides<00:03:27.980> okay<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.340> just

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
even on both sides okay and then just

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.650 
even on both sides okay and then just
kind<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.510> flap<00:03:30.810> them<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:32.099> you<00:03:32.639> sold<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.419> it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
kind of flap them if you sold it it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.509 
kind of flap them if you sold it it
should<00:03:33.840> look<00:03:34.019> kind<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.099> then

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
should look kind of like that and then

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.580 
should look kind of like that and then
you<00:03:35.609> open<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:40.139> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you open it have like this so this is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.809 
you open it have like this so this is
really<00:03:40.769> good<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.160> make<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.700> little
