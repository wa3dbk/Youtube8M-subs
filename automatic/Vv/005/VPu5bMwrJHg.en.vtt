00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220 

I<00:00:00.060> want<00:00:00.299> to<00:00:00.329> show<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.570> a<00:00:00.630> couple<00:00:00.780> of<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.079> new

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
I want to show you a couple of the new

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.540 
I want to show you a couple of the new
features<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.709> I've<00:00:01.829> added<00:00:01.979> for<00:00:02.280> version

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
features that I've added for version

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.999 
features that I've added for version
1.04<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.720> biped<00:00:04.049> editor<00:00:04.380> so<00:00:04.710> i<00:00:04.740> have<00:00:04.859> this

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
1.04 of the biped editor so i have this

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.710 
1.04 of the biped editor so i have this
character<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:05.819> here<00:00:06.000> from<00:00:06.210> my<00:00:06.359> own<00:00:06.509> like

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
character in here from my own like

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.509 
character in here from my own like
normal<00:00:07.080> i<00:00:07.140> can<00:00:07.290> add<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> biped<00:00:07.950> component

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
normal i can add the biped component

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.000 
normal i can add the biped component
because<00:00:09.389> he's<00:00:09.540> using<00:00:09.929> Maya's<00:00:10.679> naming

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
because he's using Maya's naming

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.230 
because he's using Maya's naming
convention<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.490> can<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:11.820> automatically

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
convention that can just automatically

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.999 
convention that can just automatically
set<00:00:12.509> them<00:00:12.630> up<00:00:12.719> using<00:00:12.929> my<00:00:13.200> own<00:00:13.349> names<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.889> it's

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
set them up using my own names and it's

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.250 
set them up using my own names and it's
detected<00:00:14.460> all<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> parts<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.059> normal<00:00:15.389> so

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
detected all the parts like normal so

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.599 
detected all the parts like normal so
the<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:16.650> thing<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.830> I've<00:00:16.980> added<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.460> is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the first thing that I've added here is

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.400 
the first thing that I've added here is
the<00:00:17.730> ability<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.060> add<00:00:18.090> colliders<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.779> start<00:00:19.050> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the ability to add colliders on start so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.429 
the ability to add colliders on start so
before<00:00:19.560> when<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.310> start<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> game<00:00:20.970> it

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
before when you start the game it

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.750 
before when you start the game it
wouldn't<00:00:22.439> actually<00:00:22.590> add<00:00:22.949> any<00:00:23.189> colliders<00:00:23.640> to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
wouldn't actually add any colliders to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
wouldn't actually add any colliders to
this<00:00:23.910> character<00:00:24.300> until<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.230> them<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this character until you put them in a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.689 
this character until you put them in a
rag<00:00:25.650> doll<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.119> then<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.689> remove<00:00:28.019> rag<00:00:28.289> doll

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
rag doll and then if you remove rag doll

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.139 
rag doll and then if you remove rag doll
the<00:00:29.699> colliders<00:00:30.060> would<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.269> gone<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.430> if<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the colliders would be gone so if you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.940 
the colliders would be gone so if you
for<00:00:33.600> instance<00:00:33.630> need<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.410> able<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.739> hit

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
for instance need to be able to do hit

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.880 
for instance need to be able to do hit
detection<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.489> individual<00:00:35.969> body<00:00:36.149> parts<00:00:36.890> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
detection on individual body parts you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
detection on individual body parts you
can<00:00:38.070> turn<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> add<00:00:38.879> colliders<00:00:39.770> when<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
can turn this to add colliders when the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.930 
can turn this to add colliders when the
game<00:00:41.100> starts<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.980> now<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> kinematic

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
game starts and now you have a kinematic

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.459 
game starts and now you have a kinematic
rigid<00:00:45.239> body<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> Collider<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.230> edge<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
rigid body with a Collider on edge of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.170 
rigid body with a Collider on edge of
these<00:00:46.590> body<00:00:46.800> parts<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> create<00:00:47.730> rag<00:00:47.910> doll

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
these body parts if you create rag doll

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
these body parts if you create rag doll
the<00:00:48.840> colliders<00:00:49.260> will<00:00:49.379> stay<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the colliders will stay there and if you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.000 
the colliders will stay there and if you
remove<00:00:50.550> rag<00:00:50.760> doll<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.379> clatters<00:00:52.379> day<00:00:52.530> too<00:00:52.590> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
remove rag doll a clatters day too so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
remove rag doll a clatters day too so
that<00:00:53.129> we'd<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.430> able<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.579> walk<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.210> his<00:00:54.600> body

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
that we'd be able to walk over his body

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.270 
that we'd be able to walk over his body
using<00:00:55.320> physics<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.070> whatever<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> do

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
using physics or whatever you want to do

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
using physics or whatever you want to do
so<00:00:59.280> another<00:01:00.270> feature<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.840> added<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so another feature that I added here is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
so another feature that I added here is
the<00:01:01.590> ability<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.160> edit<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.180> angular

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the ability to edit the angular

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.690 
the ability to edit the angular
distribution<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:05.040> joint<00:01:05.250> chains<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
distribution for some joint chains to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.960 
distribution for some joint chains to
the<00:01:05.790> neck<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> spine<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> normally<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the neck and spine so normally it just

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510 
the neck and spine so normally it just
does<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.540> linear<00:01:10.320> fall<00:01:10.560> off<00:01:10.799> based<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
does a linear fall off based on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
does a linear fall off based on the
length<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> spine<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
length of the spine and kind of the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.200 
length of the spine and kind of the
homogenous<00:01:13.799> parameter<00:01:14.280> value<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> link

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
homogenous parameter value of the link

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.410 
homogenous parameter value of the link
down<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> length<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.100> spine<00:01:17.420> that's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
down the length of the spine that's

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.320 
down the length of the spine that's
enough<00:01:18.720> thing<00:01:18.900> since<00:01:19.140> unlike<00:01:19.320> link<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.979> length

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
enough thing since unlike link or length

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.730 
enough thing since unlike link or length
but<00:01:21.330> basically<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.470> say<00:01:22.680> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
but basically now you can say for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.539 
but basically now you can say for
instance<00:01:23.100> maybe<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.880> want<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> maximum<00:01:25.070> x<00:01:26.070> value

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
instance maybe I want a maximum x value

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
instance maybe I want a maximum x value
of<00:01:26.759> 200<00:01:27.450> degrees<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.189> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of 200 degrees and I can have that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
of 200 degrees and I can have that
applied<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.000> both<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.420> or<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.009> want<00:01:32.009> some

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
applied to both of these or I want some

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.499 
applied to both of these or I want some
kind<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> different<00:01:32.790> fall<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> you'll

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
kind of different fall off and you'll

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
kind of different fall off and you'll
get<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.689> separate<00:01:34.590> key<00:01:34.740> frame<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.430> each

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
get a separate key frame here for each

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.010 
get a separate key frame here for each
parameter<00:01:35.850> value<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> length<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
parameter value on the length of the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
parameter value on the length of the
spine<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> maybe<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.150> want<00:01:39.360> something<00:01:39.659> more

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
spine so maybe I want something more

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.789 
spine so maybe I want something more
like<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.570> apply<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.740> can

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like this and that I can apply you can

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
like this and that I can apply you can
also<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.250> back<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> normal<00:01:44.939> by<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.299> switching

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
also go back to normal by just switching

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
also go back to normal by just switching
this<00:01:46.020> cylinder<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.159> automatically

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
this cylinder and it will automatically

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.420 
this cylinder and it will automatically
keep<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> keyframe<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.659> each<00:01:49.189> link<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
keep it keyframe for each link in the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.420 
keep it keyframe for each link in the
joint<00:01:50.700> chain<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.950> finally<00:01:55.950> another<00:01:56.100> feature

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
joint chain and finally another feature

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
joint chain and finally another feature
that<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.700> added<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.719> people<00:01:57.869> have

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that I added that a lot of people have

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.770 
that I added that a lot of people have
requested<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> ability<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
requested from me is the ability to get

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
requested from me is the ability to get
up<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.170> rag<00:02:01.439> doll<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.549> before<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> went

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
up from rag doll so before if you went

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.530 
up from rag doll so before if you went
into<00:02:03.840> rag<00:02:04.110> doll<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.040> plain<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
into rag doll it's just plain want to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
into rag doll it's just plain want to
show<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
show you here you can see that the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
show you here you can see that the
characters<00:02:08.910> route<00:02:09.090> stays<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.539> place<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.560> we

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
characters route stays in place so if we

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
characters route stays in place so if we
just<00:02:10.860> try<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> place<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> get<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.360> animation

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
just try to place and get up animation

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.480 
just try to place and get up animation
the<00:02:12.989> character

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
the character

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.460 
the character
sike<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.820> can<00:02:13.970> snap<00:02:14.330> over<00:02:14.600> after<00:02:15.350> we've

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
sike you can snap over after we've

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.820 
sike you can snap over after we've
destroyed<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.040> rag<00:02:16.220> doll<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.960> what<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.680> can

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
destroyed the rag doll so what you can

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.370 
destroyed the rag doll so what you can
do<00:02:18.980> now<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.250> add<00:02:19.730> some<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.420> up<00:02:20.510> animations<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
do now is add some get up animations and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.540 
do now is add some get up animations and
just<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.800> quickly<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.400> show

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
just really quickly I'm going to show

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.890 
just really quickly I'm going to show
you<00:02:22.610> one<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:22.970> what<00:02:23.210> some<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.420> these<00:02:23.600> look<00:02:23.870> like

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
you one of what some of these look like

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.900 
you one of what some of these look like
so<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.140> is<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.320> animation<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:28.580> up<00:02:28.700> from

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so this is a animation to get up from

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.120 
so this is a animation to get up from
prone<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:30.320> you<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.770> when<00:02:31.040> it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
prone and you can see that when it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.860 
prone and you can see that when it
starts<00:02:31.250> out<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.790> roof<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.180> basically<00:02:32.600> under

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
starts out the roof is basically under

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.930 
starts out the roof is basically under
his<00:02:33.020> pelvis<00:02:33.440> here<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:34.190> just<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.700> stop

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
his pelvis here I'm just going to stop

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.980 
his pelvis here I'm just going to stop
and<00:02:35.180> start<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.540> again<00:02:35.660> since<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.350> clearly

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
and start that again since you clearly

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.720 
and start that again since you clearly
where<00:02:38.990> has<00:02:39.200> my<00:02:39.730> supine<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.630> animations

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
where has my supine get up animations

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.000 
where has my supine get up animations
the<00:02:43.730> root<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.090> kind<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.390> more<00:02:44.570> at<00:02:44.690> his<00:02:44.810> feet<00:02:45.050> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
the root is kind of more at his feet you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.230 
the root is kind of more at his feet you
can<00:02:46.160> see<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.430> here<00:02:46.610> kind<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.880> between<00:02:47.060> this

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
can see it's here kind of between this

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.540 
can see it's here kind of between this
week<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.620> he'll<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:48.770> up<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.130> then<00:02:49.250> kind<00:02:49.400> of

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
week and he'll get up and then kind of

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.400 
week and he'll get up and then kind of
stand<00:02:49.790> over<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.300> location<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.320> would

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
stand over this location and this would

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.610 
stand over this location and this would
be<00:02:51.500> where<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.740> resume<00:02:52.130> my<00:02:52.160> idol<00:02:52.580> from<00:02:53.620> so

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
be where I resume my idol from so

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.510 
be where I resume my idol from so
basically<00:02:55.040> what<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.550> do<00:02:55.760> now<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:58.370> get

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
basically what you can do now just get

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.990 
basically what you can do now just get
rid<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.760> these<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:01.160> even<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.610> don't<00:03:01.910> have

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
rid of these and even if you don't have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.270 
rid of these and even if you don't have
these<00:03:02.270> added<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.810> biped<00:03:03.170> component<00:03:04.040> will<00:03:04.130> add

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
these added the biped component will add

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.710 
these added the biped component will add
these<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.640> your<00:03:04.700> character<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.330> can<00:03:05.540> add

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
these to your character but you can add

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.320 
these to your character but you can add
some<00:03:05.960> get<00:03:06.200> up<00:03:06.290> animations<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.120> order<00:03:08.210> for

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
some get up animations so in order for

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.550 
some get up animations so in order for
this<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.600> work<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:09.530> least

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
this to work you have to have at least

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.690 
this to work you have to have at least
one<00:03:09.830> prone<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.580> one<00:03:10.760> supine<00:03:11.420> animation<00:03:12.700> will

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
one prone and one supine animation will

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
one prone and one supine animation will
just<00:03:13.850> add<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:15.970> this<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:18.740> can<00:03:18.770> also

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
just add this and this and you can also

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.340 
just add this and this and you can also
specify<00:03:19.400> an<00:03:19.880> energy<00:03:20.270> value<00:03:20.600> associated<00:03:20.900> with

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
specify an energy value associated with

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.200 
specify an energy value associated with
each<00:03:21.530> one<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.370> for<00:03:22.610> example<00:03:22.640> when<00:03:23.120> you

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
each one so that for example when you

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.790 
each one so that for example when you
call<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.600> function<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.170> your<00:03:24.260> other<00:03:24.410> scripts

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
call this function in your other scripts

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.710 
call this function in your other scripts
if<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.520> had<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> health<00:03:26.060> value<00:03:26.270> for<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
if you had a health value for the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.690 
if you had a health value for the
character<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:27.290> could<00:03:27.470> intelligently<00:03:28.220> select

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
character you could intelligently select

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.330 
character you could intelligently select
different<00:03:28.970> get<00:03:29.360> up<00:03:29.390> animations<00:03:30.050> based<00:03:30.980> on<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
different get up animations based on the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.180 
different get up animations based on the
energy<00:03:31.490> level<00:03:31.940> associated<00:03:32.210> with<00:03:32.690> them<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:34.100> you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
energy level associated with them so you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.460 
energy level associated with them so you
can<00:03:34.460> also<00:03:34.670> specify<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.690> at<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> root<00:03:36.170> start

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
can also specify here at the root start

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.400 
can also specify here at the root start
location<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:37.940> recall<00:03:38.210> from<00:03:38.540> prone<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
location so if you recall from prone the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.870 
location so if you recall from prone the
route<00:03:39.620> was<00:03:39.740> kind<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.010> under<00:03:40.160> his<00:03:40.310> pelvis<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
route was kind of under his pelvis and

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.000 
route was kind of under his pelvis and
when<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.060> gets<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.360> from<00:03:41.570> soup<00:03:42.290> I'm<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.800> roots

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
when it gets up from soup I'm the roots

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.780 
when it gets up from soup I'm the roots
kind<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.400> between<00:03:43.580> his<00:03:43.790> feet<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:46.610> yeah

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
kind of between his feet and so yeah

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.690 
kind of between his feet and so yeah
then<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.210> can<00:03:47.360> also<00:03:47.800> specify<00:03:48.800> that<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.550> a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
then you can also specify that this is a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.820 
then you can also specify that this is a
prone<00:03:50.210> get<00:03:50.630> up<00:03:50.750> animation<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.470> now<00:03:51.590> we<00:03:51.650> have

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
prone get up animation so now we have

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.410 
prone get up animation so now we have
one<00:03:51.860> of<00:03:52.130> each<00:03:52.220> type<00:03:52.280> we<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.150> all<00:03:53.300> their

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
one of each type we have all their

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.340 
one of each type we have all their
property<00:03:53.810> set<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:55.220> now<00:03:55.750> if<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.900> turn<00:03:57.110> them<00:03:57.230> into

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
property set so now if I turn them into

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.260 
property set so now if I turn them into
a<00:03:57.440> rag<00:03:57.680> doll<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.130> get<00:03:58.490> a<00:03:58.550> button<00:03:58.790> here<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.030> test

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
a rag doll I get a button here to test

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.450 
a rag doll I get a button here to test
getting<00:03:59.570> up<00:03:59.750> and<00:03:59.990> you<00:04:00.470> can<00:04:00.620> again<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:01.340> call

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
getting up and you can again just call

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.510 
getting up and you can again just call
this<00:04:01.640> function<00:04:02.470> from<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.620> component<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:04.340> your

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
this function from the component in your

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.130 
this function from the component in your
other<00:04:04.640> scripts<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:05.240> now<00:04:05.390> if<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.600> click<00:04:06.020> on

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
other scripts but now if you click on

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.950 
other scripts but now if you click on
get<00:04:06.410> up<00:04:06.560> here<00:04:06.830> it<00:04:07.430> kind<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.390> moves<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> root

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
get up here it kind of it moves the root

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.080 
get up here it kind of it moves the root
and<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.500> interpolates<00:04:09.920> him<00:04:10.310> sort<00:04:11.030> of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
and then it interpolates him sort of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.460 
and then it interpolates him sort of
into<00:04:11.240> position<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.810> he<00:04:11.959> can<00:04:12.080> get<00:04:12.200> up<00:04:12.350> from

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
into position so that he can get up from

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.590 
into position so that he can get up from
right<00:04:12.709> there<00:04:12.920> now<00:04:13.760> if<00:04:13.820> i<00:04:13.970> create<00:04:14.209> ragdoll

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
right there now if i create ragdoll

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.830 
right there now if i create ragdoll
again<00:04:14.900> he<00:04:15.470> falls<00:04:15.740> on<00:04:15.860> his<00:04:15.920> face<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.640> this<00:04:17.630> time

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
again he falls on his face and this time

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.510 
again he falls on his face and this time
it<00:04:18.020> will<00:04:18.080> notice<00:04:18.380> select<00:04:18.709> to<00:04:18.980> get<00:04:19.130> up<00:04:19.250> from

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
it will notice select to get up from

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.830 
it will notice select to get up from
prone<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.820> these<00:04:22.940> values<00:04:23.300> are<00:04:23.330> all<00:04:23.479> tweakable

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
prone so these values are all tweakable

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.140 
prone so these values are all tweakable
when<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.169> call<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.380> functions<00:04:24.890> but<00:04:25.610> there's

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
when you call the functions but there's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.430 
when you call the functions but there's
no

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
no

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.200 
no
basic<00:04:26.740> functionality<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.400> here<00:04:27.670> hopefully

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
basic functionality in here hopefully

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.250 
basic functionality in here hopefully
that<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.290> can<00:04:29.440> use<00:04:29.740> this<00:04:29.890> pretty<00:04:30.190> easily
