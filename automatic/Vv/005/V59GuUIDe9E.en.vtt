 The lowest is tomorrow 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.470
 Tenno 's first one-man 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.490
 Hot wow 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.430
 I think I'm piccolo 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.280
 Perhaps 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.500
 I think that I will be overwhelmed if I enter 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.460
 It is already 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.540
 It is expected while backing up 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 Great politics 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.530
 Because we prepared 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.969

 Many things a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:11.350
 I think the habit that everyone thought they wanted to run away is always 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.350
 But still all together in this way 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:21.049
 Everyone told me Some had been doing this 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.140
 I think that it is thanks to who have supported doing this towards the words and the staff's are a lot of people 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.540
 From 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.220
