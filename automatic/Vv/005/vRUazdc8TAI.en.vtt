00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
first thing it always comes to mind when
I<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.430> pieces<00:01:41.670> color<00:01:42.479> because

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
I see all of your pieces color because

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
I see all of your pieces color because
I'm<00:01:43.140> someone<00:01:43.470> who's<00:01:43.590> attracted<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:44.130> lot<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
I'm someone who's attracted a lot to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.670 
I'm someone who's attracted a lot to
color<00:01:44.909> why<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.630> love<00:01:45.840> working<00:01:46.110> with<00:01:46.409> color

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
color why do you love working with color

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.399 
color why do you love working with color
so<00:01:46.799> much<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> captures<00:01:48.299> essences<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
so much I think it captures essences I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.260 
so much I think it captures essences I
mean<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.770> almost<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.759> mood<00:01:51.060> will

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
mean it's almost like your mood will

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.120 
mean it's almost like your mood will
change<00:01:51.630> depending<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> color<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
change depending on the color that you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.580 
change depending on the color that you
wear<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.180> color<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> Cho<00:01:55.140> choose

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
wear or your color that you Cho choose

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
wear or your color that you Cho choose
to<00:01:55.950> wear<00:01:56.100> reflects<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:57.000> mood<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
to wear reflects your mood and so I just

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.359 
to wear reflects your mood and so I just
think<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.710> fun<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> mess<00:01:59.250> around

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
think it's really fun to mess around

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740 
think it's really fun to mess around
with<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.579> lot<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> different<00:02:00.210> colors<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> put

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
with a lot of different colors and put

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
with a lot of different colors and put
colors<00:02:00.990> together<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.530> people<00:02:01.740> wouldn't<00:02:02.250> put

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
colors together that people wouldn't put

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.760 
colors together that people wouldn't put
together<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.719> safe<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
together because it's not safe I do that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.340 
together because it's not safe I do that
all<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.719> that's<00:02:06.719> another<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.290> point

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
all the time that's another good point

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.130 
all the time that's another good point
don't<00:02:07.979> always<00:02:08.129> be<00:02:08.429> safe<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.989> nice

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
don't always be safe you know it's nice

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.869 
don't always be safe you know it's nice
to<00:02:10.319> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.560> step<00:02:10.800> away<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.190> bit<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> if

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879

it's<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.459> an<00:02:30.550> interesting<00:02:31.000> texture<00:02:31.270> to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
it's really an interesting texture to

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.449 
it's really an interesting texture to
work<00:02:31.630> with<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.110> especially<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.709> jewelry

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
work with and especially in jewelry

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.610 
work with and especially in jewelry
because<00:02:33.790> normally<00:02:34.630> with<00:02:34.750> silk<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.530> of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
because normally with silk you think of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.220 
because normally with silk you think of
silk<00:02:35.860> as<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.310> wearable<00:02:36.880> clothing<00:02:37.360> right<00:02:37.930> but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
silk as just wearable clothing right but

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
silk as just wearable clothing right but
you<00:02:38.290> don't<00:02:38.470> think<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.800> adding<00:02:39.160> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you don't think of adding it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.040 
you don't think of adding it
incorporating<00:02:39.910> into<00:02:40.060> your<00:02:40.390> jewelry<00:02:40.660> pieces

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
incorporating into your jewelry pieces

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.440 
incorporating into your jewelry pieces
and<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> thought<00:02:41.950> let's<00:02:42.610> step<00:02:43.090> outside<00:02:43.239> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and so I thought let's step outside the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.180 
and so I thought let's step outside the
box<00:02:43.569> speaking<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.290> clothing<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.890> something
