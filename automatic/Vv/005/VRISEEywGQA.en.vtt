 hello to all and welcome to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.809

 damien thank you for being with us 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.180
 today we will come back first 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.840
 on the on the match happened this 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.759
 Last weekend 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 is that like tulle seen that 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.859
 happened to you it's a match 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.920
 with a good start to a good start 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.539
 team 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.910
 what we managed to score scored two 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.540
 tests fast enough so for you 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.700
 yes that's so much better 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.470
 it is especially to mark key points 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.880
 who scored me points quickly 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.580
 that's what happened unfortunately 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.340
 after that we had 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.490
 many approximations a lot 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.790
 of defensive mistakes and so that has 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.960
 allowed this Grenoble team to 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.810
 stay in the game until the end 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 and what did you think back to the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.760
 half time 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.250
 how it happened what 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.740
 you are told we already know that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.870
 to have a more hermetic defense less 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.860
 sell two balloons because ultimately 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.210
 on their attacks we will think 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.220
 endangered but on the cons 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.720
 attacks where they succeeded there precisely 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.570
 play forward and scored twice 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.430
 and as a first time captain 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.940
 entered first on the lawn at 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.740
 Recommended 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.650
 how did it go in your head and go 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.260
 it was a little bit special 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.110
 of emotion I am like to stay 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.550
 focused on sure 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 our matches and everyone the night of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.070
 its author it changed something 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.660
 yet your vision of the game but he has 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.540
 needed a little more lift the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.030
 head 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 a little more also communicate our 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.370
 invention 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.980
 on the felt 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.830
 on the vision me 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.210
 forbid that can its author and the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.320
 blow we will switch on one on the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 matches coming in front of us a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.760
 breeze coming the derby from the center 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.860
 they are first in the ranking after the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.140
 first day they planted four 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.110
 tests at la rochelle how do you see this 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.720
 match how you perceive value rambur 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.720
 because it's never easy to win 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.990
 in a flash comes out of a beautiful season and by 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.330
 he continues his momentum after this 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.930
 first match won at bonus points 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.569
 so 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.069
 we will be well prepared because we 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.330
 already focus first on us 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.290
 because I have a lot of gaps 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
 after that first match here against 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.500
 grenoble so I have to adjust a little the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.540
 defense and be a little more specific about 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.480
 on the launch when we have the ball 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.480
 to succeed justly scored to score 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.660
 more points especially 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.250
 then the match as soon as possible 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.490
 also the big black dot that we have 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.610
 surrounded it was the discipline was 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.410
 way too much and it's also a sector 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.840
 we had targeted we did not answer 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.550
 present so against brive and who more 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.170
 is outside he's going to have to this 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.650
 problem if we want to hope for some 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.510
 thing 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.120
 it's always nice to come back 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 and play on this terrain domenech mode 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.570
 saas and thanks a lot from elsewhere and good 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.670

 week before the reception of
