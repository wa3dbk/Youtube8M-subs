00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.779
 very good, I'm all parents of DNA 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:05.799
 gamer point is and we will make a new 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:07.990
 video in which everyone will be taught 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.320
 puzzles the first extensive and makes a 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.750
 dark and the second east of here jump 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.070
 from morgan the starting point is 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.529
 found on this website that is called 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.779
 spiral forgiveness puzzle that is found 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.050
 North of Morgan spiral in the area 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.699
 of levels 115 lime forest where 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.320
 this is then leaving the area of ​​the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.509
 grove in the city of whistles and 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.999
 well once we are here then we 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.030
 we direct here makes the spiral and here 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.640
 it is practically the waypoint to take you 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.620
 to a friend or two just in case 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.880
 it is very easy that here you fall several 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.500
 times 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.910
 how it happened to me because you have to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.440
 restart the puzzle because many times 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.390
 good die started going up by 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.590
 here when you get to this trunk 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.200
 you have to jump to the left 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.390
 because you stay in other cases is a 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.610
 rare and good thing this first part does not 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.320
 has greater difficulty than those blocks 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.660
 of said jump yes clear I was going up 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.610
 is going up and you jump a little 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.200
 bad you slip on a branch whatever 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.580
 for this one you fall and you die, it's worth it 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.770
 you have the jump to the left 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.720
 although it seems that the stones do not pass 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.040
 nothing this is important if you follow 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.600
 walking is that you have to take a leap 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.490
 accommodated now you have to jump towards 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 out to where that bird was 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.900
 has gone flying and now again 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.270
 we turn in here we continue 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.490
 advancing now santis out another 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 time in and here in the first 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 difficulties have to go as to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.290
 on top of this branch that does not seem very 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.360
 visible and you have to follow 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.770
 advancing and you have to climb this one 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.140
 mound and one of two or six by the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.970
 right like a lot of people do or 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.940
 you have here to the left so that 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.110
 everything straight that is much easier to climb 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.060
 See if it was for this other side 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.130
 well, you can also go up but 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.960
 well and now to do this 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 mound you have to climb this 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.640
 outgoing and from this outgoing to the other and 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.990
 so I do not know if you are seeing 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.119
 the parrot that is out there calling me 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.890
 telling me dad but good part 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.660
 of the direct now you have to continue 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270
 advancing and well this is the jump more 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.219
 long this part of the puzzle 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.229
 and from here on, well, this is already 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.429
 pretty easy jumps of stone in 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 stone has no greater difficulty 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.650
 and with that, you're already up 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.319
 the first part of this puzzle and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.480
 you get here is the chest that 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.280
 you get the achievement here and with that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.580
 you get the morgan jump good 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 from here this continues you have 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.620
 to keep moving forward with 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.080
 I do not know if you hear parrot but it's good 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.550
 happy happy car and here 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.600
 you will find those at the bar 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.670
 these guys and good for the kill 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.950
 They are easy to kill because they are low 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.440
 good level once the despachase 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.290
 we continue advancing and in this area 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.939
 you should have a little caution 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.489
 good may appear some more but 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.469
 you can pass of them said that you have 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.590
 to have a little caution in 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.819
 first place because they can appear 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.129
 the mortars like the one that has left me 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.580
 me that you can throw a projectile and 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.130
 guarantee you and second 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.530
 how happy is the other second 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.930
 be careful because it is from very high 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.170
 you can kill yourself and here is what I say 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.760
 that you go with a friend and yet 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.830
 good as this part this puzzle is 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.840
 much more difficult quite often than 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.050
 You will find groups of players like 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.080
 happens here almost always and well then you go 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.490
 resuscitating people and nothing happens 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.470
 well out there where they are jumping 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.400
 is where you have to go up there is what is 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.780
 this area here and here is where 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.940
 the puzzle begins 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.560
 and well this first part is pretty 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.810
 easy that is tall mushroom and it is what 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.600
 what happens that the camera here is a roll 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.360
 because there is a bit of vegetation going 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.250
 blocking the road is quite annoying and 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.150
 sometimes you have to expand other 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.150
 Sometimes you have to throw it back 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.210
 as you will see, there are some highs 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.430
 what 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.770
 look for example here in the jump not what 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.960
 you see is that there is so much vegetation that is 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.570
 here when you look with mushrooms 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.950
 you have to climb the branch and here you 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.900
 you find a branch that makes with a 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.550
 kind of rare spiral and you have to go 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.020
 to these quotes here and go up the 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.090
 next branch eye that here is a lot 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.120
 people fall then you have to follow 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.610
 going up these mushrooms and here when 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.440
 you get to the top 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.180
 you have to jump back to the branch 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.680
 Well this jump here you can 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 choke here you have to jump to the 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 right side of the branch that looks like 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.730
 you are going to fall and again to the mushrooms 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.370
 where is this mortar again here to 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.930
 the next branch to the next branch and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.830
 again to the mushrooms that here too 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.830
 there are people who tend to fall 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.550
 this I think that is the jump more 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.890
 difficult of the game is being tilted 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.840
 you have to jump as to the area of 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.580
 the left as I have done because if 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.390
 you can not slip and you can fall 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.370
 I believe that here 50% of the people 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.960
 planète falls that comes because you do not know 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.300
 how does it jump 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.070
 and it's pretty hard otherwise good 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.530
 You are jumping from that tan you are with 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.140
 careful not to fall is because it has 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.270
 past that being here that does is a 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.080
 I jump badly and you fall because you do not see with the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.970
 vegetation and good and practically 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.340
 when you arrive here you already say finally 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.639
 finished this puzzle and you get the 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.979
 chest and good, that's all 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.319
 and this time I have to say that I fell 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.539
 an interesting thing that yellow object 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.370
 I sold it for 25 silvers that for 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.349
 I do not know if you know but if you leave 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.759
 here the character will go to sleep and at 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.279
 next day you can go back to 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.080
 open the chest and well I hope that you 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.860
 like and see you the next video of 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.860
 tour from kiel arms
