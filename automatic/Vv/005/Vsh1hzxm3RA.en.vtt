00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
bit last night my friend was over and he

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.550 
bit last night my friend was over and he
wanted<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.299> try<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.509> left<00:01:48.780> 4<00:01:48.930> dead<00:01:49.049> 2<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.409> he

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
wanted to try out left 4 dead 2 so he

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
wanted to try out left 4 dead 2 so he
actually<00:01:49.920> tried<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> campaigns

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
actually tried out one of the campaigns

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually tried out one of the campaigns
I<00:01:51.240> hadn't<00:01:51.479> tried<00:01:51.630> yet<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.140> watched<00:01:52.590> him<00:01:52.799> play<00:01:52.829> at

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
I hadn't tried yet I watched him play at

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
I hadn't tried yet I watched him play at
single-player<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> can't<00:01:54.299> play

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
single-player because we can't play

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
single-player because we can't play
online<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.320> too<00:01:55.350> laggy

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
online because it was way too laggy

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
online because it was way too laggy
because<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.340> uploading<00:01:56.939> videos<00:01:57.240> constantly

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
because I'm uploading videos constantly

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.200 
because I'm uploading videos constantly
who<00:01:57.930> has<00:01:58.049> Sasson<00:01:58.439> scree<00:01:58.680> too<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> saw

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
who has Sasson scree too and so I saw

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.249 
who has Sasson scree too and so I saw
him<00:02:00.420> played<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> them<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.110> haven't

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
him played through one of them I haven't

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
him played through one of them I haven't
played<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> yet<00:02:01.829> what<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.399> noticed<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
played it yet what we noticed is that it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.999 
played it yet what we noticed is that it
seems<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.840> left<00:02:04.140> 4<00:02:04.170> dead<00:02:04.380> 2<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.680> way<00:02:04.979> easier

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
seems like left 4 dead 2 is way easier

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.280 
seems like left 4 dead 2 is way easier
when<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> play<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> by<00:02:06.210> yourself<00:02:06.659> offline

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
double team and triple teaming us so I

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.080 
double team and triple teaming us so I
would<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.769> guess<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.160> seems<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.670> is<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
would I guess it seems to be is that the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.180 
would I guess it seems to be is that the
more<00:02:35.269> human<00:02:35.690> people<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> team<00:02:36.739> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
more human people you have on a team the

more human people you have on a team the
AI<00:02:37.370> director<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.239> game<00:02:38.420> assumes<00:02:38.780> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
AI director in the game assumes that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.479 
AI director in the game assumes that
you're<00:02:39.110> really<00:02:39.319> good<00:02:39.680> or<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.099> know<00:02:40.370> it's

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
you're really good or you know it's

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.110 
you're really good or you know it's
better<00:02:40.670> than<00:02:40.790> having<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
better than having the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.570 
better than having the
computer-controlled<00:02:41.599> uh<00:02:41.980> teammate<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.459> they

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
computer-controlled uh teammate so they

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.800 
computer-controlled uh teammate so they
throw<00:02:43.880> more<00:02:44.090> at<00:02:44.360> you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
throw more at you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.600 
throw more at you
so<00:02:45.319> I<00:02:45.350> didn't<00:02:45.620> know<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.739> but<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.190> want<00:02:46.519> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
