00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.630
 the yellow klauser is a typical fly from 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.689
 sea but like so many artificial ones 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.340
 generous size and color 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.580
 gorgeous turns out to be excellent for the 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.860
 pike fishing there are many variations 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.020
 of this streamer and the model col 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.810
 bicolour face the enriched body of 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.580
 flash a baudo rato is probably among the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.779
 most effective for trying big 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.779
 freshwater predators 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.930
 we insert a fashion streamer of the 40 in the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.970
 clamp jaw we impose the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.309
 dominator loaded with a spool of 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.040
 assembly silk for large musche of 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.570
 chartreuse color and we fix the yarn 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.110
 to the front section of the axle 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.839
 of the hook we cut the excess head 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 of silk and we cover with the thread the 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.339
 anterior third of the hook stem for 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.540
 form a thin support on which 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.540
 lay down the eyes 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's take a couple of measurement leaders 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.030
 medium and colored red 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.580
 we lay there on the lower section of the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.740
 portion of loves covered by silk e 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.030
 let's stop them with crossed turns of the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.010
 building silk we continue to 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.260
 wrap the front mounting thread 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.900
 behind and around the small barbell 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.190
 red in order to lock it firmly 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.370
 we pass the last ones to the axis of the hook 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.960
 silk laps just before the buttonhole 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.570
 so take a bottle of glue 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.640
 specific cyan acrylic for fishing and 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.590
 we distribute a drop of the adhesive 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.710
 on the coils of silk that block the 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.810
 eyes we take a deer tail of 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.990
 yellow color and rather large 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.119
 large we select a consistent 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.250
 tuft of hair and cut it the most 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:15.340
 as close as possible to the skin from which 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:17.320
 stands this ingredient is known 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.280
 in the field of construction with the term 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.680
 of bach tail we hold tight with le 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.019
 fingers of one hand at the tip of the tuft e 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 we take the whole micro from its base 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.560
 fluff and hair of reduced length 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.660
 we introduce the bach tail bunch 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.400
 inside the sleeping tie e 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.950
 we repeatedly beat at the base 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.590
 of the accessory on the work table for 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:48.630
 align the tips of the hairs we remove the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.340
 tuft of bach tail from the sleeping draw 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.470
 we impose the scissors and cut a 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.840
 small section of the lower extremity 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.989
 hairs to make them aligned with them 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.989
 basis 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.060
 we hold the basal ends tightly 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.130
 of the cerbo this will be rather hair screed 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.590
 on the stretch of the love between the eyelet 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.560
 eyes and let's stop it with narrow gili 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.269
 we do assembly of silk 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.370
 be careful not to slide forward 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.530
 silk coils just sometimes 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.049
 otherwise we risk loosening and 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.330
 that no longer retain hair for 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.730
 avoid this inconvenience we bring the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.440
 silk close to the eyelet we supply 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.840
 the apex of the motorcycle museum 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.030
 and let us make a good counter 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.590
 the other the coils of silk while the 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.070
 we wrap directing there towards the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.920
 eyes we pass the thin yarn and 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.350
 ice let's lay down the yellow hairs on the hollow 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.720
 between the eyes and let's stop them in that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.960
 position wrapping the silk immediately 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.300
 behind the small red barbell from 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.310
 a skein of flash about gold 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:58.000
 we cut a small bundle of long 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.680
 filaments let us place the central section of the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.960
 filaments of flash about under 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.700
 fly eyes and tie it with 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.700
 a few rounds of assembly silk 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.690
 we reverse the section 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.460
 front of the tuft of flash about e 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:23.950
 let's stop it with the assembly wire 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:26.530
 above the back we grab i 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.930
 golden filaments push them towards the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.919
 tail of the fly molin italy flush 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.480
 of the tips of bach take hairs 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.060
 we choose a new substantial bunch 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.160
 of hair from the tail of yellow deer and 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:47.800
 we also cut this flush with the skin 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:50.169
 from which it is erected we remove the micro 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.570
 fluff and hair shorter from the tuft of 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.050
 bach tail and then insert it into the tie 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.050
 sleeping 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.140
 we beat the basis of the draw appeal 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.650
 on the work table to align the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.650
 toes 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.470
 keeping the bach tuft tight 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.370
 tel we cut a small section of the 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.560
 its lower end we approach the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.510
 base of the hairs on the front part of the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.550
 mot and let's stop it with silk from 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.430
 construction just behind and below 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.530
 the eyelet we continue to turn the 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.680
 yarn to make a small head 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.200
 conical in shape by tightening with energy 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.800
 spire to hold i firmly 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.690
 we ask for the giver year 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.820
 we hook it to the silk and form one 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.820
 set of knots on the fly's face 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.120
 serious molin and with the scissors we cut 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.120
 the assembly yarn 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.950
 we take a second coil tore 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.300
 loaded with a silk spool of 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.360
 orange mounting 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.790
 fluorescent and stop the yarn at 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.950
 central section of the nose 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:21.990
 of the artificial we cut the head 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.990
 excess of building silk 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.430
 so we make a kind of small 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.890
 ring around the central section of the 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:34.360
 streamer museum forced tours of the 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:36.580
 orange thread we take the giver year and 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:44.530
 we use it to make some i 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:52.660
 nodini seria molin and finally we cut the 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:54.850
 assembly wire we pour from 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.860
 cyan acrylic glue bottle one 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.990
 series of micro drops on the entire nose 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.990
 of the fly to weld the silk 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.260
 we distribute some of the adhesive also 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:13.240
 on the loops of thread that hold i 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.340
 deer hair behind eyes la 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.890
 construction of the yellow klauser is 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:22.110
 come to an end and our voluminous 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.110
 moscow is ready to deceive a handsome guy
