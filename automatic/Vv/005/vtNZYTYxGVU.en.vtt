00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.780
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 we find ourselves for a new tutorial on 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.859
 my office is easy I made a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.789
 tutorial before the museum connection 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.529
 cap so you said I would have done 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.660
 a video about the music software ap 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:36.760
 so called ulad videostudio this dvd so 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.149
 you open the adams buses at the beginning 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.010
 I have a little bit of time but here you go 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.670
 so you have studio video editors 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.340
 movie assistant is maybe both 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.660
 little wooden boxes you do not check 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:59.100
 so you go in referred wizard 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 assist a movie so 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:10.350
 I put in full screen of course good 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.110
 so here's once you get there 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.110
 above you have in capture 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 excuse me his charge 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.189
 so you are in source you will have had 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 the name of the music ap - it is called s and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.020
 migrate their currencies so I click 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.070
 above 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.960
 there you put it to life but wmv I want 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.659
 say you do not put it especially to yourself 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.570
 do not put dvd because dvd 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.950
 it's a black and white film 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.940
 I have a bit difficult to hand over 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 colors after day show so here is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.170
 so you have to option to futures and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:04.470
 capture options so the culture is 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.679
 library was naked at 25 thousand 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.569
 frames per second or you let yourself 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.080
 put if you do not have it yet 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.150
 so I press rock to sing 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 property settings options 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.530
 video and audio capture so without entering 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.100
 you will put composite video 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.100
 tv systems ccam audio devices 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 microphone ball on behalf of your headphones 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.709
 Newts or others are centered volume 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.640
 main a small box use psi 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.109
 audio I'm more than that but I know 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.910
 that you could go to see on 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.480
 other videos 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.989
 so me things like that so in 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.989
 colors we'll see it after and capture on 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:02.040
 let's put ok so here I turn on 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:11.100
 my console you will see the image that 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:13.709
 going his share so be the gic could film to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.709
 I am too much of these good qualities 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.970
 1 for a small a small box 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.270
 acquisition 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.260
 it's not bad so I can finally if we 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.090
 can call it an acquisition box 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.820
 in a form of usb key game so this is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.210
 once you're here on it I'll 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.460
 show you 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.840
 what does it do with the dvd we 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.570
 promise dvd format and you are going 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.140
 see that it's a black and white to have 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:48.750
 not even good excuse me so you do 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.550
 when you wanted to move this wmv it's me 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.590
 his load 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.510
 So here we are after we turn around and 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.740
 capture property settings options 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:03.660
 video and audio colors 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:09.100
 I have a little bit of a bone 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.350
 frozen contrast so it's under 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.310
 of you increase it is purple 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 it's done it's special I feel it 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.620
 inverse saturation this the same thing I 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.770
 can not say anything 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:32.280
 net this year you were I like to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 bottom that it is also I rattle on 6 gb / s 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.760
 range but pin ben you see we see 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.500
 that slab 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.350
 and if I go to the bottom we see better 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:51.700
 so here you manage our saying so 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:54.070
 here after to launch this game there for 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.400
 start the video it's not complicated 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.930
 all you have to capture video is ok 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.090
 throw in the tome you're going to have to 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.900
 wait two seconds it'll launch 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.790
 automatically video tape for 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.540
 stop it must not click twice 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.460
 that trond 1 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.310
 it's going to make a little bug or I do not know 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.400
 what is that where I showed you quickly 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.460
 done on the screen to see you for 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.040
 So show you hold wedges 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.820
 there is a small gap but that's 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.410
 not important 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:31.139
 after i know for those who want 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:34.050
 to make videos like that so that's it 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:37.439
 at the end of this lasts the end of this 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.319
 video will end 6 and I get 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:43.139
 found for a new video or for 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:46.680

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:50.159

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.330
 tell you otherwise go times subscribers 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.340
 my string adds a green thumb or whatever 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.789
 you want to share as long as it makes me 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.169
 pleasure 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:02.789
