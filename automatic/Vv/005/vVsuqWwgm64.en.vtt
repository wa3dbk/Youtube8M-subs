00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 good what is the youtube friend 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.730
 we are here this new video of fifa 13 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.429
 ultimate team and good we are here in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 good in the templates where they 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 they teach my new template is still 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.189
 from the barclays but young there are many 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.680
 changes go more than the entire defense and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 well let's start 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.010
 first tower remembers that I 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.620
 he had connected he said good de gea 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.960
 is a very good goalkeeper if it is a way of 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.890
 goalkeeper for those who do not have much 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.870
 so much pasta so much money is excellent 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 I really recommend them more than 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 July Cesar Galvez and very good very good 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.460
 truth of gea very very good goalkeeper very 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.559
 good goalkeeper and also for those who 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.660
 have a league team 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.910
 of the Spanish league 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.100
 Spanish as it is Spanish can fit 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.280
 more or less fine 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.300
 but I'm saving especially 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.350
 for joe hart 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.690
 joe hart and good for that now I have 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.229
 Wednesday I want to be not only is 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.990
 better than de gea but that is to shrink and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.729
 ximo 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 those who have seen the supercampeons 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.520
 you can compare this archer with benji 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.070
 price in truth everything clear cap that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 not only invincible archer I say archers 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 invincible but but that saves me from 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 nonsense and knows nonsense that makes my 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.939
 defense sometimes yes good but de gea 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's also bad I do not change it because it's 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.390
 bad but because I wanted to have a better 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.240
 archer nothing more since he had a lot 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 money and I wanted to buy an archer and I 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.090
 I bought at a time ago a good time 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.060
 110 but for that amount of time I had 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.200
 lescott here in the central defense of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.659
 central defense now I have kabul and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.899
 aver milling are not painted well because 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.299
 they define well but now I have very few 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.970
 coins but I'm working right now and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.610
 the next purchase is going to be touré and I already 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.530
 I'm going to start showing that but here 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.740
 I think I'm going to change one of the two 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 descents that were before is 1000 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.540
 and scott mitchell obviously I think of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.190
 scott is the only one that will be like 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.150
 alternate 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.790
 when example this this wants ensures 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.150
 a game of I put a defense 5 and it's 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.620
 the cougar center of lescott and good 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.950
 because we have to get out because look 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.100
 This goes very well in the head and new in the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.320
 defense this is much faster but 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.260
 has a little less decency and a 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.090
 little less than head and I do not know not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.569
 he 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.739
 from left side that therefore I think 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.170
 that like this I will stay until the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.000
 final raise clicks I think because with it 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.800
 I'm not convinced and jose enrique very good 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.530
 and also with pennetta with arriving 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.530
 walker I have it because it performs very well 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.650
 however, I think I 'm going to change it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.350
 now from here a decade a time for 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.140
 maicon by richard no and I already tried it to 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.400
 richards and he did not tell me at all but 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.520
 from here a time also does not change 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 walker but it's not essential it's because 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.230
 I've been fine that was also lenin va 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.230
 very well 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.390
 the thing is that I've seen the states 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.510
 where is de touré and it's much better 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.670
 but maybe it 's a little lower but it 's 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.299
 much better in the states I will try 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.010
 the two of you and well liner knows 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.579
 always for example put on every October 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 instead of this uncle because because no no 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.900
 It convinces me completely that goal is issued 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.599
 but 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.790
 did not mitigate the study well pass but the 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.030
 states do not tell me everything but defend 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.299
 that is not a very average player 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.610
 it acts well but it is well average we do not 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.799
 in an excellent game it is always there 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.799
 it's always good it never stays like 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.019
 idiot like I've ever defended him 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.780
 will return whole no more than all that 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:17.549
 have good here 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.639
 steven gerard another nice I do not think that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.340
 not worth what you pay for truth 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.350
 not worth not follow another video 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.670
 I said yes but now I say no 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.399
 because he did not score goals 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.699
 did not give me birth today marked 

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:41.179
 665 I do not know how much I want it to be less 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:45.529
 good 65 but it will not have been expected 

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:48.529
 to the free year but no no no not worth the 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:51.110
 worth what you pay for it if you really do not 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:54.529
 there are much better I do not think there 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.999
 better mc better the sms or 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:03.679
 but change it so change it to ms or amc 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:07.309
 and what I hate is that I play badly 

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:09.379
 not that to fit a player like him 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:11.779
 precious that there is the same a good 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:15.199
 I could have saved a lot of money but 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.209
 since I have it good I 'm not going to 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.759
 change it has very good glass of wine in 

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:22.219
 shot but but never again a 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:26.269
 9.1 explosion is not always a 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:28.339
 performance from 9 up does not fall from 8 

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:30.079
 but they are not complete either 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:30.529
 it makes as good positions as they were 

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:34.309
 to see now 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.569
 stobart this player the second one is the 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:40.549
 I love the team I'll put as 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:43.189
 captain standing as captain but as 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:46.519
 captain but you have to follow a 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:48.889
 excellent rhythm function a lot 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:51.949
 speed is that no defense can 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.229
 with him and he defines very well and the shots 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.659
 distant change from outside the area too 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.470
 with the right I want to see if he is left-handed 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:02.110
 straight 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:04.100
 left but a musician type but 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.820
 very good a member 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.430
 I want to test your version of your app and 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.070
 good that we have the child towers not what 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.240
 change for nothing is very good is 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.810
 perfectly 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.759
 very well very well truth if I'm not going to 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.979
 change should not change what I'm going to rotate 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:26.610
 question I'm going to eat is another fixed well 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:28.750
 like jose enrique and hard the prefixes in 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.170
 team 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.060
 daughter be this I have not tried it 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.710
 purchased right now present under 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.170
 money and apart that I'm buying 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.970
 players to create but well I'm going to 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.950
 try and discount that such the engine the 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.270
 next video good friends then he has 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.390

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.300
