tutorial I'm gonna show you how to edit
this<00:00:07.529> raw<00:00:07.950> file<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.639> Lightroom<00:00:09.150> 3<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.960> I'm

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
this raw file in Lightroom 3 and I'm

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.789 
this raw file in Lightroom 3 and I'm
going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.250> apply<00:00:11.870> basically<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> big<00:00:13.259> thing

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
going to apply basically the big thing

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.829 
going to apply basically the big thing
for<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.099> tutorial<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.730> applying<00:00:15.210> noise

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
for this tutorial is applying noise

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.519 
for this tutorial is applying noise
reduction<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.340> first<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> all<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.380> an

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
reduction so first of all this is an

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.759 
reduction so first of all this is an
available<00:00:20.130> light<00:00:20.310> shot<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.090> nikon<00:00:21.769> d7000

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
available light shot with my nikon d7000

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.089 
available light shot with my nikon d7000
using<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> 85<00:00:23.970> millimeter<00:00:24.390> f-14<00:00:25.109> Sigma<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
using the 85 millimeter f-14 Sigma the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.509 
using the 85 millimeter f-14 Sigma the
prime<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.420> ISO<00:00:28.070> 6400<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.160> looks<00:00:29.429> pretty

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
prime it is at ISO 6400 and looks pretty

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.440 
prime it is at ISO 6400 and looks pretty
good<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.390> ISO<00:00:30.779> 6400<00:00:31.679> that's<00:00:32.130> available<00:00:33.000> light

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
good for ISO 6400 that's available light

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.290 
good for ISO 6400 that's available light
now<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.899> available<00:00:34.739> light<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.340> some<00:00:35.790> CFL

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
now the available light is some CFL

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
now the available light is some CFL
bulbs<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> living<00:00:37.320> room<00:00:37.500> some<00:00:37.739> compact

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
bulbs in the living room some compact

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369 
bulbs in the living room some compact
fluorescents<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> white<00:00:39.809> balance<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
fluorescents so the white balance is a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
fluorescents so the white balance is a
little<00:00:40.469> off<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> little<00:00:41.550> too<00:00:41.700> red<00:00:42.000> so

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
little off you're a little too red so

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.119 
little off you're a little too red so
first<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.110> I'm<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.469> try<00:00:43.800> Auto

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
first of all I'm just gonna try Auto

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
first of all I'm just gonna try Auto
here<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.719> better<00:00:46.050> cleans<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> up

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
here that's much better cleans it up

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
here that's much better cleans it up
quite<00:00:47.219> nicely<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> then<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> next

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
quite nicely there and then the next

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
quite nicely there and then the next
thing<00:00:49.649> we're<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> go

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
thing we're gonna do is I'm going to go

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290 
thing we're gonna do is I'm going to go
down<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.050> change<00:00:53.010> my<00:00:53.190> camera<00:00:53.579> profile<00:00:54.030> from

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
down to change my camera profile from

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.180 
down to change my camera profile from
Adobe<00:00:54.719> standard<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:56.750> camera<00:00:57.750> standard<00:00:58.289> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
Adobe standard to camera standard or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450 
Adobe standard to camera standard or
camera<00:01:00.000> portrait<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> don't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
camera portrait now see here I don't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.460 
camera portrait now see here I don't
like<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> portrait<00:01:04.400> neutrals<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.700> bad

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
like the portrait neutrals not bad

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100 
like the portrait neutrals not bad
cameras<00:01:07.470> standards<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.280> bad<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.900> actually

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
cameras standards not bad so I actually

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.080 
cameras standards not bad so I actually
don't<00:01:10.470> mind<00:01:10.590> Adobe<00:01:11.280> standard<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> little

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
don't mind Adobe standard here a little

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
don't mind Adobe standard here a little
pink<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> looks<00:01:13.290> good<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
pink but it kind of looks good with the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.320 
pink but it kind of looks good with the
little<00:01:14.159> ones<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> skin<00:01:15.090> tones<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:18.210> we'll

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
little ones on the skin tones but we'll

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
little ones on the skin tones but we'll
go<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.860> will<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.159> camera<00:01:20.549> standard

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
go with will go with camera standard

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
go with will go with camera standard
here<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.520> pull<00:01:23.820> my

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here and then I think I'm gonna pull my

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.050 
here and then I think I'm gonna pull my
white<00:01:24.150> balance<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.110> bit<00:01:26.060> maybe

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
white balance up just a little bit maybe

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.340 
white balance up just a little bit maybe
up<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.220> 2,900<00:01:29.869> maybe<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> gotta<00:01:31.110> leave<00:01:31.320> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
up to 2,900 maybe I gotta leave that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.789 
up to 2,900 maybe I gotta leave that
there<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.799> try<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.159> tint<00:01:33.320> there<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:34.770> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
there and try the tint there we go I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.050 
there and try the tint there we go I
like<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.520> bit<00:01:35.610> better<00:01:35.759> they're

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
like that a little bit better they're

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.630 
like that a little bit better they're
getting<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.600> bit<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:37.070> whitey<00:01:38.070> pink<00:01:38.490> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
getting a little bit more whitey pink in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.359 
getting a little bit more whitey pink in
the<00:01:38.759> skin<00:01:39.060> tones<00:01:39.530> there<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.860> let's<00:01:41.130> try

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the skin tones there we go let's try

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.030 
the skin tones there we go let's try
that<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.670> 12<00:01:41.970> okay<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.680> I've<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.920> my

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that at 12 okay so there I've got my

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
that at 12 okay so there I've got my
color<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.450> looks<00:01:45.630> pretty

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
color the way I like it it looks pretty

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
color the way I like it it looks pretty
good<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.290> available<00:01:46.770> light<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.280> compact

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
good for available light in a compact

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.630 
good for available light in a compact
fluorescent<00:01:48.240> bulb<00:01:48.450> situation<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.439> I'm<00:01:50.280> going

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
fluorescent bulb situation and I'm going

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
fluorescent bulb situation and I'm going
to<00:01:50.670> add<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.570> noise<00:01:51.780> reduction<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.189> first

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to add the noise reduction now so first

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.730 
to add the noise reduction now so first
of<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.970> gonna<00:01:54.180> crank<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.750> color<00:01:55.170> noise

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
of all I'm gonna crank my color noise

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.490 
of all I'm gonna crank my color noise
reduction<00:01:56.159> all<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> hundred

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
reduction all the way up to a hundred

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.609 
reduction all the way up to a hundred
basically<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:58.860> no<00:01:59.750> drawback<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.170> going

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
basically there's no drawback to going

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.109 
basically there's no drawback to going
to<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> hundred<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> color<00:02:02.880> noise

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
to a hundred on the color noise

negative aspect of that really so we're

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.510

the<00:02:22.150> difference<00:02:22.600> there<00:02:22.870> -<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.520> it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
the difference there - there it's it's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.990 
the difference there - there it's it's
slight<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.410> noticeable<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:27.910> I'm

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
slight but it's noticeable and then I'm

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
slight but it's noticeable and then I'm
gonna<00:02:28.120> take<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.260> luminance<00:02:29.860> noise

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
gonna take this the luminance noise

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.070 
gonna take this the luminance noise
reduction<00:02:30.790> up<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:31.270> just<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> move<00:02:31.840> this

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080

reduction up I'm just going to move this
up<00:02:32.140> here<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:34.030> probably<00:02:34.960> looks<00:02:35.560> about

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
up here and I think probably looks about

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.860 
up here and I think probably looks about
15<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.610> where<00:02:36.790> we're<00:02:36.910> gonna<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.240> want<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.570> be<00:02:37.690> on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
15 is where we're gonna be want to be on

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
15 is where we're gonna be want to be on
that<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.550> I'm<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.200> crank<00:02:42.100> the

that and then I'm going to crank the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.120 
that and then I'm going to crank the
detail<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.390> here<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:44.320> basically<00:02:44.770> tell

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
detail up here to basically tell

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.120 
detail up here to basically tell
Lightroom<00:02:45.610> hey<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.820> want<00:02:46.180> 15<00:02:47.040> luminance<00:02:48.040> noise

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.010 
Lightroom hey I want 15 luminance noise
reduction<00:02:48.640> but<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.030> want<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.480> retain<00:02:49.870> as

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
reduction but I want you to retain as

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.350 
reduction but I want you to retain as
much<00:02:50.260> detail<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:50.860> possible<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.150> looks

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
much detail as possible so this looks

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.630 
much detail as possible so this looks
pretty<00:02:52.450> good<00:02:52.720> there<00:02:53.140> I'm<00:02:53.680> happy<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
pretty good there I'm happy with that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.300 
pretty good there I'm happy with that
and<00:02:55.410> basically<00:02:56.410> when<00:02:56.560> you're<00:02:56.680> looking<00:02:57.160> at

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and basically when you're looking at

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.090 
and basically when you're looking at
these<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.960> is<00:02:59.170> about<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.530> size<00:02:59.770> maybe

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
these here this is about the size maybe

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.500 
these here this is about the size maybe
a<00:03:00.220> tad<00:03:00.460> bigger<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.940> you're<00:03:01.090> gonna<00:03:01.180> want<00:03:01.450> to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
a tad bigger that you're gonna want to

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.030 
a tad bigger that you're gonna want to
look<00:03:01.720> at<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.110> how<00:03:02.320> it's<00:03:02.590> gonna<00:03:02.680> look<00:03:02.800> like

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
look at to see how it's gonna look like

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
look at to see how it's gonna look like
as<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> finished<00:03:03.580> image<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.600> start<00:03:04.840> pixel

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
as a finished image you start pixel

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.840 
as a finished image you start pixel
peeping<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:05.890> level<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.430> one<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.820> two

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
peeping at this level like one to two

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.450 
peeping at this level like one to two
and<00:03:07.590> you're<00:03:08.590> gonna<00:03:08.710> see<00:03:08.980> stuff<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.250> you're

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
and you're gonna see stuff that you're

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.250 
and you're gonna see stuff that you're
never<00:03:09.670> gonna<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.210> a<00:03:10.270> print<00:03:10.570> or<00:03:10.750> never<00:03:10.990> see

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
never gonna see in a print or never see

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.540 
never gonna see in a print or never see
it<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.410> proper<00:03:11.800> viewing<00:03:12.270> angle<00:03:13.270> or<00:03:13.450> viewing

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
it a proper viewing angle or viewing

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.000 
it a proper viewing angle or viewing
distance<00:03:15.550> so<00:03:16.300> basically<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.350> looks<00:03:17.650> really

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
distance so basically this looks really

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.070 
distance so basically this looks really
good<00:03:18.280> I'm<00:03:18.490> happy<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.240> it<00:03:19.510> looks<00:03:19.690> sharp

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
good I'm happy with this it looks sharp

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.400 
good I'm happy with this it looks sharp
it<00:03:20.290> looks<00:03:20.500> clean<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:21.520> ISO<00:03:21.959> 6400<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.080> think<00:03:23.350> it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it looks clean for ISO 6400 I think it

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.390 
it looks clean for ISO 6400 I think it
looks<00:03:23.590> pretty<00:03:23.920> darn<00:03:24.130> good

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
looks pretty darn good

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.320 
looks pretty darn good

compact fluorescent bulb lighting so

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.550 
compact fluorescent bulb lighting so
there<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.580> folks<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.260> image

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
there you go folks that is the image

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.280 
there you go folks that is the image
once<00:03:33.520> we've<00:03:33.700> edited<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:34.630> some<00:03:34.930> noise

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.440 
once we've edited it with some noise
reduction<00:03:35.650> there's<00:03:36.520> what<00:03:36.760> we<00:03:36.880> started<00:03:37.330> out

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
reduction there's what we started out

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.290 
reduction there's what we started out
