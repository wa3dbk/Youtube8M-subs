 rodrigues once again here to do 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.870
 a video for you and this time I will 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.750
 teach you to download and install the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.560
 tony hawk pro skater 3 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 There are a lot of people there, to walk to that. 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.109
 game just to want to remember the good times 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.619
 there or to play because you think well 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.859
 It's funny, I've been looking for jathay to leave. 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.559
 give this program 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.980
 I looked for tea and found a way 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.670
 use the week is easier it has many 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.410
 sometimes many difficult ways to do 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:50.309
 I think the easiest way to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 today to download a lot of things to do is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.239
 do not need this program from a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'll come back and leave you behind 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:07.189
 and this is a first and I'll let it be 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.189
 another video also on your page 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.270
 download the game here already a 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 complete set of carefree games that are 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.170
 Downloading the game is going now 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.920
 complete on the lid 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.420
 then it will not be resolved soon there will not be 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.299
 appear from here when the right and the use is 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 This page exactly 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.340
 I'll redo it for you to learn how 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.140
 Why is it so wrong? 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.299
 formula you can not play there 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.130
 so let's write it twice in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.780
 top of the game 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 ok you can see here always gives 96/97 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.040
 one locked 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.190
 Do not worry, it 's normal. 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.229
 Eighteen of the pine trees that are normal 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.649
 happens every computer in the pec is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.770
 near if your computer you have this 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.760
 problem then yes automatically say 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:28.790
 exactly the one for that page to 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:31.519
 I have already installed another framework 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.239
 white here for you to tighten and 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 it works there is something at least six 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.989
 squeeze and go here again here too 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:46.310
 It 's hard to see two teams 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.580
 and here it will look like this all in white 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.070
 you fill in the two boxes and 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.850
 It will close here when that comes 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.820
 part has install trying to install 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.030
 gates already had a good computer here 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.430
 but if you there you can install and go 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.920
 open the debate in this way in the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.510
 your computer 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.549

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.320
 step with 62 this problem and yes again 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.010
 and will appear this rate did not appear in the 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.750
 page 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.530
 The only thing you need to do is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.790
 Squeeze, okay, I'm going to retire here. 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.870
 Pressing will open the game 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.579
