00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.829
 hello today in atlanta deal with you 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.209
 Yuri Sidorenko and unique cameras with 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.480
 translucent mirror sony arpad 55 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.730
 the first thing that strikes you very much 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.499
 small case will appreciate it 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:25.550
 travelers 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.410
 but support the little finger bottom 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.169
 at first it is unusual 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.009
 top panel design produces 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.669
 dual impression ring 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.480
 mode selection is located on the left a 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.030
 then one hand is not enough 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.710
 where usually on the right 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 additional void indicator 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.190
 filled couple unsuccessfully standing 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.059
 buttons but this is the only one 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.450
 claim to economy 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.660
 on the back is a deal 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.460
 can lcd high resolution display 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 the swivel mechanism is down below they 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.380
 left and this decision is very competent 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.470
 firstly it takes only one movement 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.900
 to translate it from marching to 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.350
 working position 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.720
 secondly when sighting from above and 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.050
 bottom center of the display match 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.950
 with optical save plane 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.590
 camera which makes framing easier 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.750
 memory card and battery are closed 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.230
 common lid on the bottom panel when 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.270
 extraction comrat work careful 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.920
 spring shoots him quite actively 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 metallic that dark days up 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.660
 positioned so most tripods 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.960
 do not block access to edema with a card 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 memory and how omul the author 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.550
 m 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.880
 so what is the dynamics 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969
 sony company first digital era 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.259
 created a camera with translucent 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.250
 a mirror 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.210
 pay attention to the design 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.290
 translucent mirror used 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 only for the direction of the light part 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.999
 flow 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.500
 sensor phase in autofocus 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.650
 when you press the shutter button it does not 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.750
 rises and it gives the camera 2 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.710
 undeniable advantage 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.380
 First burst speed 10 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 frames per second at full resolution 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.909
 matrix 16 megapixels and in 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.740
 a buffer of 20 frames that means you don’t 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.539
 skip the interesting phase 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.869
 sporting event and handshake 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.690
 President's second autofocus sensors 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 continue to work even at the time of shooting 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.770
 which allows the camera to follow linger 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.560
 parallel optical bones 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.209
 lens objects 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.239
 translucent mirror reflects 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.269
 too little light to look for them 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.409
 was optical 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.349
 so sony made it or throne 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.029
 the only minus to such a decision 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.709
 increased power consumption 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.049
 viewfinder quality 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:36.920
 great 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430
 with a diagonal of less than half an inch on it 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.590
 almost half a million points even 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.459
 no additional increase 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.560
 manual one-time focus 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.529
 pleasure 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.289
 does translucent affect 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.139
 mirror on the quality of shooting 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.169
 at values ​​a ee od one thousand six hundred 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.079
 practically no 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.509
 Thanks to the stock of the sensor, the ex morgue 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.029
 children 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.789
 by eye you do not distinguish frames made by sony 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.649
 albert 55 from other mirror images 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.319
 cameras 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.209
 however, an extremely high share with 12800 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.639
 not worth using detail noticeable 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.709
 reduced would go to this answer post 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.289
 processing virtually 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.649
 impossible to remove without consequences 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.429
 some photographers say that 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:19.499
 translucent mirror can give 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.899
 stray outlines around bright objects 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.440
 with evening shooting 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.340
 I can not boast thousands of similar 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.079
 frames but I did not notice them 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.969
 m 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.139
 sony and so 55 very interesting camera 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.839
 which will be appreciated 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:37.509
 photographers interested 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.949
 high speed shooting 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.189
 its small weight and dimensions will be pleasant 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:42.499
 travelers 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.149
 add to this the shooting function 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.879
 panorama them in automatic 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.719
 non-tripod mode and excellent quality 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.789
