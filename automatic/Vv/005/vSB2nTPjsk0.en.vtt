00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.100

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.400

 that system on youtube right but 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.530
 I did not see any so this way 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.929
 with the dialing system which is what I 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.730
 I made stitches here and it's automatic too 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.399

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.110

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 project tim who does not see how he said it yet 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.880
 Nothing happens to you when you 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.910

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.860
 thing when you go you wanted it 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.850
 prevents your bucket from water and try 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.470
 again 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.180

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 I caught it inadvertently picked me 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.360
 but there the point to make the gift there I go back 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.070

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 Chin mode to show you here. 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.770
 you feared right a very basic system 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.440
 from year to year for a sac as I did that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.450
 System to read up there upstairs I 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.840
 I used this bock command with tpi as 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.550
 coordinates up there well is this other 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.390
 here's a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.670
 Oops, here the guys have a 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.220
 another form of tango bloch that gives you the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.990
 bucket of water and ian let me see 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.790
 here she has another one as the boxing is 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.310
 strong up there did not want a 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.360
 between him and the history of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 until the other side of here I put 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 a little door here but open back there 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.130
 to see better get out here and the O 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.630
 Everyone answers what passes that one. 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.880
 increases one point 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.970
 and here is the reset button 10 for you 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.740
 a reservation here in that video was just that 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.080
 I even wanted to show you the download of the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.700
 Map in the video description is good for 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.340
 You train if you want, if you can. 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.900
 modify the Praa and higher in this map 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.150
 people would find it very peaceful that I 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.310
 I left because for me really beginner 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.000
 This map here guys and one thing I 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:07.430
 I could never do it, I'll try it here. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.930
 it's zero to throw a bucket to get the box there 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.820
 "It's almost cool, it's hard to leave." 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.680
