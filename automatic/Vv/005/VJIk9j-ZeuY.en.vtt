there's a red bit on the end of one and
that<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.769> goes<00:00:47.039> across<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.820> way<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.269> 10

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that one goes across the way of the 10

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.430 
that one goes across the way of the 10
and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.620> other<00:00:49.769> to<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.420> diagonally<00:00:53.149> these

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
and the other to put diagonally these

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
and the other to put diagonally these
tweet<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.769> two<00:00:56.100> poles<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.670> diagonally

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
tweet the two poles that go diagonally

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.020 
tweet the two poles that go diagonally
in<00:00:57.749> their<00:00:58.140> turn<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.010> still<00:00:59.339> got<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> put<00:00:59.879> in

there are two ends of the pole one end
has<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.950> flat<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.870> which<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:13.050> like<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
has a flat bit which is like that and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
has a flat bit which is like that and
the<00:01:14.340> other<00:01:14.370> hand<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.900> earn<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.620> curved

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the other hand has earn like a curved

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
the other hand has earn like a curved
bit<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:19.490> n/m<00:01:20.490> thing<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
bit like that and this n/m thing and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.480 
bit like that and this n/m thing and
look<00:01:22.770> somewhere<00:01:23.190> into<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.210> spit

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.460 

the<00:01:27.820> flat<00:01:28.120> end<00:01:28.390> locate<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.909> shot<00:01:31.750> bit<00:01:32.049> that's

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
the flat end locate the shot bit that's

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.200 
the flat end locate the shot bit that's
here<00:01:32.850> somewhere<00:01:33.850> there<00:01:35.100> enough<00:01:36.100> it<00:01:36.280> goes<00:01:36.490> here

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
here somewhere there enough it goes here

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.880 
here somewhere there enough it goes here
and<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.570> can<00:01:37.750> tell<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.320> does<00:01:38.440> cause

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
and you can tell that it does cause

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.730 
and you can tell that it does cause
there's<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.250> red<00:01:39.490> strip<00:01:40.450> going<00:01:40.690> across<00:01:41.110> here

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
there's a red strip going across here

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.830 
there's a red strip going across here
and<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.340> matches<00:01:42.729> well<00:01:42.850> we've<00:01:43.360> laid<00:01:43.540> out<00:01:43.690> of

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
and that matches well we've laid out of

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.450 
and that matches well we've laid out of
ten<00:01:44.050> this<00:01:44.350> bit<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> little<00:01:44.740> bit<00:01:44.950> too<00:01:45.100> difficult

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
ten this bit a little bit too difficult

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
ten this bit a little bit too difficult
for<00:01:45.820> miles<00:01:46.119> as<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.690> need<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:47.140> bit<00:01:47.470> muscle<00:01:47.860> by<00:01:48.190> me

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
for miles as you need a bit muscle by me

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.630 
for miles as you need a bit muscle by me
so<00:01:50.229> what<00:01:50.409> we're<00:01:50.500> going<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.649> do<00:01:50.800> first<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
so what we're going to do first and the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.670 
so what we're going to do first and the
instructions<00:01:52.149> are<00:01:52.240> not<00:01:52.360> very<00:01:52.570> clear<00:01:52.810> we're

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
instructions are not very clear we're

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.990 
instructions are not very clear we're
going<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.860> try<00:01:54.009> pushing<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:54.460> pole<00:01:54.700> across

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
going to try pushing this pole across

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.240 
going to try pushing this pole across
first<00:01:57.360> push<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.540> pit<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.020> I'm<00:01:59.979> assuming

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
first push this pit and I'm assuming

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.730 
first push this pit and I'm assuming
that<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.700> right<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.590> said<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
that this is right because said the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.400 
that this is right because said the
instructions<00:02:03.250> are<00:02:03.369> really<00:02:03.520> not<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.060> clear

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
instructions are really not that clear

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.260 
instructions are really not that clear
find<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.530> bit<00:02:05.740> under<00:02:05.979> here<00:02:06.190> push<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.090> through

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
find this bit under here push it through

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:18.089 
find this bit under here push it through
and<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.229> fits<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.709> there
