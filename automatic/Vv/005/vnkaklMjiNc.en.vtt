00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.700
 what I wanted to do with the palette 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.279
 naked 3 since good because we had 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.779
 made a review of this palette but 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.880
 he had put us no proposal for 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.640
 look good because the look is this is the one 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.649
 I bring, I think it's very beautiful what 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.950
 I consider more suitable for the night because 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.290
 good has intense shadows and very 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.550
 blurred but good as this is 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 question of tastes because if you want it 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.219
 take a day because perfect nothing I leave you 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.409
 with the images of how I did the 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.780
 look with the naked palette 3 I hope that you 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.909
 like to remember that I have social networks 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.640
 you have them all in the box 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.409
 information below in the direct links 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.079
 and nothing that I hope you enjoy them 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.079
 thank you very much and see you soon 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.200
 Well, let's start applying 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.909
 these shadows always right after 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.560
 have prepared the eyelid with a 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.409
 prebase for shadows 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.360
 this is the shadow limit we're going to 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.270
 put with a brush to blend in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.580
 this case I am using 217 of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.930
 mac and I'm going to put it right in the basin 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.930
 blurring the at the same time 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.060
 so we're going to create the effect of 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.620
 transition from the beginning so that 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.720
 then it will not be much easier 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.120
 blur it and make it more integrated 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.060
 now let's intensify just that 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.520
 zone with the shadow in an er and applied 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.830
 just above the shadow the limit 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.320
 let's also use another brush 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.360
 to blur this in particular is from 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.100
 bell ville and of a tools 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.410
 as you see we have put it right in the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.170
 edge cited right in the part of the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.630
 basin and we have been blurring it towards 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.310
 up very gently but without covering the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.910
 light pink color that we had put 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.910
 previously 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.340
 now let's take the shadow darkside 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.830
 with the help of this brush of zueva and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.410
 just with the tip what we're going to do 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.200
 is to apply it right at the edge of the eye 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.300
 inferior and raising it towards the temple thus 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.400
 let's create and delimit as a 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.380
 sort of eyeliner after what we're going 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.780
 to do is also mark the basin 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.330
 of the eye with the help of the brush also 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.459
 introducing the shadow towards the part 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.100
 inside of the eye let's do as a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.080
 species of basin line marked already 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.770
 we are going to blur a little bit 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.770
 upwards 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.239
 now let's catch the shadow again 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.099
 in an air and we are going to blur this 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.150
 marked basin that we have useful that we have 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.150
 made with dark shadow 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.640
 to light up below the eyebrow we're going to 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.490
 catch this shadow is the strange of the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.980
 same palette and with a brush also of 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.350
 apply shadows this is also new 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.350
 we apply it just below the eyebrow 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.740
 let's use another brush to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.050
 apply shadows and take the shadow das 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.180
 in this case I have moistened a little 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.640
 the brush so that the shadow remains 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.650
 much more fixed I used the mix without 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.470
 kiko solution we will apply 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.450
 right on the mobile eyelid without leaving 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.560
 no other side is to say just in 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.560
 what is the mobile eyelid 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.370
 Now let's take the bats shadow 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.950
 also with the brush moistened what 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.650
 let's apply outside the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.990
 mobile eyelid to intensify and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.850
 darken this area a little bit more and 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.760
 make a weathered effect on the eyelid 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.280
 much more beautiful mobile as when applying 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.250
 these shadows let's say that the basin that 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.110
 we have marked it has gone back to blur 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.850
 What we 're going to do a little bit is go back to 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.870
 mark and re-blur the how 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.870
 you are seeing in the images 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.720
 and now we are going to use an eyeliner 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.269
 in gel it is from maybelline and we are going to 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.359
 apply it only on the inner line 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.560
 the water line both lower and 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.440
 higher 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.030
 let's mark it very little we do not want 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.060
 that the black looks too intense 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.970
 now we take a very fine brush and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.639
 the shadow trick and let's light up what 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.530
 which is the lacrimal area after 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.630
 make up our eyelashes or else we 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 we put some false eyelashes in this 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.830
 I did not do it like that 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.300
 now let's mark the eyebrows is very 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.629
 important to delimit for 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.270
 intensify the look and give the eye a 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.770
 effect as more finished what I'm going to 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.490
 to do is simply make up 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.490
 slightly 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.880
 to which the look changes 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.800
 Well, this is the result of the 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.230
 finished eye I hope you like it 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.230
 now let's move on to the lips 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.259
 for this look that chosen this 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.979
 essence profiler is a pink tone 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:38.159
 very very clearly and this lipstick lip 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.710
 mac the labial is called angel and is very 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.810
 well known because it is a very nude pink 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.150
 beautiful and that is very flattering and 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.759
 you can use daily or makeups 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.680
 more intense as you see profile or 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.639
 totally lip to make it a 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.639
 slightly thicker 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.510
 and then with the bar 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.040
 angel lips I'm going to apply it on 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.500
 all the lip as you see has a color 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.260
 very very beautiful is a natural pink not 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.260
 very romantic and very very nice 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.289
 Now what I'm going to do is help 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.999
 outline a little bit the face I'm going to 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.550
 use these sun powders for it 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.259
 which they are the Nars Laguna what I do 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.569
 is simply apply it right in the 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.740
 lower part of the cheekbone to make a 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.740
 higher volume effect 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.349
 Apply the little apple a little 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.020
 give a golden touch to what is the 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.969
 cheek now with this zoÃ© blusher 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.309
 it's a very nice pink shade 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.839
 to apply a small amount just in 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.909
 the central part of the cheekbone to 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:52.449
 highlight it and give it a much more effect 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:52.449
 healthy 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.280
 and that's all girls I hope that I have 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.200
