00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

okay<00:00:00.510> let's<00:00:00.719> talk<00:00:00.840> about<00:00:00.900> fertilizer<00:00:01.589> and

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
okay let's talk about fertilizer and

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.510 
okay let's talk about fertilizer and
your<00:00:02.159> li-chee<00:00:02.340> tree<00:00:03.200> it<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.259> very<00:00:04.830> important

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
your li-chee tree it is very important

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.020 
your li-chee tree it is very important
with<00:00:06.060> lychee<00:00:06.509> trees<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.200> long<00:00:07.710> gantry's<00:00:08.309> to

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
with lychee trees and long gantry's to

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.419 
with lychee trees and long gantry's to
use<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> fertilizer<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.349> either<00:00:10.830> does<00:00:11.280> not

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
use a fertilizer that either does not

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
use a fertilizer that either does not
have<00:00:11.670> any<00:00:11.849> nitrogen<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.570> or<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.960> very<00:00:13.259> very

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
have any nitrogen in it or is very very

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.060 
have any nitrogen in it or is very very
low<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.920> nitrogen<00:00:14.099> but<00:00:15.030> emphasizes<00:00:16.070> potassium

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
low in nitrogen but emphasizes potassium

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.380 
low in nitrogen but emphasizes potassium
so<00:00:17.609> something<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.350> 4<00:00:19.350> 12<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> 2<00:00:20.550> 4<00:00:20.820> 8<00:00:21.060> or<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
so something like a 4 12 or a 2 4 8 or a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.500 
so something like a 4 12 or a 2 4 8 or a
4<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.930> 12<00:00:22.320> something<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> tree<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
4 to 12 something like that a tree this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.140 
4 to 12 something like that a tree this
age<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.109> 7<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.590> 8<00:00:25.650> years<00:00:25.830> old<00:00:26.150> you'd

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
age which is 7 or 8 years old you'd

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.980 
age which is 7 or 8 years old you'd
probably<00:00:27.359> use<00:00:27.590> 2<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> 3<00:00:28.920> pounds<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.640> fertilizer

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
probably use 2 to 3 pounds of fertilizer

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.319 
probably use 2 to 3 pounds of fertilizer
this<00:00:30.990> holds<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.859> pound<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:35.329> fertilizer

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
this holds about one pound of fertilizer

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.920 
this holds about one pound of fertilizer
and<00:00:36.890> really<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> idea<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.850> using<00:00:39.750> dry

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and really the idea in using dry

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
and really the idea in using dry
fertilizer<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.950> spread<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> evenly<00:00:41.640> under

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
fertilizer is to spread it evenly under

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.010 
fertilizer is to spread it evenly under
the<00:00:42.390> canopy<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> easily<00:00:44.579> by

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
the canopy and you can do that easily by

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.650 
the canopy and you can do that easily by
flicking<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> fertilizer<00:00:46.760> from<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.030> edge<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
flicking the fertilizer from the edge of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080 
flicking the fertilizer from the edge of
the<00:00:48.719> canopy<00:00:49.050> inward<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.640> around<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the canopy inward all the way around the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
the canopy inward all the way around the
tree<00:00:52.010> it's<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> be<00:00:53.250> hard<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
tree it's going to be hard for you to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.950 
tree it's going to be hard for you to
see<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.719> basically<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:56.660> move<00:00:57.660> some

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
see this but basically I can move some

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
see this but basically I can move some
branches<00:00:58.440> aside<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.760> inside<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> canopy

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
branches aside or get inside the canopy

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.260 
branches aside or get inside the canopy
and<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.829> winged<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.850> fertilizer<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.909> then

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and get winged this fertilizer and then

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
and get winged this fertilizer and then
with<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.770> fling<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> fertilizer<00:01:08.280> around

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with the fling this fertilizer around

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
with the fling this fertilizer around
the<00:01:09.150> tree<00:01:09.360> canopy<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> that's<00:01:10.320> all<00:01:10.560> that's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the tree canopy and that's all that's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.280 
the tree canopy and that's all that's
necessary<00:01:11.240> now<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.320> micro<00:01:14.130> element<00:01:14.610> or

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290

formulation of iron you mix it with
water<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> pour<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.860> solution

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
water and then you pour that solution

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
water and then you pour that solution
underneath<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> canopy<00:02:05.759> again<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.450> the

and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.660> can<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.410> you'll

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and you can do that now and you'll

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:21.080
