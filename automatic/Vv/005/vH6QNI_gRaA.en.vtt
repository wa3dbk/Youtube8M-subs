he had the bread is killing you see

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.660 
he had the bread is killing you see
right<00:02:16.840> through<00:02:17.080> no<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.860> guess<00:02:18.130> his<00:02:18.250> technique

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
right through no I guess his technique

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.130 
right through no I guess his technique
now<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.030> he's<00:02:19.180> gonna<00:02:19.330> eat<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.510> bread<00:02:19.810> later

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
now is he's gonna eat the bread later

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.960 
now is he's gonna eat the bread later
he's<00:02:20.470> eating<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.890> size<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.460> reps<00:02:21.670> right

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
he's eating in size of the reps right

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.850 
he's eating in size of the reps right
now<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.780> think<00:02:22.810> he's<00:02:23.290> gonna<00:02:23.440> try<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.680> eat

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.080 
now but I think he's gonna try to eat
the<00:02:23.950> bread<00:02:24.160> after<00:02:24.370> he's<00:02:24.610> finished<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
the bread after he's finished on the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.270 
the bread after he's finished on the
inside<00:02:25.120> watch<00:02:25.660> his<00:02:25.840> time<00:02:26.140> right<00:02:26.800> now<00:02:27.010> he's<00:02:27.250> a
