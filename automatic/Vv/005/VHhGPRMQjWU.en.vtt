00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.459 
there's a maximum but it's a lot more
than<00:01:50.829> you<00:01:51.430> usually<00:01:51.579> get<00:01:51.969> in<00:01:52.270> godney<00:01:52.960> gets<00:01:53.229> down

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
than you usually get in godney gets down

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.779 
than you usually get in godney gets down
I<00:01:53.500> don't<00:01:53.770> know<00:01:53.890> why<00:01:54.009> he<00:01:54.130> got<00:01:54.250> down<00:01:54.430> right<00:01:54.670> there

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.919 
I don't know why he got down right there
I<00:01:54.820> think<00:01:54.909> he<00:01:55.119> was<00:01:55.210> trying<00:01:55.359> to<00:01:55.479> freeze<00:01:55.719> himself

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
I think he was trying to freeze himself

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.410 
I think he was trying to freeze himself
on<00:01:56.259> purpose<00:01:56.469> I<00:01:57.310> don't<00:01:57.850> know<00:01:57.939> I've<00:01:58.090> done<00:01:58.270> that

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
around in the first two rounds but it's

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.429 
around in the first two rounds but it's
like<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.539> know<00:02:01.659> whatever<00:02:02.049> what<00:02:02.289> are<00:02:02.380> you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
lose on 100 bucks or so and you know

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.960 
lose on 100 bucks or so and you know
call<00:02:07.899> duty<00:02:08.110> money<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:08.560> what<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.729> really

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
call duty money but what is it really

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.720 
call duty money but what is it really
worth<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.539> don't<00:02:10.750> think<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.490> but<00:02:12.490> anyways

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
worth it I don't think so but anyways

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.760 
worth it I don't think so but anyways
you<00:02:12.880> get<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> person<00:02:13.300> other<00:02:13.570> money<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.530> I'm

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
you get the person other money but I'm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.440 
you get the person other money but I'm
just<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.730> show<00:02:15.940> you<00:02:16.000> guys<00:02:16.090> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
just you know going to show you guys I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.560 
just you know going to show you guys I
think<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.780> first<00:02:16.990> four<00:02:17.530> rounds<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:19.360> game

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
think the first four rounds of this game

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.030 
think the first four rounds of this game
that<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.870> played<00:02:20.110> old<00:02:20.500> times<00:02:20.920> two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
that we played old times two

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.339 
that we played old times two
so<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:23.090> far<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.689> first<00:02:23.900> three<00:02:24.170> rounds

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
so so far in the first three rounds

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.649 
so so far in the first three rounds
we've<00:02:24.709> gotten<00:02:25.040> three<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> there<00:02:26.299> we<00:02:26.390> go<00:02:26.420> we

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
we've gotten three and there we go we

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.300 
we've gotten three and there we go we
got<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> nuke<00:02:27.049> so<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:27.439> four<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.129> first

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
got a nuke so that's four in the first

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.539 
got a nuke so that's four in the first
three<00:02:28.519> rounds<00:02:28.670> which<00:02:29.920> doesn't<00:02:30.920> happen<00:02:31.280> that

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
three rounds which doesn't happen that

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.679 
three rounds which doesn't happen that
often<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:33.879> incall<00:02:34.879> today<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.180> don't<00:02:35.510> think

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
often in the incall today I don't think

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.289 
often in the incall today I don't think
so<00:02:35.870> most<00:02:36.409> of<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> games<00:02:36.829> I<00:02:37.010> played<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.579> know<00:02:38.269> I

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
so most of the games I played you know I

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.619 
so most of the games I played you know I
get<00:02:38.720> lucky<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.290> get<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.530> maximum<00:02:39.939> max<00:02:40.939> ammo<00:02:41.390> in

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
get lucky to get a maximum max ammo in

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.009 
get lucky to get a maximum max ammo in
the<00:02:41.810> first<00:02:42.049> five<00:02:42.890> rounds<00:02:43.189> or<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.670> because<00:02:44.359> you

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
the first five rounds or so because you

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.390 
the first five rounds or so because you
know<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.290> doesn't<00:02:45.500> really<00:02:45.739> happen<00:02:45.980> that<00:02:46.159> much

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
know it doesn't really happen that much

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.250 
know it doesn't really happen that much
I<00:02:46.700> don't<00:02:46.849> know<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:47.329> little<00:02:47.599> glitch<00:02:47.959> is<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
I don't know if this little glitch is a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.920 
I don't know if this little glitch is a
hundred<00:02:48.889> percent<00:02:49.010> proof<00:02:49.579> or<00:02:49.939> whatever<00:02:50.299> but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930

going to go got it takes so much time to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.780 
going to go got it takes so much time to
sit<00:03:11.480> through<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:11.989> go<00:03:12.109> through<00:03:12.349> like<00:03:12.530> 20<00:03:13.010> 30

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
sit through and go through like 20 30

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.819 
sit through and go through like 20 30
games<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.659> seeing<00:03:14.959> this<00:03:15.230> actually<00:03:15.439> work

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
games you know seeing this actually work

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.379 
games you know seeing this actually work
you<00:03:16.069> know<00:03:16.189> up<00:03:16.340> until<00:03:16.459> around<00:03:16.700> ten<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.299> would

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
you know up until around ten that would

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.349 
you know up until around ten that would
take<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:18.019> much<00:03:18.409> time<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.819> think<00:03:20.209> it'd<00:03:20.329> be

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
take so much time and I think it'd be

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.110 
take so much time and I think it'd be
nice<00:03:20.569> for<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:20.870> guys<00:03:20.900> here<00:03:21.169> to<00:03:21.290> try<00:03:21.470> this<00:03:21.500> out
