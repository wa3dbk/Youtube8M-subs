like now as you guys know battlefield is
normally<00:01:54.909> release<00:01:55.149> right<00:01:55.569> around<00:01:55.869> time<00:01:56.259> cod

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
normally release right around time cod

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
normally release right around time cod
is<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:57.009> instead<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:57.939> battlefield<00:01:58.359> game

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
is and instead of a battlefield game

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.870 
is and instead of a battlefield game
it's<00:01:59.139> all<00:01:59.469> gonna<00:01:59.679> be<00:01:59.770> Battlefront<00:02:00.459> this<00:02:00.609> year

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's all gonna be Battlefront this year

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.510 
it's all gonna be Battlefront this year
and<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.749> really<00:02:02.079> think<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.409> that<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.829> really<00:02:03.490> a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
and I really think that that is really a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.629 
and I really think that that is really a
big<00:02:04.029> big<00:02:04.389> problem<00:02:04.719> now<00:02:05.469> hardline<00:02:06.099> came<00:02:06.369> out<00:02:06.520> in

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
big big problem now hardline came out in

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.520 
big big problem now hardline came out in
March<00:02:06.939> which<00:02:07.389> was<00:02:07.599> really<00:02:07.959> really<00:02:08.349> great

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
March which was really really great

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.589 
March which was really really great
because<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:08.950> gave<00:02:09.190> us<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.490> break<00:02:09.729> from<00:02:10.240> advanced

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
because it gave us a break from advanced

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.570 
because it gave us a break from advanced
warfare<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.650> was<00:02:11.740> a<00:02:11.770> good<00:02:12.010> time<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.310> get

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
warfare and it was a good time to get

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.490 
warfare and it was a good time to get
released<00:02:12.940> because<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.480> could<00:02:13.660> play<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> if<00:02:14.230> we

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
released because we could play it if we

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.130 
released because we could play it if we
wanted<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.160> we<00:02:15.220> would<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.630> bit<00:02:16.870> sick

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
wanted and we would be a little bit sick

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.900 
wanted and we would be a little bit sick
of<00:02:17.260> advanced<00:02:17.560> warfare<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.340> thing<00:02:18.520> about<00:02:18.550> this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
of advanced warfare the thing about this

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.759 
of advanced warfare the thing about this
guys<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.630> don't<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:19.900> as<00:02:20.230> many<00:02:20.439> people

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
guys is I don't think as many people

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.619 
guys is I don't think as many people
aren't<00:02:20.890> gonna<00:02:21.250> end<00:02:21.519> up<00:02:21.640> getting<00:02:22.000> battlefront

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
aren't gonna end up getting battlefront

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.160 
aren't gonna end up getting battlefront
as<00:02:22.829> normally<00:02:23.829> would

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
as normally would

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
as normally would
it<00:02:24.290> would<00:02:24.560> be<00:02:24.770> released<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.280> March<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.790> think

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
it would be released in March I think

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.790 
it would be released in March I think
that's<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.240> little<00:02:26.510> bit<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.140> problem<00:02:27.440> in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
that's a little bit of a problem in

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.680 
that's a little bit of a problem in
marketing<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:28.550> they've<00:02:28.940> been<00:02:29.090> doing<00:02:29.360> every

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
marketing but they've been doing every

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.300 
marketing but they've been doing every
single<00:02:30.020> year<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.410> they're<00:02:30.500> honestly<00:02:31.010> losing

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
single year and they're honestly losing

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.880
