 match with the box you can hang 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.070
 somewhere on the wall for beauty and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.740
 use as an example for color your 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:25.569
 beautiful models and we see here 8 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 identical sprues perfectly 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.369
 identical sprues here such here 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:42.650
 here and start watching them here with us 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.460
 five carcasses are very good quality 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.450
 made here is how you see the warriors here 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.330
 without armor 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.660
 without mail without all that is about 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.150
 ordinary peasants that is like immediately 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.640
 what i want to tell you is this set 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.410
 fit almost all factions 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.220
 dark ages and under the vikings and grew up 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.990
 and according to the data and under the Anglo-Saxons under all 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.100
 under all these are just ordinary peasants 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.510
 which was torn away from the plow and now they came out 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.550
 in the open field to fight the foe 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.060
 so livestock we mean let's 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.130
 see how much we have here 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.270
 7 heads 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.400
 to a sufficiently large variation in 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.350
 get us but pay attention 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.160
 here on this head i'm here with my finger 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.730
 showing yes very strange because 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 this head is in the viking set 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.880
 herman of command sprue 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.860
 chieftain 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.380
 that is, she is there in a single 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.019
 copy here is their actual 8 as 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.320
 understand yes that is the head of king 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.920
 duel pida or moved here in this 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.090
 set and planned let's say poses 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.209
 enough such we can well say 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.070
 dynamic though without any frills then 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.590
 there is nobody here many raise no 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.390
 jumps well, the usual pose that is 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.470
 calculated for the game so that the soldier does not 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.030
 broke during your battles let's 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.640
 let's go to the arms that we see here 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.130
 prashchi that is important yes that is how would 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.600
 can make sopers that most 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.000
 coming up to these guys 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.640
 axes traditional weapons peasants 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.900
 need strange 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:44.030
 there is a hand with a ball swords then such here 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.130
 the peasants did not use much because 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 which did not know how to deal with them especially 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.070
 but, no less, there is a sword; 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.850
 give in the hands of some let's say so 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:04:00.680
 to the leader 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:01.670
 to our leader, this is a detachment, what else 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.980
 we see here 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.170
 rock we see here yes that is how would 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.350
 you can put next to the leader 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.670
 some baker who will be in 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.030
 rock of all stuns spears in big 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.450
 the numbers are represented and the darts that in 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.110
 historical enough copy 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.060
 thick enough nikita there is no such 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.120
 Here are the probabilities that somehow this is all 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.490
 will break with us when playing in contrast 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.260
 for example from a set of war games factory 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:41.270
 they also have a set like this 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.310
 period here but there it is very thin and the weapon in 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.550
 tom is still visible shields and of course we see 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.930
 which can be beautifully colored like that 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:56.150
 here so make ladies here and so 8 years old 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:59.330
 40 figures you can make guys with other 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.640
 can be done with spears with axes then 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.510
 there is such a typical peasantry in 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.940
 dark ages 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:11.870
 we get yes now what am I 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.419
 didn't like this set in this 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.930
 I really did not like this set 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.020
 here are the coasters before weird enough 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.870
 shipments with us because well what I want 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.100
 say fasten bist 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.460
 that is, this set is positioned under 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:37.130
 the game of saga here as we see the individual 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:40.190
 supplies total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.360
 15 16 times the rest of the supply with us 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.330
 either group square that is like 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.720
 so probably calculated for another six 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.520
 man on a 3-seater 2 that is how 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.440
 then it is very strange that is in the saga 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.590
 I think so does not go yes that is there 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.630
 want individual figurine that is 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.570
 I want to say what kind of huvs jarl 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.700
 in general, that is, as if this here 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.580
 here it is invested here is happiness here 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:12.010
 hobby bunker there are supplies and round and 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.050
 square and oval for any for your 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.970
 that is, desires can be purchased and 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.750
 put these guys ok 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.400
 wonderful for such a good supply 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.730
 but that's something that's all I want you 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.870
 say about this set more here 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:31.940
 say actually nothing fits 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.200
 any frags summarizing the conversation again 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:39.130
 I want to say guys without armor 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:43.340
 that is, the perfect set to start the game 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:47.420
 a great saga game that is practically 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:50.750
 buy you get 40 pieces for 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:54.070
 small quite money with this 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.570
 set pre it from dyeing 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.620
 because you can not even paint 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:03.380
 go out to beat the adversary thanks for that 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.680
 watched me put huskies 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:10.750
 come play hobby hopper on this 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.750
