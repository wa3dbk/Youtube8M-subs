00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:11.509
 so we celebrate 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.670
 after a successful hour 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.330
 herings angela so that's it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.590
 really really worth it and me 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.570
 think that will follow later 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.099
 twice worthwhile if the herring 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 again except flag come so completely 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 entertaining angel here great one 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.859
 hour fished the basket is full 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 That's why we can not do it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.910
 drive back to port in the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.230
 Port of Apple 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:45.020
 Here it goes out 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020
 We get the boats from Barriers Horn 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.870
 fishing for herring for many 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.870
 actually a spring all live 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.489
 yes we are on Baltic it is so that we 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 even now we have now mid-october 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 and we're just starting right now 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.320
 fantastic he inge calling in october 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.740
 the herring get that big very 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.259
 finished and also very good taste 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.720
 that goes into december and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.470
 if in the spring or come back the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.470
 next years 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.600
 a true coastal connoisseur is also 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.420
 manually grown up here above 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.350
 if possible every free minute for what 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.370
 really big things there for friedrich 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.710
 Just got from two feet to seventy 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.180
 route so weight 20 to 70 grams 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.420
 when the four thousand roll men 0 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.400
 14 plaited normal harings 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.010
 in front of a fold and a herringbrÃ¶tchen 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.960
 filker so if the man is there 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.690
 that one also with war 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.970
 mai in heringsdorf 8 is not equal to 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.830
 herings in front of the subject very noticeable 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.750
 this system with a pretty big one 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.209
 green fish are the fish today 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.420
 not at all on this something 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.060
 filigree variant, however, already on 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.930
 best you have to test so several 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.420
 this is really a fanatic thing 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 really great herring landed here the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.860
 Echolot is really full of fish and 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.319
 the paternosters are usually 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.959
 exactly how it should be 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:37.459
 great autumn with three wind strengths 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:42.140
 pleasant temperatures of 15 degrees all over 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.010
 very entertaining story and quite 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.010
 really great fish 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.920
 yes, I would say I'm doing what 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.500
 the fish now have something on 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
 in the spring, on the other hand 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
 the easy business is noticeable 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.280
 that is also a strenuous thing 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 for the fish under by longleit 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.530
 Office you are a lean eat in 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.750
 eat the result 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.590
 the fat content bring the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.420
 both donate 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.550
 before the fish, though 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.530
 they have to be taken care of 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.780
 Let's break it up again and again 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.760
 dozens, of course, just in such a way 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:31.910
 drama and then sat in the winter and winter 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:33.460
 then you can look on your own 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.690
 also just take out here 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:43.340
 just here long side here 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:50.650
 down to the front then up 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:53.439
 then just cut one 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.209
 you can pull away on the black skin 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.010
 everything with outside is faster 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.950
 It can not be simpler and easier 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.739
 nothing is cleaner 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.340
 At the end of our herings tour you 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.340
