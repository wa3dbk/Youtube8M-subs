00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
end up needing two frames I'm actually

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.560 
end up needing two frames I'm actually
going<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.370> use<00:02:58.520> half<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.810> frame<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:02.209> go<00:03:02.390> on

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
going to use half of this frame to go on

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.170 
going to use half of this frame to go on
the<00:03:02.660> black<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:04.160> do<00:03:04.670> some<00:03:04.910> moves

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the black one out there to do some moves

the black one out there to do some moves
and<00:03:05.450> everything<00:03:05.840> because<00:03:06.080> I'm<00:03:06.200> going<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> be

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and everything because I'm going to be

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.510 
and everything because I'm going to be
making<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:07.040> about<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.959> foot<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.230> foot<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.490> half

making it about a foot a foot and a half

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.699 
making it about a foot a foot and a half
longer<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.240> actually<00:03:11.450> won't<00:03:12.320> be<00:03:12.410> using<00:03:12.560> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
longer so I actually won't be using the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.490 
longer so I actually won't be using the
whole<00:03:12.890> frame<00:03:13.190> I'll<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.910> using<00:03:14.500> eighteen

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
whole frame I'll be using eighteen

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.420 
whole frame I'll be using eighteen
inches<00:03:15.860> probably<00:03:16.209> from<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.510> one<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.440> go<00:03:18.920> onto

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
inches probably from this one to go onto

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.420 
inches probably from this one to go onto
the<00:03:20.000> black<00:03:20.209> one<00:03:20.239> outside<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.290> was<00:03:22.010> eyeballing

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
the black one outside I was eyeballing

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.810 
the black one outside I was eyeballing
this<00:03:22.790> one<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.600> will<00:03:23.780> be<00:03:23.810> fun<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.040> then<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.670> got

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
this one this will be fun and then I got

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.699 
this one this will be fun and then I got
thinking<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.450> only<00:03:26.720> real<00:03:27.019> thing<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.440> need<00:03:27.620> to

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
thinking the only real thing I need to

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.259 
thinking the only real thing I need to
do<00:03:27.830> I<00:03:27.860> need<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.160> rebuild<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.550> carburetor<00:03:28.820> on

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
do I need to rebuild the carburetor on

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.880 
do I need to rebuild the carburetor on
this<00:03:29.450> one<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.720> put<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> new<00:03:30.019> cord<00:03:30.320> on<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.530> so

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
this one and put a new cord on it so

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.590 
this one and put a new cord on it so
I'll<00:03:31.040> probably<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:31.970> for<00:03:32.420> right<00:03:32.570> now

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
I'll probably just do that for right now

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.120 
I'll probably just do that for right now
and<00:03:32.989> play<00:03:33.140> with<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.620> go<00:03:33.769> ahead<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:33.980> get<00:03:34.070> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
and play with it and go ahead and get it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.750 
and play with it and go ahead and get it
painted<00:03:34.340> up<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.950> run<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.100> motor<00:03:37.400> till<00:03:37.640> it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
painted up and run that motor till it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.699 
painted up and run that motor till it
close<00:03:38.030> but<00:03:38.630> let's<00:03:39.019> go<00:03:39.140> out<00:03:39.170> here<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.470> take<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
close but let's go out here and take a

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.910 
close but let's go out here and take a
look<00:03:39.860> at<00:03:40.010> this

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.910 

the<00:03:43.400> other<00:03:43.610> half<00:03:44.030> of<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:46.900> now<00:03:50.650> okay<00:03:51.650> that's

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
the other half of this now okay that's

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.300 
the other half of this now okay that's
the<00:03:52.100> side<00:03:52.310> now<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.240> is<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.540> one<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:55.160> we're

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
the side now this is the one that we're

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.210 
the side now this is the one that we're
going<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:55.610> be<00:03:55.760> using<00:03:56.180> mainly<00:03:57.010> we're<00:03:58.010> going<00:03:58.160> to

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
going to be using mainly we're going to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.220 
going to be using mainly we're going to
be<00:03:58.280> using<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:58.670> transmission<00:03:59.480> off<00:03:59.720> of<00:04:00.080> this

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
be using the transmission off of this

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.570 
be using the transmission off of this
guy<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:02.830> we'll<00:04:03.830> be<00:04:03.980> using<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.310> complete

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
guy and we'll be using the complete

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.420 
guy and we'll be using the complete
frame<00:04:05.000> from<00:04:05.330> this<00:04:05.510> one<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:05.840> well<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:07.370> don't

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
frame from this one as well and I don't

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.520 
frame from this one as well and I don't
know<00:04:07.760> I'll<00:04:08.030> probably<00:04:08.210> whoever<00:04:08.990> has<00:04:09.380> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
know I'll probably whoever has the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.040 
know I'll probably whoever has the
better<00:04:09.740> front<00:04:10.430> end<00:04:10.610> assembly<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.840> has<00:04:11.930> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
better front end assembly that has the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.760 
better front end assembly that has the
least<00:04:12.200> amount<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.530> wear<00:04:12.710> I'll<00:04:12.860> use<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.430> and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
least amount of wear I'll use it and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.729 
least amount of wear I'll use it and
then<00:04:15.770> we<00:04:15.800> will<00:04:18.130> imagine<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.430> will<00:04:20.680> at<00:04:21.680> that

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
then we will imagine if you will at that

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.030 
then we will imagine if you will at that
motor<00:04:22.930> it's<00:04:23.930> going<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.170> be<00:04:24.230> in<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.380> back<00:04:24.590> about

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
motor it's going to be in the back about

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.980 
motor it's going to be in the back about
eight<00:04:25.430> inches<00:04:25.880> from<00:04:26.420> the<00:04:26.540> pulley<00:04:26.780> you're

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
eight inches from the pulley you're

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.110 
eight inches from the pulley you're
going<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.170> have<00:04:27.260> a<00:04:27.290> short<00:04:27.590> belt<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.730> connects

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
going to have a short belt that connects

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.270 
going to have a short belt that connects
the<00:04:29.750> pulley<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.650> drive<00:04:31.010> with<00:04:31.220> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
the pulley to the drive with the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.240 
the pulley to the drive with the
tensioner<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.750> have<00:04:32.870> these<00:04:33.110> belts<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:34.070> will

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
tensioner and have these belts you will

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.380 
tensioner and have these belts you will
sit<00:04:35.380> along<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.560> frame<00:04:36.920> on<00:04:37.160> top<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.000> I'm

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
sit along the frame on top of it and I'm

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.770 
sit along the frame on top of it and I'm
going<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.750> widen<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.830> frame<00:04:40.100> out<00:04:40.390> as<00:04:41.390> well

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
going to widen the frame out as well

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.160 
going to widen the frame out as well
with<00:04:42.050> some<00:04:43.150> angle<00:04:44.150> iron<00:04:44.300> or<00:04:44.660> perhaps<00:04:44.840> some

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
with some angle iron or perhaps some

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.100 
with some angle iron or perhaps some
channel<00:04:45.560> from<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.920> other<00:04:46.070> red<00:04:46.840> wide-body<00:04:47.840> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
channel from the other red wide-body and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.460 
channel from the other red wide-body and
it<00:04:48.770> will<00:04:48.950> be<00:04:49.130> about<00:04:49.610> a<00:04:50.410> foot<00:04:52.300> longer<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:54.440> that

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
it will be about a foot longer so that

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.640 
it will be about a foot longer so that
is<00:04:55.280> what<00:04:55.669> I'm<00:04:55.760> thinking<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.450> doing<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.560> of

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
is what I'm thinking of doing and of

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.380 
is what I'm thinking of doing and of
course<00:04:57.860> we'll<00:04:58.040> have<00:04:58.070> these<00:04:58.340> tires<00:04:58.640> on<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.880> and

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
course we'll have these tires on it and

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
example of how we're looking to do it

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.930 
example of how we're looking to do it
this<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.330> plate<00:06:18.600> that<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.740> motor<00:06:20.010> mounts

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
this is the plate that the motor mounts

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.570 
this is the plate that the motor mounts
on<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.650> that<00:06:22.650> is<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.040> level<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.490> the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
on and that is the level of the

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.330 
on and that is the level of the
transmission<00:06:24.390> and<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.230> channel<00:06:25.650> lock<00:06:25.890> will

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
transmission and the channel lock will

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.120 
transmission and the channel lock will
actually<00:06:26.940> about<00:06:27.090> right<00:06:27.330> there<00:06:27.570> so<00:06:28.500> what<00:06:28.770> I'm

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
actually about right there so what I'm

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.200 
actually about right there so what I'm
looking<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.970> do<00:06:30.150> is<00:06:31.580> welding<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:32.670> extending

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
the channel the C channel out to this

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.490 
the channel the C channel out to this
point<00:06:38.010> and<00:06:38.750> we're<00:06:39.750> going<00:06:39.870> to<00:06:39.960> mount<00:06:40.169> the<00:06:40.320> motor

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
point and we're going to mount the motor

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.560 
point and we're going to mount the motor
here<00:06:41.160> and<00:06:42.530> we'll<00:06:43.530> run<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:43.890> short<00:06:44.190> belt<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:45.450> the
