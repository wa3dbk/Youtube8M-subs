no<00:04:20.370> threat<00:04:20.820> or<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.780> don't<00:04:22.259> know<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.099> that's<00:04:23.550> a

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
no threat or I don't know so that's a

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.430 
no threat or I don't know so that's a
bit<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:23.880> a<00:04:24.060> non<00:04:24.360> nouns<00:04:24.630> really<00:04:25.020> I'm<00:04:25.139> gonna<00:04:25.320> give

at<00:04:25.530> once<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.830> t54<00:04:26.520> though<00:04:26.699> because<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.660> think

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
at once the t54 though because I think

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.310 
at once the t54 though because I think
it<00:04:30.000> got<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.360> shot<00:04:30.599> off<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.960> damaged<00:04:31.289> the

let's do it fight making on surrounds
round<00:04:44.820> four<00:04:45.570> there<00:04:46.380> we<00:04:46.470> go<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.660> again<00:04:48.960> this<00:04:49.620> is

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
round four there we go so again this is

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
a fight for survival and c-54s

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.719 
a fight for survival and c-54s
perspective<00:04:52.349> it's<00:04:52.830> been<00:04:52.979> hit<00:04:53.220> straight<00:04:53.490> away

pampers gonna sneak forward hopefully we

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.189 
pampers gonna sneak forward hopefully we
might<00:05:05.280> see<00:05:05.490> repeat<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.909> last<00:05:05.940> battle<00:05:06.539> Dai

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199

glitching

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.469 

so<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.770> see<00:05:21.009> if<00:05:21.099> it<00:05:21.220> will<00:05:21.460> prove<00:05:21.759> repaired<00:05:22.270> it

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
so I see if it will prove repaired it

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.939 
so I see if it will prove repaired it
