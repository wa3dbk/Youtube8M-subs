00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.609
 then very briefly results it's a 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.589
 group of three composers 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.170
 departure to write the songs and we 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.019
 is particularly interested in the universe 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.790
 of the family with all that it is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 amusing 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.949
 then good by putting that with music 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 current 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 because these musics of today that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.689
 the kids know how to catch 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 why a christmas album 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.779
 but in fact we thought why not 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 had we never discussed this 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 kind of theme and what kind of songs 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.840
 so we do covers and songs 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.719
 in the sauce 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.399
 and then how interested in the universe 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.350
 of the family there is some logic 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 to be interested in the biggest party 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 family that is Christmas 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
 so we said we're good and then leave to 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.730
 do it and we're damned 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.360
 the idea is that it's a moment a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 a little bit tonic too in the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 evening which does not stop young people 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.469
 people next door but it's still 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 zouk festive and me here but warm 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.949
 whose great chance of having had clarika 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 who is a friend we know long 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.150
 date she had already participated in our 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 album on may is there when we had the idea 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.880
 to take the daughter of Santa Claus on 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.560
 can say the playfulness 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.299
 of the character him sheet metal altogether and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 not that we invite to share their 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.100
