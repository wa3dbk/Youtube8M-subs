time trial the world's your tongue it

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.330 
time trial the world's your tongue it
was<00:02:21.780> only<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.290> Grand<00:02:22.560> Tour<00:02:22.800> stages

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
was only about this Grand Tour stages

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.860 
was only about this Grand Tour stages
we're<00:02:23.550> missing<00:02:23.880> something<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:24.720> like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
we're missing something so that was like

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.380 
we're missing something so that was like
why<00:02:25.140> why<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.380> was<00:02:25.590> brought<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.190> had

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
why why I was brought in but we had

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.490 
why why I was brought in but we had
everything<00:02:27.390> around<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> able<00:02:28.320> to

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
everything around that to be able to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400 
everything around that to be able to
work<00:02:28.709> anyway<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.459> think<00:02:29.959> yeah<00:02:30.959> it's<00:02:31.110> took<00:02:31.290> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
work anyway so I think yeah it's took a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.110 
work anyway so I think yeah it's took a
year<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> kind<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.040> revolve<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.950> think

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
year to kind of revolve and I think

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.060 
year to kind of revolve and I think
there's<00:02:36.120> not<00:02:36.209> much<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:37.079> can<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.500> really

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
there's not much we can really really

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's not much we can really really
manage<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.760> structure<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.480> should

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
manage and structure to do it should

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:47.950 
manage and structure to do it should
just<00:02:39.750> fall<00:02:39.959> into<00:02:40.140> place<00:02:40.260> hopefully

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.710 

in<00:02:48.770> a<00:02:48.920> spring<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.880> hardest<00:02:50.270> thing<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.540> thing

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
in a spring the hardest thing the thing

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.780 
in a spring the hardest thing the thing
that<00:02:50.870> drains<00:02:51.110> most<00:02:51.410> energy<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.280> not<00:02:52.370> it's

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
that drains most energy it's not it's

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.640 
that drains most energy it's not it's
not<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.090> pushing<00:02:53.570> it's<00:02:53.840> not<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.140> moving<00:02:54.500> off

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
not the pushing it's not the moving off

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.000 
not the pushing it's not the moving off
it<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.330> even<00:02:56.480> though<00:02:56.780> like<00:02:57.080> 600<00:02:57.860> watts

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
it it's not even though like 600 watts

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.350 
it it's not even though like 600 watts
we<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.370> do<00:02:58.460> for<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.760> kilometers<00:02:59.180> before

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
we have to do for the kilometers before

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.000 
we have to do for the kilometers before
the<00:02:59.600> spring<00:02:59.780> it's<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.050> mental<00:03:00.440> stress<00:03:00.770> that's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the spring it's a mental stress that's

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.680 
the spring it's a mental stress that's
what<00:03:01.160> drain<00:03:01.460> do<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.790> know<00:03:01.910> how<00:03:02.090> many<00:03:02.150> think<00:03:02.540> I

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
what drain do you know how many think I

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.810 
what drain do you know how many think I
would<00:03:02.870> think<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:03.290> quickly<00:03:03.770> having<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.400> think<00:03:04.610> so

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
would think so quickly having a think so

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.300 
would think so quickly having a think so
quickly<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.040> almost

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
quickly that it it it is almost

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.520 
quickly that it it it is almost
instinctively<00:03:08.030> it's<00:03:08.540> borderline<00:03:09.050> on

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
instinctively it's borderline on

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.010 
instinctively it's borderline on
instinct<00:03:10.460> you<00:03:10.730> know<00:03:10.850> we<00:03:11.300> have<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.720> think<00:03:11.960> you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
instinct you know we have to think you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.570 
instinct you know we have to think you
have<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.320> realize<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.800> consequences<00:03:12.950> of

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
have to realize the consequences of

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400 
have to realize the consequences of
every<00:03:13.940> move<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.270> have<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.510> make<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:15.140> probably

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
every move you have to make you probably

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.930 
every move you have to make you probably
have<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> make<00:03:15.770> four<00:03:16.070> or<00:03:16.130> five<00:03:16.310> moves<00:03:16.610> within<00:03:16.850> a

couple<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.270> seconds<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.810> know<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:19.600> that

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
couple of seconds you know and that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.780 
couple of seconds you know and that
really<00:03:20.810> does<00:03:21.080> draney<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.740> obviously<00:03:22.550> we<00:03:22.700> have

really does draney and obviously we have

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.030 
really does draney and obviously we have
to<00:03:22.940> put<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.510> amount<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.110> how<00:03:24.290> we<00:03:24.350> put<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.830> for

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
to put the amount of how we put out for

to put the amount of how we put out for
the<00:03:25.100> last<00:03:25.250> 2<00:03:25.490> 300<00:03:25.970> meters<00:03:26.300> so<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.540> be<00:03:26.750> able<00:03:26.780> to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
the last 2 300 meters so to be able to

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.600 
the last 2 300 meters so to be able to
keep<00:03:27.080> as<00:03:27.230> much<00:03:27.350> energy<00:03:27.620> as<00:03:27.830> possible<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.460> that

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
keep as much energy as possible for that

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.130 
keep as much energy as possible for that
it's<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.820> most<00:03:29.000> important<00:03:29.480> thing<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.900> there

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
it's the most important thing and there

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.980 
it's the most important thing and there
what<00:03:31.010> Mark<00:03:31.280> does<00:03:31.460> he<00:03:31.610> thinks<00:03:32.390> for<00:03:32.540> me<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.960> know

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
what Mark does he thinks for me you know

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.050 
what Mark does he thinks for me you know
I<00:03:33.320> trust<00:03:33.770> him<00:03:33.980> it's<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.730> same<00:03:34.940> with

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
I trust him it's the same with

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.730 
I trust him it's the same with
alessandra<00:03:35.690> I<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:35.960> either<00:03:36.200> one<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.620> in

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
alessandra I think either one is in

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.800 
alessandra I think either one is in
front<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.040> me<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.160> trust<00:03:37.670> their<00:03:37.970> instinct<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.600> my

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
front of me I trust their instinct of my

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.720 
front of me I trust their instinct of my
own<00:03:38.960> you<00:03:39.170> know<00:03:39.590> where<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.250> past<00:03:40.490> or

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
own you know where is in the past or

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.190 
own you know where is in the past or
with<00:03:40.880> other<00:03:41.060> people<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.480> may<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.930> have<00:03:42.050> to

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
with other people you may we have to

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.800 
with other people you may we have to
look<00:03:42.440> what<00:03:42.650> you're<00:03:42.770> doing<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:43.130> maybe<00:03:43.810> don't

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
look what you're doing you maybe don't

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.810 
look what you're doing you maybe don't
think<00:03:45.410> they'll<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.920> there<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.640> know<00:03:46.760> you

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
think they'll get you there you know you

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.270 
think they'll get you there you know you
look<00:03:47.060> for<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.480> other<00:03:47.840> ways<00:03:48.170> with<00:03:48.530> these<00:03:48.800> two<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
look for the other ways with these two I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.030 
look for the other ways with these two I
take<00:03:49.880> their<00:03:50.350> decision<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.470> my<00:03:51.680> own<00:03:51.830> you<00:03:51.860> know

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
take their decision of my own you know

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.560 
take their decision of my own you know
so<00:03:52.340> technically<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.180> look<00:03:53.330> at<00:03:53.450> the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
so technically I can just look at the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.970 
so technically I can just look at the
back<00:03:53.780> wheel<00:03:53.990> I<00:03:54.020> know<00:03:54.200> they'll<00:03:54.500> deliver<00:03:54.680> me<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
back wheel I know they'll deliver me to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.310 
back wheel I know they'll deliver me to
the<00:03:55.010> right<00:03:55.190> position<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.790> know<00:03:55.970> 99<00:03:56.750> times<00:03:57.140> out

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
the right position you know 99 times out

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.590 
the right position you know 99 times out
100<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.010> there<00:03:58.190> that's<00:03:58.970> a<00:03:59.120> comfortable

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
100 and there that's a comfortable

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.350 
100 and there that's a comfortable
position<00:03:59.690> to<00:04:00.080> be<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:01.610> makes<00:04:01.850> my<00:04:02.090> job

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
position to be in and it it makes my job

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.740 
position to be in and it it makes my job
easier<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.350> gives<00:04:03.560> me<00:04:03.710> more<00:04:04.750> well

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
easier and it gives me more well

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.390 
easier and it gives me more well
therefore<00:04:06.020> given<00:04:06.560> me<00:04:06.620> more<00:04:06.770> power<00:04:06.830> at<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.280> end

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
therefore given me more power at the end

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
therefore given me more power at the end
for<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.640> final<00:04:07.940> sprint<00:04:08.180> sir

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.699 

the<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.769> dynamics<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.489> cycling<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.709> means

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
the the dynamics of cycling that means

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.620 
the the dynamics of cycling that means
that<00:04:19.950> no<00:04:20.190> sprint<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.850> ever<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.209> same<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.600> know

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that no sprint is ever the same you know

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.120 
that no sprint is ever the same you know
the<00:04:21.810> grading<00:04:22.230> of<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.470> road<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.919> wind

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
the grading of the road the wind

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.430 
the grading of the road the wind
direction<00:04:23.450> how<00:04:24.450> hard<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.930> race<00:04:25.080> has<00:04:25.290> been

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
direction how hard the race has been

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.400 
direction how hard the race has been
before<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:27.030> competitors<00:04:27.360> around<00:04:27.960> you

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
before and the competitors around you

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.440 
before and the competitors around you
know<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.830> every<00:04:29.430> sprint<00:04:29.700> is<00:04:29.820> different<00:04:30.270> but

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
know so every sprint is different but

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.300 
know so every sprint is different but
you<00:04:31.050> can<00:04:31.260> if<00:04:31.290> you're<00:04:31.560> probably<00:04:31.800> going<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.130> look

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
you can if you're probably going to look

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.070 
you can if you're probably going to look
between<00:04:32.490> 10<00:04:32.790> and<00:04:32.820> 15<00:04:33.030> seconds<00:04:33.690> for<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.870> last

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
between 10 and 15 seconds for the last

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.270 
between 10 and 15 seconds for the last
spring<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.650> can<00:04:34.770> be<00:04:34.800> anywhere<00:04:35.130> between

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
spring so that can be anywhere between

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.730 
spring so that can be anywhere between
150<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.150> 300<00:04:36.450> meters<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.110> being<00:04:37.320> Sprint's

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
150 and 300 meters is being Sprint's

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.070 
150 and 300 meters is being Sprint's
where<00:04:37.860> I've<00:04:37.950> gone<00:04:38.130> from<00:04:38.340> almost<00:04:38.460> almost<00:04:39.360> 500

where I've gone from almost almost 500

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.620

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
like 450 meters before us that's really

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.260 
like 450 meters before us that's really
long<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.200> warn<00:04:43.560> them<00:04:43.620> there's<00:04:44.280> also<00:04:44.430> also
