 how to mix live drums overview 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:12.120
 yes i am about her i will show you how let's 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.910
 let 's call it let's call this introduction 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.440
 to work with live drum for kids 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.990
 which in their practice are usually not 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 they all work with drums for those who 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.160
 works with electronic drums 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.080
 completely different stare 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.050
 I notice that in the course of our development in 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.390
 the information area about this we start 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 use many different 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.230
 elements and different genres people became 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.660
 give me live drums more often than this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.149
 I used to like you too 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.890
 stayed on the wave 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 usually when the live drums comes from 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.079
 you have tracks on top of small bottom 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:00.719
 small inside the barrel behind the installation 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.390
 many volumes of stereo and mono important you 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.090
 get yourself an item microphone recording and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.450
 this is what makes sound 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.720
 the drum is alive this sound is real 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.869
 it is he who is not your room 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.340
 the beauty that live drums give 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.960
 this is the reason why we are 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
 need to adjust reverb 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
 electronic drums so that a little 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 life on top of it is also quite 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 useful because they give high 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
 frequencies also like a high heat microphone 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.299
 rush i will start with the page to the main 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 concepts 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.680
 days flush because think of everyone 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 microphone as the most 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 optimized redeem all role for 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 of the castle which he wrote most 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.649
 sound engineers are well versed in this 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.899
 and they try to collect all possible 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.259
 formation with a microphone and what to get 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.259
 good sound on some overheads 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.450
 room microphones 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.079
 there may be some microphones 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.770
 blurring you extra at the sound and so 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.109
 Further 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.960
 on this track, I will highlight the hunger and microphone 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:21.870
 it should not be a word simpler 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:24.330
 setting a lot of good sound very 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.040
 great recorded now I want to get rid of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.830
 cardboard nasty castle not 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.170
 Compress and the reason why I 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.269
 I will compress is completed in that I 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.579
 I want to pull out 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.380
 reflections still surrender thereby sensations 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:49.560
 the fact that I did not register think 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:51.660
 bigger look here and so 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.180
 what we did floor home muted on 9 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.180
 tcl frequency 800 herzen in baby 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.600
 we raised a little three and a half 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.519
 kilohertz just a little bit and slightly 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.480
 raised the top frequencies so now i'm 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.870
 I'll remove the equalizer 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:18.630
 now let me show you what to do 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:30.180
 compresses and button is responsible for turning on 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:32.370
 i got used to end the full impact so 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.440
 think about it as in preparation we 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.250
 we cut off the excess we have it a little so 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.700
 say clear and so another source 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.079
 environments this is overheaddog we have left 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.319
 and right overhand 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.990
 and the approach to them in general seems we are not 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.880
 will spend 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:04:06.800
 at this time just look at that 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:04:09.860
 look at these plates afterwards 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.430
 that try to soften I will take the frequency of 5 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.110
 kHz 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.830
 and 300 hertz and remove them here, in principle, then 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.270
 the key is that there are drum sounds 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:28.730
 let's mine everything except the barrel 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:32.180
 small approach to a small lobe is the same 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.670
 as well as the usual drum I also have 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.470
 trigger and now i will show you an example 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:46.600
 just using that barrel as I got 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.600
 what I added is small 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.200
 we have kidney sounds little let's 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:17.150
 add to them and room let's see what 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:21.250
 will dry here's the top of the house 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.250
 rooms will give us energy for steam bangi 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:31.270
 foot greatness everything and in general i need 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.270
 a little more compression 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.000
 this changing the delay makes it more 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:55.020
 long remember dj flutter talked about 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.130
 that's all tom and me come to this 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.500
 spider sometimes I clean clean between 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.810
 four hundred and eight hundred leadership already 70 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.070
 just do not write add a little 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.590
 midrange attacks 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:19.290
 one and a half kilo hertz and I add a little 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:22.740
 the top what happens moaning without i 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.550
 add quite rooms to the microphone to 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.990
 this sound is an emulation princeton 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.770
 digital 2016 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.130
 Emperor we where he is healthy mage here 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.130
 without him 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:49.870
 but the blue pancakes like this in general and 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:52.210
 Overall, everything is just methodically Yamato Cancer we 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.009
 trying to make it work 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.220
 place and sometimes experiment with 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.460
 back phase on certain tracks 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:03.070
 it enhances you what effects this track 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:25.180
 there was a very good record here that's completely 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:28.960
 the drum track that's all 100 so this 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.509
 not very difficult so many frequencies that 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.110
 you want to work on the dirt between the three 

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:39.039
 and six of us 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:41.169
 8 Herzen with us, be careful 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:43.030
 adding not for you in general is not worth it 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.900
 add no white 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.580
 where you add 40 is 60 hertz. 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.610
 you can certainly depending on 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:55.780
 what drum do you have then 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.449
 get if you need to work on 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.449
 small I will not stop so 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.099
 as we talked a lot on this topic 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:05.949
 energy flower up and 2 bedroom 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:09.130
 microphone i hope this helps you 

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:11.849
 start it you are on the way of recording 

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.849
 new grind
