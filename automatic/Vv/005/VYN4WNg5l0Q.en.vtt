00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.459
 of 8 gb 7 gigas and a half is of forces of 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.119

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.639
 usb 2.0 of 16 gigabytes or on disk 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.680
 hard but the game disc when you already 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.769
 disc 2 says uncertain to play and the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 that you're going to always use that 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.750
 you have to install I repeat you do not have it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.040
 to install on your hard drive since you're going 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.660

 installed what not to do as you see 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.819
 it does not appear late does not appear this is going to 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.739
 reduce a bit the speed of the game and 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.840
 in the cinematic will see trace 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.329
