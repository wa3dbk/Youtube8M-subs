and six ring and back as well well

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.760 
and six ring and back as well well
instead<00:01:05.180> of<00:01:05.409> going<00:01:06.409> back<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.540> starting

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
instead of going back to the starting

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.620 
instead of going back to the starting
whatever<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.130> it<00:01:10.280> was<00:01:10.310> played<00:01:11.299> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
whatever the it was played the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:22.300 
whatever the it was played the
third<00:01:12.049> string<00:01:12.320> open<00:01:14.020> that's<00:01:15.250> Mike<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:22.009> guys

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
third string open that's Mike so guys

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.720 
third string open that's Mike so guys
like

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:39.539 

you

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.120 

so<00:01:40.549> then<00:01:40.789> you<00:01:40.909> go<00:01:41.000> back<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.799> start<00:01:42.799> pattern

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so then you go back to the start pattern

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.340 
so then you go back to the start pattern
again<00:01:43.340> though

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.260 

but<00:01:46.979> instead<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> ship<00:01:47.820> string

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
but instead of going to a ship string

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.899 
but instead of going to a ship string
3rd<00:01:48.930> fret<00:01:48.960> straight<00:01:49.439> away<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.549> play<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
3rd fret straight away you play the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.380 
3rd fret straight away you play the
fifth<00:01:51.150> string<00:01:51.450> open<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> play<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fifth string open and then you play the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.980 
fifth string open and then you play the
fourth<00:01:55.259> string<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> fourth<00:01:56.130> fret<00:01:56.990> then

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fourth string with the fourth fret then

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.710 
fourth string with the fourth fret then

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
and then fourth open as well so it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.529 
and then fourth open as well so it's
like

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.030 

then<00:02:11.019> you<00:02:11.140> get<00:02:11.290> out<00:02:11.409> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> six<00:02:11.829> string

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
then you get out of the six string

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.069 
then you get out of the six string
fourth<00:02:12.250> fret<00:02:15.420> let's<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.569> playing<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.840> third
