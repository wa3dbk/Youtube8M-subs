00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
which takes a little bit of the chill

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:47.279

because asphalt patching materials are

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.779 
because asphalt patching materials are
much<00:00:49.749> easier<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.350> use<00:00:50.499> when<00:00:51.309> they're<00:00:51.460> warm<00:00:51.670> and
