00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.970

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.890
 a bullet bag with surprise this is 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.380
 of cajeta in our fourth attempt in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 the first two attempts did not come out a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.019
 tom I'm showing you the keychain 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.510
 they are very father I liked the figure and 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:22.660
 in the past video did not come all 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.450
 But I liked it a lot 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.250
 but well, here are the ones that have 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.310
 come out we know that this time we 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.120
 come out someone else father let's open the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.220
 bag I show you quickly brings the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.100
 logo of the marvel habits of the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.230
 movie the era of a troll in those of 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.230
 cajeta and in the public 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.750
 shows that we have more explained 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.239
 I will mention that they are 8 keychains 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.050
 silver they are called silver they would win 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.350
 more silver is a gray color and 32 styles 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.359
 but effective I do not like them very well 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.960
 poor quality 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.960
 with his life 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.440
 because the captain touches america or something 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.440
 plus 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.370
 to those who believe that it touched me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'm going to teach you on the outside I'm not going 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.470
 to open because it's the third time that we 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.630
 leaves culture 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.960
 what yes since what I bring 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.960
 mystic is different is the number 31 and 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.550
 31 since we had left earlier 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 It was number 23 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.330
 as good friends will leave the key 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 here as part of the things that I think 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:54.960
 give these to subscribers of the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:58.620
 channel show how real and as I 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.090
 I think next week I'll buy one 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.190
 more to make a last attempt paying 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.050
 that we get a different one 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.650
 give him laical video and subscribe to the channel 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.650
