00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello everyone welcome to the channel as 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.480
 I arrive 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 this time we are to teach you things 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 basic about your car that can 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.560
 know that nothing else they handle him 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.070
 they throw gasoline of frills 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.369
 for example he does not get to mark the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.610
 little light of it from the oil as you know 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.340
 if we really lack 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.060
 as you might be failing this 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.280
 some good sensor to check like this is 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.739
 very easy to give us the oil remember the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.809
 motor oil if they have charge 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.330
 automatic motor oil is had 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.379
 to take cold because if you chat 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.260
 hot the oil goes up and can give us 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.400
 a false measure and the oil of the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.590
 transmission is that way they are giving 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.840
 but good to check the oil is very 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 easy nothing else caught 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 the lever 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.150
 Hello 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.820
 the meter for the oil I want to say and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.820
 they take it out they clean it 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.370
 and here they will see 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.470
 in case you notice there is a measure 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.780
 of minimum and maximum 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.140
 what we want is that it is between this 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.510
 line and this line that is not below 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 neither very close to this nor very low nor 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.210
 above this because if not what is going to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.210
 provoke is 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.159
 then we put it back 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.180
 we wait a few seconds 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.570
 we take it out 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.440
 and this is the measure of oil 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.980
 that we have lady I bring it perfect 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.980
 why 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.659
 also if the oil here the increase 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.129
 It is very black 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.129
 but black or black 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.600
 and that means that they need a 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.600
 oil change 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.819
 to check the same as the transmission 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.690
 is with this 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.000
 tea is wrong because that caught on 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.060
 chaos 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.940
 but just like studying how is it going to 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.410
 be many come like this or come with the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 measurer 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.700
 how do you greet Miss and like 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.150
 to be marked 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.150
 between the maximum and minimum lines 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.799
 what I say is fine 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.830
 it was good 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:33.250
 what's it called is going to say trans 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.250
 as usual 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.510
 the fight function 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.410
 now if you miss oil 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.360
 where you have to put it 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.700
 usually the covers always looked 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.700
 and says 29 but if the lid were 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.700
 graffiti 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.370
 and if you are painted like that, nothing else 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.010
 remember the engine is this 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.720
 and usually while the cover here is 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.200
 what is going to be the oil 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.030
 this oil stage is where it is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.030
 is where we have to deposit the oil 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.540
 these lakes so hard between waters and 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.950
 more is hot because it makes us 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.170
 pressure then there deposit the oil 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.970
 and what they measure them 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.970
 the measure that there has the 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.199
 as we know in the wand to measure 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.700
 but tonight because I am in part 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.020
 to meditate good 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:47.260
 well what will measure them in itself is more 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.180
 or less a liter then yes it does 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.550
 missing all that is missing a liter 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.500
 complete like this is up to the minimum if 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.009
 is in the middle when half a liter is missing and 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.729
 A) Yes 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:02.270
 this is what we have to do is that 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.580
 never be at the minimum 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.000
 neither down nor much less below that's what 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.540
 worst 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.730
 then the transmission fluid 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.030
 s alike will mark the ie 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:19.340
 transmission but likewise if it's not 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.340
 It is not painted well 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.400
 it's a deposit like this size 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.160
 and that nothing else 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.889
 and unclog it 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.230
 and here 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:40.100
 sba brand 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.540
 where they mark hot and cold by 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.660
 example right now it's cold then 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.110
 there marks me everything is perfectly that 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.110
 is what 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.449
 including the transmission that is for the 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.699
 steering wheel 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.600
 if they ever hear the sound of your steering wheel 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:02.680
 is that you need liquid 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.800
 transmission fluid in in that reservoir 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.069
 good and finally 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.720
 to check that they bring water and 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:16.889
 antifreeze in this deposit this 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.020
 deposit there will mark them full or that 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.449
 you have to add this as it collides 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.780
 because almost you do not see moves move in the 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.780
 car 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.640
 and there to know that we are a little liquid 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.849
 and they will see more or less to what extent 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.559
 is 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.470
 then here in the video I think that I do not know 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:39.300
 will notice but 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.300
 today or I measured it and it's fine 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.290
 but yes 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.290
 and good if you need water 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.780
 we have to clean the windshields 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.520
 Here also is the deposit you 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.090
 they fill with water and they can also throw 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.090
 A little of 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.689
 d 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.610
 like wind next so you clean them well 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.529
 or in any case they can also throw a 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.909
 little antifreeze combined with 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:17.319
 water so when it does when it's cold 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:22.110
 when they hit something like that with oily 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:22.110
 or something like that cleans it up a lot easier 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.280
 well I hope these tips will 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.280
 have served are basic things and has 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.280
 What to know about your car if it is not 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.680
 well then what good and if not good already 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.360
 he knows 

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.990
 you know if they like hand up 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.529
 share subscribe 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.279
 and then we see the borrowed videos 

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:47.279
 Thank you
