hey everyone so yesterday I learned that

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.120 
hey everyone so yesterday I learned that
Americans<00:00:03.810> don't<00:00:04.110> drink<00:00:04.350> their<00:00:04.529> milk<00:00:04.560> out<00:00:04.950> of

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
Americans don't drink their milk out of

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.970 
Americans don't drink their milk out of
a<00:00:05.160> bag<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:06.180> today<00:00:06.690> I'm<00:00:07.020> me<00:00:07.230> showing<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.560> guys

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
a bag so today I'm me showing you guys

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.200 
a bag so today I'm me showing you guys
how<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> here<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.190> Ontario<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.030> have

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
how we do it so here in Ontario we have

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.410 
how we do it so here in Ontario we have
the<00:00:12.360> option<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.750> buy<00:00:12.990> milk<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.559> cartons<00:00:14.219> or<00:00:14.910> in

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
the option to buy milk in cartons or in

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.710 
the option to buy milk in cartons or in
bags<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.320> each<00:00:17.190> bag<00:00:17.520> comes<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.000> three

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
bags like this each bag comes with three

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.740 
bags like this each bag comes with three
mini<00:00:18.960> packets<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.609> 4<00:00:20.880> litres<00:00:21.180> in<00:00:21.359> total

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
mini packets and it's 4 litres in total

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.509 
mini packets and it's 4 litres in total
so<00:00:21.930> each<00:00:22.109> bag<00:00:22.380> would<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.890> 1.3<00:00:23.670> 3<00:00:24.210> litre<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
so each bag would have 1.3 3 litre and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.099 
so each bag would have 1.3 3 litre and
with<00:00:26.519> each<00:00:26.730> bag<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.210> comes<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> little<00:00:27.840> tag

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
with each bag it comes with a little tag

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.400 
with each bag it comes with a little tag
that<00:00:28.140> tells<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.099> milk<00:00:29.460> expires<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
that tells you when the milk expires and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.520 
that tells you when the milk expires and
we<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.550> easier<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> ship

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
we do this because it's easier to ship

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.910 
we do this because it's easier to ship
it's<00:00:34.530> also<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:35.040> cost<00:00:35.250> effective<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.920> it's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it's also more cost effective and it's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's also more cost effective and it's
better<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.579> environment<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.270> these

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
better for the environment because these

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
better for the environment because these
bags<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.110> recycled<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.190> make<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:41.940> you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
bags can be recycled just make sure you

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.900 
bags can be recycled just make sure you
rinse<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> milk

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
rinse it out so this is what the milk

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.220 
rinse it out so this is what the milk
bag<00:00:45.149> looks<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.719> ok<00:00:47.719> that's<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> looks

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bag looks like ok that's what it looks

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
bag looks like ok that's what it looks
like<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.739> milk<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> bag<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.239> you're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
like it's just milk in a bag so you're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
like it's just milk in a bag so you're
probably<00:00:52.199> wondering<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.460> earth<00:00:53.670> do<00:00:53.969> we

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
probably wondering how on earth do we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.979 
probably wondering how on earth do we
drink<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.579> our<00:00:56.879> milk<00:00:57.629> jugs

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
drink this so what we have our milk jugs

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979 
drink this so what we have our milk jugs
that<00:00:58.230> look<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.420> all<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that look like this and all you do is

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.420 
that look like this and all you do is
stick<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:04.100> take<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> pair<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
stick it in like so take a pair of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.950 
stick it in like so take a pair of
scissors<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.090> cut<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.170> tiny<00:01:07.619> triangle<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
scissors and cut off a tiny triangle and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.179 
scissors and cut off a tiny triangle and
as<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.680> over<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:13.010> already<00:01:14.010> have

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
as you can see over here we already have

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
as you can see over here we already have
one<00:01:14.400> that's<00:01:14.610> cut<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.930> size<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
one that's cut and the size of this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.310 
one that's cut and the size of this
triangle<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.340> crucial<00:01:17.909> because<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.170> cut

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
triangle is crucial because if you cut

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
triangle is crucial because if you cut
it<00:01:19.350> too<00:01:19.439> small<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.159> milk<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> come

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it too small the milk is going to come

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.050 
it too small the milk is going to come
out<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.330> slowly<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:23.250> people<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
out really slowly and what people what I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.719 
out really slowly and what people what I
tend<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> do<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.990> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
tend to do is kind of like

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.620 
tend to do is kind of like
overcompensate<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.060> whole<00:01:27.240> thing<00:01:27.450> will

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
overcompensate and the whole thing will

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.770 
overcompensate and the whole thing will
like<00:01:27.810> threaten<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> come<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.420> cut

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
like threaten to come out or if you cut

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.399 
like threaten to come out or if you cut
it<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:30.900> big<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> pour<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:34.110> gets

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it too big then when you pour it it gets

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
it too big then when you pour it it gets
really<00:01:34.710> heavy<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.000> droops

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
really heavy and it kind of like droops

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.710 
really heavy and it kind of like droops
down<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.909> make<00:01:39.090> sure<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.509> hang

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
down so you have to make sure you hang

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.819 
down so you have to make sure you hang
on<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.740> corner<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> pour<00:01:41.700> carefully<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
on to this corner and pour carefully so

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.639 
on to this corner and pour carefully so
yeah<00:01:43.860> mini<00:01:44.610> clothes<00:01:44.970> cold<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.140> spilled<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
yeah mini clothes cold and I spilled it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
yeah mini clothes cold and I spilled it
a<00:01:46.740> few<00:01:46.950> times<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.450> wakes<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.020> in
