session I have an instrument track and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.229 
session I have an instrument track and
beneath<00:00:40.680> each<00:00:40.920> instrument<00:00:41.280> track<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.120> the

same track printed to audio I've

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
same track printed to audio I've
recorded<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.629> MIDI<00:00:45.809> data<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.350> audio

recorded all of the MIDI data into audio

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
recorded all of the MIDI data into audio
by<00:00:46.950> busing<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> outputs<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> instrument

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
by busing the outputs of the instrument

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
by busing the outputs of the instrument
tracks<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:51.320> this<00:00:52.320> case<00:00:52.530> bus<00:00:52.860> 1<00:00:53.100> &amp;<00:00:53.250> 2<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
tracks in this case bus 1 &amp; 2 to the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.189 
tracks in this case bus 1 &amp; 2 to the
inputs<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.800> audio<00:00:56.070> track<00:00:56.370> again<00:00:57.030> bus<00:00:57.809> 1<00:00:58.050> &amp;

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.529 
inputs of the audio track again bus 1 &amp;
2<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> does<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.969> allows<00:01:00.210> me<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
2 and what this does is allows me to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.039 
2 and what this does is allows me to
record<00:01:00.930> enable<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.730> then<00:01:02.730> record<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.840> MIDI

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
record enable and then record the MIDI

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.620 
record enable and then record the MIDI
data<00:01:04.129> directly<00:01:05.129> into<00:01:05.339> an<00:01:05.460> audio<00:01:05.700> waveform<00:01:06.450> on

data directly into an audio waveform on
an<00:01:06.960> audio<00:01:07.200> track<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.070> good<00:01:08.280> idea<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
an audio track it's a good idea to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
an audio track it's a good idea to
record<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.270> audio<00:01:09.420> output<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.140> MIDI<00:01:10.409> or

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
record the audio output of any MIDI or

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.990 
record the audio output of any MIDI or
instrument<00:01:11.070> track<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> always<00:01:11.880> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
instrument track so that you always have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
instrument track so that you always have
a<00:01:12.210> hard<00:01:12.510> copy<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.170> perhaps<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> future

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a hard copy of it perhaps in the future

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
a hard copy of it perhaps in the future
you<00:01:14.610> decide<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> come<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> session

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you decide to come back to the session

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.590 
you decide to come back to the session
maybe<00:01:16.380> several<00:01:16.740> years<00:01:17.189> later<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.790> maybe<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
maybe several years later and maybe that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
maybe several years later and maybe that
virtual<00:01:19.110> instrument<00:01:19.530> doesn't<00:01:19.770> work<00:01:20.070> anymore

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
virtual instrument doesn't work anymore

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
virtual instrument doesn't work anymore
on<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.700> new<00:01:20.939> system<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.570> by<00:01:21.810> recording<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
on your new system so by recording the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.560 
on your new system so by recording the
part<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.740> audio<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:23.310> you'll<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
part to audio now you'll have it in the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539 
part to audio now you'll have it in the
future<00:01:24.780> even<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.500> can't<00:01:25.770> use<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> virtual

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
future even if you can't use the virtual

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
future even if you can't use the virtual
instrument<00:01:27.030> itself<00:01:27.299> another<00:01:27.990> advantage<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
instrument itself another advantage to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
instrument itself another advantage to
recording<00:01:29.100> instruments<00:01:29.369> into<00:01:29.759> audio<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
recording instruments into audio is that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
recording instruments into audio is that
you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.020> save<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.439> CPU<00:01:32.040> once<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.520> done

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you can save on CPU once you're done

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
you can save on CPU once you're done
with<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> part<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:33.570> deactivating<00:01:34.439> the
