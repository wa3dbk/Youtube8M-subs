Brian<00:00:49.170> Viloria<00:00:49.640> he<00:00:50.640> knows<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> he<00:00:51.239> didn't

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
Brian Viloria he knows that he didn't

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.880 
Brian Viloria he knows that he didn't
look<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> great<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.140> fight<00:00:52.350> he<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> think

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
look that great in this fight he I think

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
look that great in this fight he I think
I<00:00:53.070> saw<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.039> parts<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.190> post-fight

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
I saw one of the parts of the post-fight

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
I saw one of the parts of the post-fight
interview<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.199> he<00:00:58.350> raided<00:00:58.620> his

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
interview and I think he raided his

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.760 
interview and I think he raided his
performance<00:00:59.699> AC<00:00:59.910> plus<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.649> how

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
performance AC plus I think that's how

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.139 
performance AC plus I think that's how
much<00:01:01.949> he<00:01:01.980> rated<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.609> thought<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
much he rated it I thought it was like a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.950 
much he rated it I thought it was like a
c-minus<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> d-plus<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.369> wasn't<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.729> great

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
c-minus or a d-plus it wasn't that great

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
c-minus or a d-plus it wasn't that great
he<00:01:06.960> was<00:01:07.080> lucky<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> finding<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> guy

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
he was lucky that he was finding a guy

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000 
he was lucky that he was finding a guy
like<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.790> hedera<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.530> someone<00:01:10.860> else

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
like one hedera if this was someone else

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.859 
like one hedera if this was someone else
someone<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.400> top<00:01:11.640> ten<00:01:11.970> i<00:01:12.000> would<00:01:12.360> say<00:01:12.570> maybe

and he seriously needs to step it up I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.200 
and he seriously needs to step it up I
mean<00:01:26.220> right<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> performance

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
mean right now with that performance

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.160 
mean right now with that performance
everyone<00:01:30.210> who's<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> champion<00:01:30.810> right<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
everyone who's the champion right now I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.200 
everyone who's the champion right now I
think<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.680> beat<00:01:31.890> him<00:01:32.070> even<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> night

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

think would beat him even the night
intentions<00:01:33.780> may<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> top<00:01:34.320> 10<00:01:34.560> everyone<00:01:34.950> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
intentions may be the top 10 everyone a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
intentions may be the top 10 everyone a
top<00:01:35.220> ten<00:01:35.460> could<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:35.939> beat<00:01:36.180> him<00:01:36.329> right

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
top ten could probably beat him right

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.740 
top ten could probably beat him right
now<00:01:36.509> after<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.990> performance<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.610> uh<00:01:38.750> yeah
