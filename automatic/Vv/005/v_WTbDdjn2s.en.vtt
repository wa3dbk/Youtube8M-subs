hi<00:00:12.380> today<00:00:12.770> we're<00:00:12.920> going<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.100> give<00:00:13.220> a

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
hi today we're going to give a

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.190 
hi today we're going to give a
demonstration<00:00:13.520> of<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:14.300> starting<00:00:14.720> ability<00:00:15.110> of

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
demonstration of the starting ability of

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200 
demonstration of the starting ability of
the<00:00:15.350> antigravity<00:00:15.740> mic<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.580> start<00:00:16.850> this<00:00:17.030> is

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
the antigravity mic the start this is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.109 
the antigravity mic the start this is
the<00:00:17.300> xp1<00:00:18.020> model<00:00:18.440> and<00:00:18.800> we<00:00:19.610> have<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:19.760> Ducati

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
the xp1 model and we have a Ducati

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.830 
the xp1 model and we have a Ducati
Hypermotard<00:00:20.630> 1,100<00:00:21.470> CC<00:00:21.920> v-twin<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:23.210> attached

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
Hypermotard 1,100 CC v-twin and attached

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.200 
Hypermotard 1,100 CC v-twin and attached
the<00:00:24.290> spark<00:00:24.770> plug<00:00:24.950> cable<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:25.520> it<00:00:25.580> won't<00:00:25.760> start

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
the spark plug cable so it won't start

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.240 
the spark plug cable so it won't start
but<00:00:26.570> this<00:00:26.779> will<00:00:26.990> have<00:00:27.200> full<00:00:27.440> compression<00:00:27.800> and

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
but this will have full compression and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.159 
but this will have full compression and
give<00:00:28.520> you<00:00:28.640> an<00:00:28.700> idea<00:00:28.849> of<00:00:29.119> how<00:00:29.599> well<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:29.960> turns

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
give you an idea of how well it turns

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.440 
give you an idea of how well it turns
over<00:00:30.380> bikes<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.730> I'm<00:00:32.000> going<00:00:32.119> to<00:00:32.180> put<00:00:32.330> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
over bikes so I'm going to put the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.680 
over bikes so I'm going to put the
jumpstarters<00:00:33.760> into<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.880> micro<00:00:35.240> start

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
jumpstarters into the micro start

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.350 
jumpstarters into the micro start
gonna<00:00:36.110> jump<00:00:36.440> start<00:00:36.740> claps<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.910> set<00:00:41.120> up<00:00:41.239> the

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
gonna jump start claps you set up the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.780 
gonna jump start claps you set up the
Ducati<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:41.870> can<00:00:42.020> see<00:00:42.170> it<00:00:42.230> has<00:00:42.350> no<00:00:42.380> battery<00:00:42.790> and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
Ducati you can see it has no battery and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.090 
Ducati you can see it has no battery and
we<00:00:43.970> just<00:00:44.180> set<00:00:44.360> up<00:00:44.450> some<00:00:44.500> plants<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.740> new

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
we just set up some plants to new

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.119 
we just set up some plants to new
connections

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 

so<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.730> Ducati<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.390> automatic<00:00:54.780> shut<00:00:55.170> off

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
so the Ducati has an automatic shut off

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
so the Ducati has an automatic shut off
after<00:00:55.530> about<00:00:55.800> seven<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> ten<00:00:56.309> seconds<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
after about seven to ten seconds of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.340 
after about seven to ten seconds of
attempting<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> started<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:57.989> we'll<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
attempting that started so we'll do this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:16.350 
attempting that started so we'll do this
a<00:00:58.379> couple<00:00:58.500> times<00:01:01.159> turn<00:01:02.159> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> key

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.460 

okay<00:01:17.360> bye<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:17.570> your<00:01:17.930> bike<00:01:18.140> should<00:01:18.320> have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
okay bye now your bike should have

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
okay bye now your bike should have
started<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.070> we're<00:01:19.160> going<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.550> again

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.410 

I<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> again<00:01:32.010> again<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
I just do it again again this is just

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.180 
I just do it again again this is just
the<00:01:33.630> Micra<00:01:33.960> start<00:01:34.229> alone<00:01:34.530> without<00:01:34.770> any

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
the Micra start alone without any

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:47.430 
the Micra start alone without any
battery<00:01:35.610> energy<00:01:35.850> potty

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.840 

now<00:01:48.440> if<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.680> bike<00:01:48.830> hasn't<00:01:49.220> started<00:01:49.400> by<00:01:49.640> now

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
now if your bike hasn't started by now

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.400 
now if your bike hasn't started by now
you<00:01:49.910> have<00:01:50.240> other<00:01:50.390> problems<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.200> we're<00:01:51.380> just

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
you have other problems but we're just

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.990 
you have other problems but we're just
trying<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.860> demonstrate<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.490> power<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
trying to demonstrate the power of the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.480 
trying to demonstrate the power of the
micro<00:01:53.360> starts<00:01:53.690> and<00:01:53.870> I'll<00:01:53.930> do<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.080> again

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.370 

so<00:02:05.490> far<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.730> think<00:02:05.820> I've<00:02:06.150> done<00:02:06.360> three<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:06.990> four

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so far I think I've done three or four

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
so far I think I've done three or four
ten<00:02:07.770> seconds<00:02:08.220> attempts<00:02:08.640> we're<00:02:08.820> going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> do

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
ten seconds attempts we're going to do

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.160 
ten seconds attempts we're going to do
it<00:02:09.240> again<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.600> then<00:02:09.750> we're<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.930> to<00:02:10.020> go<00:02:10.140> over

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it again and then we're going to go over

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:21.490 
it again and then we're going to go over
to<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> Toyota<00:02:10.800> v6

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.990 

and<00:02:22.500> we'd<00:02:23.040> say<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.519> want<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> do<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.970> more

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and we'd say I just want to do one more

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.699 
and we'd say I just want to do one more
for<00:02:24.330> good<00:02:24.390> measure<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.959> three<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.500> your

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
for good measure because three of your

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:44.119 
for good measure because three of your
other<00:02:25.830> buddies<00:02:26.190> bikes<00:02:26.459> what's<00:02:26.760> dead<00:02:43.129> our

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
other buddies bikes what's dead our

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:53.420 
other buddies bikes what's dead our
Toyota<00:02:44.549> v6<00:02:51.680> remove<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.860> cables<00:02:53.250> from<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
Toyota v6 remove the cables from the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.210 
Toyota v6 remove the cables from the
battery<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.180> there's<00:02:54.359> no<00:02:54.660> chance<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.739> battery

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
battery so there's no chance of battery

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.949 
battery so there's no chance of battery
assist<00:02:57.109> and<00:02:58.109> we're<00:02:58.950> gonna<00:02:59.099> connect<00:02:59.750> my<00:03:00.750> car

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
assist and we're gonna connect my car

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.970 
assist and we're gonna connect my car
start<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.810> Toyota<00:03:03.810> v6<00:03:04.170> motor<00:03:04.470> make<00:03:04.799> sure

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
start to the Toyota v6 motor make sure

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.069 
start to the Toyota v6 motor make sure
that<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:06.299> terminals<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> good

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
that the terminals have a good

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:54.790 
that the terminals have a good
connection

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.380 

you'll<00:03:55.800> notice<00:03:55.980> I'm<00:03:56.280> repeating<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:57.000> start<00:03:57.300> it

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
you'll notice I'm repeating to start it

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.120 
you'll notice I'm repeating to start it
over<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.810> over<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> reason<00:03:58.560> being<00:03:58.890> is

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
over and over and the reason being is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.380 
over and over and the reason being is
that<00:03:59.160> I<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.430> want<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.760> demonstrate<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
that I just want to demonstrate the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.090 
that I just want to demonstrate the
power<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.930> micro<00:04:01.290> start<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:01.920> don't

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
power of the micro start but we don't

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.770 
power of the micro start but we don't
suggest<00:04:02.310> doing<00:04:02.640> this<00:04:02.910> with<00:04:03.210> your<00:04:03.420> own<00:04:03.510> car

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
suggest doing this with your own car

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:21.530 
suggest doing this with your own car
because<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.410> starter<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.190> not

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.640 

now<00:04:22.540> what<00:04:22.720> we're<00:04:22.870> going<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:23.050> do<00:04:23.199> is<00:04:23.320> we'll<00:04:23.500> go

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
now what we're going to do is we'll go
