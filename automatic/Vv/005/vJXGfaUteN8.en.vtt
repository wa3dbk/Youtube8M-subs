somebody's teams constructed so let's
check<00:02:29.250> out<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.730> defense<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.890> this

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
check out this defense and this is this

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
check out this defense and this is this
is<00:02:32.970> how<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.299> goes<00:02:33.329> man<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.320> about

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
is how it goes man this is all about

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.720 
is how it goes man this is all about
choices<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.609> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:36.320> nobody<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.530> his

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
choices that you can see nobody on his

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.030 
choices that you can see nobody on his
defensive<00:02:38.730> line<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.209> above<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.810> 75<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.769> whoever

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
defensive line is above a 75 so whoever

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.099 
defensive line is above a 75 so whoever
was<00:02:41.250> drafting<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.760> team<00:02:42.030> must<00:02:42.720> feel<00:02:42.930> like

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
was drafting this team must feel like

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.410 
was drafting this team must feel like
the<00:02:43.260> defensive<00:02:43.739> line<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.640> important

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the defensive line is not as important

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.530 
the defensive line is not as important
in<00:02:45.570> menton<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.260> other<00:02:47.070> pieces<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.480> puzzle

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
in menton as other pieces of the puzzle

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.509 
in menton as other pieces of the puzzle
we<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> linebacker<00:02:50.709> Situationists

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
which is still pretty pretty weak we

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.380 
which is still pretty pretty weak we
don't<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.459> what<00:02:54.609> cards<00:02:54.909> they<00:02:55.030> got<00:02:55.209> we<00:02:55.359> don't

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
was important secondary help everybody's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.979 
was important secondary help everybody's
above<00:03:11.560> an<00:03:11.769> 80<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.189> we<00:03:12.489> even<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:13.030> 87<00:03:13.599> so<00:03:13.900> we

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
above an 80 and we even have a 87 so we

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.479 
above an 80 and we even have a 87 so we
can<00:03:14.109> see<00:03:14.260> when<00:03:14.439> a<00:03:14.470> defensive<00:03:14.920> car<00:03:15.129> when<00:03:15.400> the
