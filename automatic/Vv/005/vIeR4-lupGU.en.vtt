00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello girls today I would love to share 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.330
 a super discovery that are some 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.970
 Korean creams I am not very given to 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.400
 recommend creams because I think there 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.980
 many types of skins and I think there are 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.670
 to try each one but I know that with 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.070
 this recommendation I will not fail where 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.890
 we can get it on the page 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.890
 web that at your reach is 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.950
 www.comerica.com how I wanted to share it 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.210
 with you I got in touch with the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.890
 person who imported the creams 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.120
 of Korea are called ruth mafias and they 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.660
 I asked how was this process will 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.329
 He said he met them in Hong Kong 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.530
 and that interested him, they impacted him so much 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 Well, he got in touch with 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:07.060
 the laboratory of korea and well then the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.479
 has imported to Spain and we have them 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.280
 here ruth says he realized 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.120
 investigating a little bit that the 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.070
 Korean creams are 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.350
 the number one in cosmetics in the world 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.630
 but that in Spain are not well known 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 they are number one because it goes ahead and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.450
 of research in technology and in 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.550
 ingredients are a pass now I'm going 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.610
 to talk a little about each of them 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.700
 in the five Korean steps for the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.700
 skin care is cleaning 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.980
 hydration treatment renewal and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 protection and for each of these 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.800
 steps have their specific products 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 for dry or normal skin or for 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.790
 skins 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.310
 lists and fats these Korean creams 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.110
 I want to introduce you and bring you to call 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.250
 your corner to the first step that is the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.210
 cleaning have this product that is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.880
 flame over powder wash and good is very 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.320
 special because it's made with some 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.720
 powders that got our hands and what 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.080
 mix with water and it is formed as a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.840
 foam can serve us simply as 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.490
 cleaner or if we miss him less 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.820
 amount of water that serves as 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.820
 exfoliating for skin renewal 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.540
 this product that has been made 8 by 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.870
 cent for normal and dry skin and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.790
 for skins that are fat and mixed 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.070
 that day pha 8% this product what 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.130
 I would use at night there is no 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.860
 clarify it on top of him and I would put a 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.140
 moisturizer and gradually 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.160
 we will see how it is eliminating the cells 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.700
 dead and gives a better appearance to the skin 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.800
 we have the c-max that has vitamin by 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.430
 the great novelty vitamins that have 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.650
 many products many brands but it is 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.800
 the concentrate have concentrate up 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.570
 of 25 percent vitamin C that 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.460
 we get with this then with the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.550
 vitamin C 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.790
 it moisturizes a little effect 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.970
 lifting and helps to expel the points 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.220
 whites and blacks that are created from the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.410
 society or that they do not appropriate treated 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.490
 Eject this product also 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.900
 use at night 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:42.730
 and I would try to alternate the ah 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.650
 with the gel bucks of vitamin c because 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.400
 it would slow down what we would call renewal and 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.550
 treatment to get that skin that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.540
 We are looking forward to stopping all 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.120
 that smooth skin with closed without porn 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.819
 stain 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.459
 hydrated light for hydration 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.370
 There are several types of products but the 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.159
 that I have tried and recommend is the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.940
 water tells what is this and in biological 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.909
 Moisturizing ferment these 2 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.290
 this would be mainly from hamas as 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.660
 a cream 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.910
 is for very dry skin this is not what 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.830
 I would recommend stress to oily skin 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 for you are very dry for skins that 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.370
 they are already dehydrated and this is like a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.920
 little our cream from day to day I the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 would put at night and in the morning 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.860
 all the creams that I have explained to you are 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.310
 anti-aging and anti-wrinkle 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.409
 it's a Korean ritual that's good as 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.629
 we can observe in asia they have some 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:49.030
 incredible stones I propose a lot for 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.770
 the skin care this is the new 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.050
 discovery following this ritual 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.750
 and will improve the skin in addition in three or 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.350
 four days you will start it a notary 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.810
 The truth is that I hallucinated and wanted 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.000
 share it with you 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.380
 apart it belongs to a line of 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.480
 high-end high-end cosmetics but 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.200
 with a very affordable price that gives us 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.300
 like the 40 euros another advice to say 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.849
 for the skins 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.580
 who are dehydrated is better 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.460
 cream stones general what you have go 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.349
 to better the creams that are like more 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.990
 together as in change for the skins 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:34.169
 fats I recommend that you use the 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:38.690
 emulsions that are much lighter and 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:42.539
 they do not saturate and they are fat that we already have 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:46.080
 naturally in the skin the last step 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:50.169
 would be the protection we use a 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.009
 showcase that would be that 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:56.169
 and well with it we get to 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:01.360
 from protecting the skin unifies the 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:05.199
 smooth tone gives light and good as it helps 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.039
 not have those spots that would be all the 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:13.479
 treatment the five steps of the ritual 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.289
 Korean here is another little advice from 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.849
 go up 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:22.180
 kim that is me I asked ruth that 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.069
 I opened for teenagers I have many 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.479
 friends with problems and there are many 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.479
 very young models that also 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:31.960
 they have skin problems especially 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.729
 hormones then he told me that 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.259
 is going to bring Spain is still not there but 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:41.310
 very soon it arrives that this line is like 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.540
 you can observe leads as a symbol of 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.410
 urgency 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.230
 and then it's for acne is a line that 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.570
 have created specific for that intention 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.020
 of the skin will come soon and I know 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.820
 that will greatly help your 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.770
 daughters or you 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.550
 if you have problems with all the girls 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.960
 who are at the age of adolescence 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.639
 well yes 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.280
 this skin problem is to create 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.930
 quite insecure and it is very uncomfortable 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.820
 I hope you tell me something 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.820
 I encourage you to try it 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.330
 here
