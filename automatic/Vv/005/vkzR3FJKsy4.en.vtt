battery<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:19.460> 10<00:00:20.460> days<00:00:20.750> 22<00:00:21.750> hours<00:00:22.490> 56

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
battery for now 10 days 22 hours 56

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.740 
battery for now 10 days 22 hours 56
minutes<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> about<00:00:25.320> 56<00:00:26.130> seconds<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
minutes and about 56 seconds if I just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:37.310 
minutes and about 56 seconds if I just
refresh<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:31.820> we<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:36.320> nineteen

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
refresh that and we are on nineteen

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.920 
refresh that and we are on nineteen
percent<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> date<00:00:39.660> right

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
percent and you can see the date right

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.970 
percent and you can see the date right
there<00:00:46.670> yet<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.480> nineteen<00:00:48.870> percent<00:00:48.989> has<00:00:49.710> given

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
there yet so nineteen percent has given

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
there yet so nineteen percent has given
me<00:00:50.070> roughly<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.629> coming<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> eleven

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
me roughly about coming up to eleven

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.880 
me roughly about coming up to eleven
days<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:53.239> could<00:00:54.239> probably<00:00:54.559> run<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> for

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
days now I could probably run that for

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.139 
days now I could probably run that for
another<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.699> maybe<00:00:57.660> three<00:00:57.930> days<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
another two maybe three days so I'm just

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
maximize the battery on this so first

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
your screen put brightness all the way

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.440 
your screen put brightness all the way
to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.479> bottom<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:16.049> low<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> possibly<00:01:17.369> can

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.550 

when<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> screen<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.229> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
when the screen is that is for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.999 
when the screen is that is for
brightness<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.990> burns<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.650> retina

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
brightness it just burns your retina

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
brightness it just burns your retina
there's<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:27.930> anyone<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
there's no need I don't think anyone in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.780 
there's no need I don't think anyone in
the<00:01:28.650> world<00:01:28.799> needs<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> be

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the world needs that it's going to be

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.170 
the world needs that it's going to be
that<00:01:29.970> bright<00:01:30.979> even<00:01:31.979> automatic<00:01:32.610> brightness<00:01:32.759> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that bright even automatic brightness I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.620 
that bright even automatic brightness I
wouldn't<00:01:33.570> even<00:01:33.630> set<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.500> because

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
wouldn't even set that to it because

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.160 
wouldn't even set that to it because
it's<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.229> good<00:01:39.110> putting<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it's just not as good putting it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
it's just not as good putting it
straight<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> bottom<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.670> still

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
straight to the bottom you can still

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
straight to the bottom you can still
read<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.869> still<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.170> whatever<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.649> want

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
read you can still do whatever you want

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.480 
read you can still do whatever you want
to<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> camera

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to do you can see that from the camera

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.730 
to do you can see that from the camera
that<00:01:47.490> alone<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> save<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.560> much

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that alone is going to save so much

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.340 
that alone is going to save so much
battery<00:01:52.340> another<00:01:53.340> thing<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.350> your

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
battery another thing to do is your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.100 
battery another thing to do is your
Wi-Fi<00:01:57.170> by<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.530> Wi-Fi<00:01:58.740> settings<00:01:59.219> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
Wi-Fi by going into Wi-Fi settings and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100 
Wi-Fi by going into Wi-Fi settings and
disconnect<00:02:01.110> policy<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:03.180> set<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.810> when

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
disconnect policy if you set it to when

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.180 
disconnect policy if you set it to when
screen<00:02:04.439> turns<00:02:04.740> off<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.219> Wi-Fi<00:02:05.430> disconnects

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
screen turns off the Wi-Fi disconnects

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
screen turns off the Wi-Fi disconnects
you'll<00:02:08.190> end<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.670> saving<00:02:08.940> again<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you'll end up saving again a lot of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.320 
you'll end up saving again a lot of
battery<00:02:10.379> because<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.790> screen<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.209> off

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
battery because when the screen is off

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.350 
battery because when the screen is off
the<00:02:14.330> Wi-Fi<00:02:14.720> radio<00:02:15.080> turns<00:02:15.350> itself<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:15.800> as<00:02:16.100> well

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
the Wi-Fi radio turns itself off as well

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.310 
the Wi-Fi radio turns itself off as well
so<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:18.110> results<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:19.030> no<00:02:20.030> data<00:02:20.690> coming<00:02:20.990> through

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
so it results in no data coming through

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.950 
so it results in no data coming through
obviously<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.340> won't<00:02:22.460> get<00:02:22.640> your

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
obviously you won't get your

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.290 
obviously you won't get your
notifications<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.790> but<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.000> saves

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
notifications and all that but it saves

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.590 
notifications and all that but it saves
battery<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:28.460> reason<00:02:28.640> why<00:02:29.480> i'm

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
battery and that's the reason why i'm

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.820 
battery and that's the reason why i'm
doing<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:29.840> video<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.380> want<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.650> save

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
doing this video you want to save

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.060 
doing this video you want to save
battery<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.850> that's<00:02:35.000> one<00:02:35.210> thing<00:02:35.950> well<00:02:36.950> that's

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
battery so that's one thing well that's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.400 
battery so that's one thing well that's
the<00:02:37.130> second<00:02:37.400> thing<00:02:37.630> another<00:02:38.630> thing<00:02:38.870> which<00:02:39.260> i

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
the second thing another thing which i

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
much the most battery it's when you

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.790 
much the most battery it's when you
don't<00:02:47.360> need<00:02:47.870> your<00:02:48.020> device<00:02:49.480> night<00:02:50.480> time<00:02:50.800> you're

like that so i have used it medium to

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.350 
like that so i have used it medium to
light<00:05:12.210> use<00:05:13.940> obviously<00:05:14.940> if<00:05:15.060> you're<00:05:15.180> going<00:05:15.270> to

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
light use obviously if you're going to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.999 
light use obviously if you're going to
do<00:05:15.509> heavy<00:05:16.199> usage<00:05:17.270> you'll<00:05:18.270> probably<00:05:18.509> get<00:05:19.009> we're

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
do heavy usage you'll probably get we're

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.740 
do heavy usage you'll probably get we're
