okay<00:01:16.509> well<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:16.810> think<00:01:16.869> that's<00:01:17.289> enough<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:17.619> this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
okay well I think that's enough for this

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.120 
okay well I think that's enough for this
experiment<00:01:18.490> because<00:01:18.939> if<00:01:19.119> they're<00:01:19.299> bad<00:01:19.950> what

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
experiment because if they're bad what

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.870 
experiment because if they're bad what
I<00:01:21.159> still<00:01:21.430> got<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.850> bucket<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.390> half<00:01:22.570> left

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880

I still got a bucket and a half left

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
probably two hours and I actually tried

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.750 
probably two hours and I actually tried
a<00:01:59.350> piece<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.800> this<00:01:59.890> just<00:01:59.950> about<00:02:00.310> ten<00:02:00.610> minutes

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
a piece of this just about ten minutes

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.470 
a piece of this just about ten minutes
ago<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:03.480> it's<00:02:04.480> amazing<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.970> egg<00:02:07.150> does

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
ago on it's amazing that the egg does

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.020 
ago on it's amazing that the egg does
actually<00:02:07.840> take<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.950> smoke<00:02:09.310> flavor<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.850> there

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
actually take that smoke flavor in there

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.320 
actually take that smoke flavor in there
like<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.210> piece<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.479> meat<00:02:10.750> does<00:02:10.960> and<00:02:12.330> it's

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
like a piece of meat does and it's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.540 
like a piece of meat does and it's
really<00:02:13.600> light<00:02:13.930> flavored<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:14.950> really

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
really light flavored but it's really

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.540 
really light flavored but it's really
good<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.740> thought<00:02:17.740> they<00:02:17.860> would<00:02:18.010> get<00:02:18.100> darker

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550

good I thought they would get darker
Brown<00:02:18.790> than<00:02:19.030> this<00:02:19.240> but<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.870> doesn't<00:02:20.170> matter

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
Brown than this but that doesn't matter
