00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
or a few five to four our heads

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.729 
or a few five to four our heads
you<00:00:56.420> would<00:00:56.540> probably<00:00:56.720> turn<00:00:57.140> around<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.590> say

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
you would probably turn around and say

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.799 
you would probably turn around and say
well<00:00:58.370> let's<00:00:58.730> not<00:00:58.880> just<00:00:59.059> do<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.300> in<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.630> one

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
well let's not just do that in the one

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.389 
well let's not just do that in the one
that<00:01:00.050> was<00:01:00.230> still<00:01:00.440> over<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.860> hundred<00:01:01.220> or<00:01:01.340> a

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
that was still over a hundred or a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.030 
that was still over a hundred or a
thousand<00:01:01.850> bets<00:01:02.059> because<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:02.570> know<00:01:03.040> that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
thousand bets because you know that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.429 
thousand bets because you know that
sooner<00:01:04.369> or<00:01:04.399> later<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:05.570> could<00:01:05.780> probably<00:01:06.049> take

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
sooner or later it could probably take

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.109 
sooner or later it could probably take
years<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.860> be<00:01:07.070> quite<00:01:07.310> honest<00:01:07.549> with<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:07.850> but

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
years to be quite honest with you but

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.260 
years to be quite honest with you but
sooner<00:01:08.960> or<00:01:08.990> later<00:01:09.190> if<00:01:10.190> everything<00:01:10.790> turns<00:01:10.820> out

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
sooner or later if everything turns out

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.820 
sooner or later if everything turns out
equal<00:01:11.750> there's<00:01:11.930> an<00:01:12.020> equal<00:01:12.350> number<00:01:12.620> of<00:01:12.650> her

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
equal there's an equal number of her

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.740 
equal there's an equal number of her
pets<00:01:13.159> an<00:01:13.430> equal<00:01:13.790> number<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:14.090> towers<00:01:14.299> you<00:01:14.570> will

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
pets an equal number of towers you will

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.380 
pets an equal number of towers you will
be<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.020> profit<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.549> same<00:01:16.790> goes<00:01:17.090> if

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
be in profit and the same goes if

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.530 
be in profit and the same goes if
somebody<00:01:18.110> offered<00:01:18.440> you<00:01:19.060> fortifying<00:01:20.060> instead

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
somebody offered you fortifying instead

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.560 
somebody offered you fortifying instead
that's<00:01:21.110> under<00:01:21.560> evens<00:01:21.979> and<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:22.909> know<00:01:23.360> that

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
that's under evens and so you know that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.750 
that's under evens and so you know that
over<00:01:23.690> time<00:01:23.990> all<00:01:24.380> things<00:01:24.650> being<00:01:24.890> equal<00:01:25.040> you

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
over time all things being equal you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.500 
over time all things being equal you
would<00:01:25.909> lose<00:01:26.180> money

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
would lose money

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.680 
would lose money
and<00:01:27.380> that's<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:28.030> we<00:01:29.030> referred<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.570> as

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
and that's what we we referred to as

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.740 
and that's what we we referred to as
value<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.320> what<00:01:30.530> -<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.570> standard<00:01:32.570> bet

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
value so what - one is a standard bet

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.270 
value so what - one is a standard bet
there's<00:01:33.020> no<00:01:33.140> funding<00:01:33.530> either<00:01:33.740> way<00:01:33.979> a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
there's no funding either way a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.700 
there's no funding either way a
five-to-four<00:01:35.060> there's<00:01:35.540> value<00:01:35.900> on<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:36.260> and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
five-to-four there's value on that and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.590 
five-to-four there's value on that and
it's<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.950> good<00:01:37.100> place<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.420> say<00:01:38.420> good<00:01:38.570> things

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's a good place to say good things

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.170 
it's a good place to say good things
about<00:01:38.900> one<00:01:39.229> when<00:01:39.350> you<00:01:39.470> do<00:01:39.650> every<00:01:39.970> every<00:01:40.970> day<00:01:41.119> of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
about one when you do every every day of

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.870 
about one when you do every every day of
the<00:01:41.299> week<00:01:41.330> whereas<00:01:42.290> four<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.650> five<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.250> not<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
the week whereas four to five is not a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660 
the week whereas four to five is not a
good<00:01:44.119> value<00:01:44.360> bet<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:44.930> you<00:01:45.049> stay<00:01:45.380> away<00:01:45.580> so<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
good value bet and you stay away so the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.660 
good value bet and you stay away so the
question<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.150> how<00:01:47.450> do<00:01:47.509> we<00:01:47.750> find<00:01:47.990> value<00:01:48.670> but

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
question is how do we find value but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.340 
question is how do we find value but
without<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.939> tournament<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.720> government<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.229> my

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
without a tournament a government to my

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.710 
without a tournament a government to my
computer<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:52.310> panel<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.790> SEC<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.509> swap

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
computer so this panel the SEC we swap

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.330 
computer so this panel the SEC we swap
over<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.409> computer<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.009> I'll<00:01:55.130> show<00:01:55.310> you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
over to the computer and I'll show you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.960 
over to the computer and I'll show you
how<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.090> how<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.110> think<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.189> can<00:01:58.400> find<00:01:58.640> value

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
how I how I think you can find value

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.420 
how I how I think you can find value
quite<00:01:59.270> quickly<00:01:59.659> from<00:02:00.409> sources<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.100> are<00:02:01.250> all

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
quite quickly from sources that are all

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.789 
quite quickly from sources that are all
already<00:02:01.970> available<00:02:02.329> on<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.930> internet<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:03.770> we

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
already available on the internet so we

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.130 
already available on the internet so we
describe<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.600> turn<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.750> computer

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
describe you to the turn of the computer

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.059 
describe you to the turn of the computer
now

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.440 

okay<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.269> how<00:02:10.420> do<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.599> actually<00:02:10.869> find<00:02:11.349> value

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
okay so how do we actually find value

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.869 
okay so how do we actually find value
well<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.629> we<00:02:14.200> need<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.010> first<00:02:15.340> look<00:02:15.670> for

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
well I think we need to first look for

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.170 
well I think we need to first look for
someone<00:02:16.390> or<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:17.290> group<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.950> people<00:02:18.010> who<00:02:19.000> can

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
someone or some group of people who can

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.420 
someone or some group of people who can
at<00:02:19.299> least<00:02:19.480> tell<00:02:19.750> us<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.260> actual<00:02:20.920> odds<00:02:21.159> of

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
at least tell us what the actual odds of

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.390 
at least tell us what the actual odds of
a<00:02:21.519> horse<00:02:21.790> win<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.329> the<00:02:22.450> race<00:02:22.709> are<00:02:23.709> with<00:02:24.159> some

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
a horse win in the race are with some

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.059 
a horse win in the race are with some
accuracy<00:02:25.030> or<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.900> chances<00:02:26.409> of<00:02:26.439> a<00:02:26.650> horse<00:02:26.859> win

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
accuracy or the chances of a horse win

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.089 
accuracy or the chances of a horse win
in<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.280> race<00:02:27.310> are<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:27.909> some<00:02:28.090> accuracy<00:02:29.099> so

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
in the race are with some accuracy so

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.020 
in the race are with some accuracy so
who<00:02:30.250> do<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.519> think<00:02:30.939> we<00:02:31.450> could<00:02:31.659> trust<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:34.000> need

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
who do you think we could trust we need

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.970 
who do you think we could trust we need
someone<00:02:34.480> who<00:02:34.659> has<00:02:34.689> been<00:02:34.989> valuing<00:02:35.409> horses<00:02:35.799> for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
someone who has been valuing horses for

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.429 
someone who has been valuing horses for
some<00:02:36.159> time<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.569> we<00:02:37.659> can<00:02:37.840> trust<00:02:38.139> that

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
some time and that we can trust that

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.530 
some time and that we can trust that
they<00:02:38.829> have<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:39.310> systems<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.969> place<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.239> be

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
they have the systems in place to be

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.619 
they have the systems in place to be
pretty<00:02:40.810> accurate<00:02:41.049> about<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.560> prices<00:02:42.569> well<00:02:43.569> I

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
pretty accurate about the prices well I

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.390 
pretty accurate about the prices well I
don't<00:02:43.840> know<00:02:43.900> about<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> immediately

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
don't know about you but I immediately

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.349 
don't know about you but I immediately
think<00:02:45.939> of<00:02:46.120> sites<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:47.799> racing<00:02:48.220> post<00:02:48.519> calm

some cases over a hundred years so don't
you<00:03:07.180> think<00:03:07.419> they<00:03:07.569> would<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:07.750> pretty<00:03:08.200> good<00:03:08.470> at

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
you think they would be pretty good at

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.849 
you think they would be pretty good at
it

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
it

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.699

by<00:03:09.040> now<00:03:09.599> if<00:03:10.599> you<00:03:11.019> watch<00:03:11.260> they're<00:03:11.530> betting

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
by now if you watch they're betting

predicting the ESPY the starting price

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.849 
predicting the ESPY the starting price
and<00:03:18.669> unless<00:03:19.419> there<00:03:19.690> are<00:03:19.720> non<00:03:20.169> runners<00:03:20.530> in<00:03:20.739> a

race or for some reason a particular

race or for some reason a particular
runner<00:03:22.959> gets<00:03:23.199> very<00:03:23.470> heavily<00:03:23.859> backed<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
runner gets very heavily backed the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.580 
runner gets very heavily backed the
prices<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.449> they<00:03:25.599> show<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:26.139> be<00:03:26.290> pretty

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
prices that they show can be pretty

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.000 
prices that they show can be pretty
accurate<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:28.629> best<00:03:28.840> way<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.019> use<00:03:29.409> this<00:03:29.590> idea

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
accurate the best way to use this idea

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.770 
accurate the best way to use this idea
is<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> take<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.639> prices<00:03:31.090> from<00:03:31.239> several

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
is to take the prices from several

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.589 
is to take the prices from several
different<00:03:31.989> sources<00:03:32.699> but<00:03:33.699> you<00:03:33.849> know<00:03:34.150> are<00:03:34.389> not

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
different sources but you know are not

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.199 
different sources but you know are not
linked<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.199> where<00:03:35.709> they<00:03:35.889> agree<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:37.180> should

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
linked and where they agree you should

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.629 
linked and where they agree you should
be<00:03:37.569> quite<00:03:37.780> confidently<00:03:38.530> if<00:03:38.739> all<00:03:38.979> things<00:03:39.370> stay

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
be quite confidently if all things stay

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.030 
be quite confidently if all things stay
equal<00:03:39.909> no<00:03:40.569> non-runners<00:03:41.079> or<00:03:41.260> sudden<00:03:41.680> rushes

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
equal no non-runners or sudden rushes

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.949 
equal no non-runners or sudden rushes
for<00:03:42.250> other<00:03:42.400> runners<00:03:42.819> then<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.659> a<00:03:43.690> good

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
for other runners then you have a good

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.530 
for other runners then you have a good
idea<00:03:44.139> of<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.889> value<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.489> each<00:03:45.699> horse<00:03:46.030> in<00:03:46.299> the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
idea of the value of each horse in the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.710 
idea of the value of each horse in the
race<00:03:46.569> now<00:03:47.699> all<00:03:48.699> you<00:03:48.819> have<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:49.000> do<00:03:49.269> is<00:03:49.540> look

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
race now all you have to do is look

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.599
