00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.740 

okay<00:00:05.279> notice<00:00:05.460> my<00:00:05.759> settings<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.359> I'm<00:00:06.420> hunting

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
okay notice my settings and I'm hunting

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.580 
okay notice my settings and I'm hunting
with<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.050> new<00:00:07.170> 13-inch<00:00:07.700> DTEC<00:00:08.700> oil<00:00:09.530> here's<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
with the new 13-inch DTEC oil here's a

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:28.939 
with the new 13-inch DTEC oil here's a
deeper<00:00:10.980> sounding<00:00:11.340> target<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:28.230> problem<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.800> I

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
deeper sounding target the problem was I

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.179 
deeper sounding target the problem was I
just<00:00:29.160> dug<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> target<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:29.939> was<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:31.189> apparently

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
just dug a target that was a apparently

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
just dug a target that was a apparently
deep<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.510> two<00:00:33.690> targets<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.379> thought

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
deep but it was two targets I thought

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.860 
deep but it was two targets I thought
and<00:00:35.030> there<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.150> coin<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.570> middle<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and there was a coin in the middle of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.390 
and there was a coin in the middle of
the<00:00:36.960> two<00:00:37.080> targets<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.589> maybe<00:00:37.769> this<00:00:37.979> is<00:00:38.129> another

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
the two targets so maybe this is another

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.399 
the two targets so maybe this is another
one<00:00:38.729> on<00:00:38.879> edge<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:40.670> here's<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:42.409> deep

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
one on edge because here's another deep

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.910 
one on edge because here's another deep
target<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:46.049> the<00:00:46.320> red<00:00:46.500> marker

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
target right and when the red marker

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.219 
target right and when the red marker
here<00:00:47.780> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.460> there's<00:00:50.460> also<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
here you can see that there's also a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.789 
here you can see that there's also a
similar-sounding<00:00:52.229> target<00:00:52.909> see<00:00:53.909> here<00:00:54.799> and

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
similar-sounding target see here and

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.590 
similar-sounding target see here and
here<00:00:57.199> anyway<00:00:58.250> well<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.670> seed<00:00:59.909> is<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.150> wasn't

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
here anyway well the seed is it wasn't

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
here anyway well the seed is it wasn't
just<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:02.809> let<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.260> try<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.369> tone

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
just to see let me just try to tone

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
just to see let me just try to tone
ferrous<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.960> gives<00:01:07.200> us<00:01:07.350> any<00:01:07.500> more

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
ferrous to see if that gives us any more

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:37.220 
ferrous to see if that gives us any more
information<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:31.400> little<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:33.350> lot<00:01:36.230> and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
information here little bit of a lot and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.780 
information here little bit of a lot and
not<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.620> much<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.980> target<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.580> left

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
not so much on the target to the left

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
not so much on the target to the left
anyway<00:01:39.780> let's<00:01:40.020> try<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> stock<00:01:40.590> coil<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
anyway let's try the stock coil and I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.690 
anyway let's try the stock coil and I
just<00:01:41.340> proceed<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:41.760> there

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.179 

okay<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> stock<00:01:46.200> coil<00:01:46.470> manual

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
okay now with the stock coil manual

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.730 
okay now with the stock coil manual
sensitivity<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> 30<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> other<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.330 

not<00:01:55.740> really

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
not really

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.039 
not really
let's<00:01:56.700> try<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> toy<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> above<00:01:58.280> yeah<00:02:00.049> so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
let's try the toy that above yeah so

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.810 
let's try the toy that above yeah so
again<00:02:01.229> maybe<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.860> target<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.520> kind

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
again maybe it's one target that's kind

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.880 
again maybe it's one target that's kind
of<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.030> angle<00:02:04.759> back<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> original<00:02:06.420> target

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
of on angle back to the original target

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.260 
of on angle back to the original target
it's<00:02:07.890> picking<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> up<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> angle<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> bit

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
it's picking it up at this angle a bit

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
it's picking it up at this angle a bit
but<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.989> see<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.319> coming<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.709> at

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
but as you can see it's coming in at

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:39.020 
but as you can see it's coming in at
iron<00:02:11.069> Fe<00:02:11.850> solid<00:02:15.769> 17<00:02:16.769> 26<00:02:17.519> 20<00:02:36.019> let's<00:02:37.519> try<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.580> tone

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
iron Fe solid 17 26 20 let's try to tone

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
iron Fe solid 17 26 20 let's try to tone
ferrous<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.720> by<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.930> way<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> tried<00:02:40.470> manual

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
ferrous and by the way I tried manual

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.080 
ferrous and by the way I tried manual
sensitivity<00:02:42.090> or<00:02:42.209> auto<00:02:42.420> excuse<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:44.090> it's

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
sensitivity or auto excuse me it at it's

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.870 
sensitivity or auto excuse me it at it's
at<00:02:45.209> 16<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.049> hired<00:02:46.290> before<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.160> 13

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
at 16 now it was hired before and the 13

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.160 
at 16 now it was hired before and the 13
inch<00:02:48.000> D<00:02:48.150> Tech<00:02:48.330> wouldn't<00:02:48.690> pick<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.049> at

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
inch D Tech wouldn't pick it up at

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.430 
inch D Tech wouldn't pick it up at
around<00:02:49.350> 20<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:51.090> neither<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.930> stock<00:02:52.230> as

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
around 20 so neither will the stock as
