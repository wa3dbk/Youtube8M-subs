this<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.449> best<00:00:31.410> game<00:00:32.340> mode<00:00:32.610> it's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.530 
this is I think the best game mode it's
really<00:00:33.630> fun<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.309> it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> substitute<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
really fun and it's a substitute to the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.380 
really fun and it's a substitute to the
