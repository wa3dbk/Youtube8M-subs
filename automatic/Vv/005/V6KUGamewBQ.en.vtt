suppose<00:00:41.190> knee<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> instituted<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:45.590> trailer

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.350 

and<00:00:51.430> FPU<00:00:52.430> or<00:00:52.700> Fire<00:00:53.150> Prevention<00:00:53.390> Unit<00:00:55.360> just

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and FPU or Fire Prevention Unit just

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.840 
and FPU or Fire Prevention Unit just
kind<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.750> move<00:00:57.170> those<00:00:57.380> small<00:00:57.710> things<00:00:57.740> and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.380 

reason<00:01:01.850> why<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:02.060> is<00:01:02.360> back<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:02.900> because<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
reason why this is back is because the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.450 
reason why this is back is because the
EMTs<00:01:07.270> parked<00:01:08.270> their<00:01:09.550> ambulance<00:01:10.550> right<00:01:10.729> here

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
EMTs parked their ambulance right here

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.360 
EMTs parked their ambulance right here
it's<00:01:13.460> kind<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.729> hard<00:01:13.910> to<00:01:13.940> get<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:14.360> it's

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
it's kind of hard to get in because it's

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.280 
it's kind of hard to get in because it's
exactly<00:01:16.370> eight<00:01:16.640> step<00:01:17.000> stunt<00:01:17.900> applied<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:20.290> i'm

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
exactly eight step stunt applied so i'm

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.370 
exactly eight step stunt applied so i'm
probably<00:01:21.560> moving<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.430> back<00:01:22.759> there<00:01:23.380> that

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
probably moving this back there that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.760 
probably moving this back there that
right<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:24.850> let's<00:01:25.850> go<00:01:26.090> be<00:01:26.300> better<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:27.560> yeah
