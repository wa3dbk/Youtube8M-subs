00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
economy running so I said all right

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.960 
economy running so I said all right
and<00:00:15.420> then<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:16.289> gave<00:00:17.220> small<00:00:17.670> engine<00:00:17.880> mechanic

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
and then I I gave small engine mechanic

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.439 
and then I I gave small engine mechanic
Mike<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> call<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.470> hear<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.880> few<00:00:21.060> things<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
of them guys came over to help me try

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.630 
of them guys came over to help me try
and<00:00:26.519> start<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.910> thing<00:00:27.830> put<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.920> magneto<00:00:29.340> on

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and start this thing put the magneto on

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.510 
and start this thing put the magneto on
here<00:00:31.399> and<00:00:33.469> fabricated<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> bracket<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
here and fabricated a bracket for it I

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.650 
here and fabricated a bracket for it I
just<00:00:35.910> feel<00:00:36.090> around<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.660> oops

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
just feel around here oops

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.030 
just feel around here oops
you<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> shiny<00:00:40.350> sober<00:00:40.800> thing<00:00:40.950> i

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you see that shiny sober thing i

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
you see that shiny sober thing i
fabricated<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:44.120> so<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.329> hook<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
fabricated that so we can hook this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.979 
fabricated that so we can hook this
mechanism<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.510> see<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.629> could<00:00:48.780> spin

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
mechanism up here see if I could spin

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.580 
mechanism up here see if I could spin
the<00:00:49.079> engine<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.739> my<00:00:49.860> other<00:00:50.160> hand

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
the engine here with my other hand

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.850 
the engine here with my other hand
moving<00:00:52.590> my<00:00:52.680> camera<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> see

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
moving my camera here so you can see

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.410 
moving my camera here so you can see
what<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.129> thing's<00:00:56.340> supposed<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
what this thing's supposed to do like to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.180 
what this thing's supposed to do like to
turn<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> flywheel<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.530> that's<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.949> comes

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
turn the flywheel and that's thing comes

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.450 
turn the flywheel and that's thing comes
up<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.739> trigger<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
up it's a little trigger and it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
up it's a little trigger and it's
supposed<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.790> give<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.060> spark<00:01:06.920> on<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.100> spark

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
supposed to give you a spark on a spark

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
supposed to give you a spark on a spark
plug<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.850> that's<00:01:09.000> why<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.540> spin<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
plug in here that's why I can spin this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.530 
plug in here that's why I can spin this
with<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.409> hand<00:01:13.670> but<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.820> happened<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.240> that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
with one hand but what happened is that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.210 
with one hand but what happened is that
we're<00:01:15.689> getting<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:15.930> erratic<00:01:16.380> spark<00:01:16.740> sometime

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
we're getting an erratic spark sometime

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
we're getting an erratic spark sometime
in<00:01:17.369> sports<00:01:17.640> sometimes<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.119> wasn't<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:21.350> these

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
in sports sometimes it wasn't and these

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
in sports sometimes it wasn't and these
flywheels<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.100> 50<00:01:23.400> 60<00:01:23.700> pounds<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.090> piece

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
flywheels are like 50 60 pounds of piece

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.630 
flywheels are like 50 60 pounds of piece
and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> got<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.280> spark<00:01:26.280> plug<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and then when you got the spark plug in

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.039 
and then when you got the spark plug in
there<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> got<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> hundred<00:01:27.390> fifty<00:01:27.720> sixty

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
there you got a hundred fifty sixty

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
there you got a hundred fifty sixty
pounds<00:01:28.350> compression<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.150> it's<00:01:30.150> pretty<00:01:30.360> tough

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pounds compression and it's pretty tough

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.490 
pounds compression and it's pretty tough
to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.520> little<00:01:35.520> racer<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.060> mike<00:01:36.500> each

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to do so a little racer and mike each

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.649 
to do so a little racer and mike each
one<00:01:37.680> time<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.189> 25<00:01:38.610> miles<00:01:38.850> away<00:01:39.030> they

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
one time was about 25 miles away they

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
one time was about 25 miles away they
came<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.640> we<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.729> worked<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.150> for

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
came over here and we all worked on for

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.880 
came over here and we all worked on for
about<00:01:42.630> three<00:01:43.290> hours<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:45.619> they<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
about three hours and they got it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.749 
about three hours and they got it
running<00:01:47.750> but<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:48.960> running<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.759> real

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
running but it was running a real

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.929 
running but it was running a real
erratic<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:53.159> was<00:01:53.310> jumping<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.820> down

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
erratic and it was jumping up and down

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
erratic and it was jumping up and down
and<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.869> wasn't<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.200> wasn't<00:01:55.320> right<00:01:55.560> something

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and it wasn't it wasn't right something

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
and it wasn't it wasn't right something
just<00:01:56.040> wasn't<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> little<00:01:58.079> bit

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just wasn't right but I got a little bit

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.330 
just wasn't right but I got a little bit
of<00:01:58.380> video<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.219> much<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> still

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of video of it but not much so I still

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889 
of video of it but not much so I still
think<00:02:02.490> we<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.700> problem<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.509> problem<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
think we have a problem the problem is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
think we have a problem the problem is
just<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.350> magneto<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.040> put<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.340> there<00:02:05.579> what

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
just this magneto we put on there what

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.180 
just this magneto we put on there what
we're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:07.020> cuz<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.009> was<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
we're going to do is cuz that that was a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.859 
we're going to do is cuz that that was a
spark<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.789> output<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.360> footage<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.780> here

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
spark and I output some footage in here

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.300 
spark and I output some footage in here
show<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.349> know<00:02:10.440> something<00:02:10.800> sometimes<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
show you you know something sometimes it
