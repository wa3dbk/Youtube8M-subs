00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.130 
thinking together the two tracks are
things<00:01:45.039> together<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.149> unfortunately<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:46.959> don't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
things together so unfortunately I don't

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.320 
things together so unfortunately I don't
have<00:01:47.259> any<00:01:47.350> song<00:01:47.800> here<00:01:48.190> because<00:01:49.000> it's<00:01:49.119> very

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
have any song here because it's very

loud at the music Messer but I can

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.930 
loud at the music Messer but I can
guarantee<00:01:51.789> this<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.869> thing<00:01:53.440> together

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
guarantee this this is thing together

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.820 
guarantee this this is thing together
here<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.030> have<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.360> mixers<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:56.050> central<00:01:56.470> mixer

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
here you have the mixers a central mixer

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.410 
here you have the mixers a central mixer
so<00:01:57.310> when<00:01:57.459> you<00:01:57.550> put<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.910> finger<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.390> know

so when you put the finger you know

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.139 
so when you put the finger you know
exactly<00:01:58.929> where<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.770> position<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.670> your
