00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:11.400
 simcity the return of a classic 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 We were treated by a chronic doctor 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.790
 closed beta invited 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.070
 So you have already checked in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.770
 Play a bit and I'll show you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 now the first steps in the new 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.430
 I said the first part of the city 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 There were various other city 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.830
 sometimes already share eg city 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 2000 one of probably the best they have to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.960
 the games what emerged from it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.379
 is the extremely popular series the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.329
 sims and now it's easy reboot 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.379
 the sim city without number without year number 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.129
 something comes to nothing without a game 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.079
 in March 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.899
 now there are but first ne beta 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.739
 version and it just looks on it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.829
 we already have a bit 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.070
 start playing here 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.690
 the first 17 moved in 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.049
 we already have several of them 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 industry up here we have 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.900
 There are commercial areas over here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.880
 see a wind power plant we have the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.619
 people are supplied with water and we have 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 already built our town hall 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.009
 that's not really what happened to us 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.409
 now have about ten minutes 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.180
 played before this video starts playing 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.430
 means it is actually opened 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.619
 leisurely state but you too 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.110
 no matter what this may may be 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.990
 mean that actually are pretty 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.430
 they are happy they have electricity on the water 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.439
 and supply is quasi secured and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.729
 they can move in 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.549
 Down here do not live on the mouse pointer 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 you can see where exactly what you are looking for 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.750
 just needed is the building land so 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.880
 especially the industry wishes 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.960
 That's why I'll show you more land now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 how to do that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.360
 First of all, you have to build a street 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.149
 we'll just stop here now 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 rectangular piece and fill this 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.600
 piece with yellow color quasi from this 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.800
 yellow color means only that 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.540
 is young 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.010
 that means that here may the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 settle industry 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.160
 That's why we do not settle here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.680
 People do everything ourselves as we do 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.380
 mayors just say where that goes 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.140
 the demand continues to rise but she 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.880
 although find out more here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.240
 space was created and needs it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.270
 from the living room also needs that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.160
 one is called the same again in the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:36.440
 fast passage for flats we have 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.270
 the green market around living space to the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.700
 By the way, taxes are very good 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.320
 nimbly solved with wsa we can 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.180
 Just move us over the value here 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.620
 with mausrad we can scroll 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:56.460
 scroll and the left mouse button allowed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.270
 Turning the field what could 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.840
 we still have to make meanwhile 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.280
 some people here like you 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.490
 certainly one or the other 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.140
 child that means it would be 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.270
 Maybe not bad to say 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 do a school the cost sees 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.380
 price 16,000 simons this is the currency 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 in here 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.060
 We still have 27,000 on the account 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.910
 currently no problem on the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.959
 best somewhere near by 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 residential area so that the kids are not so 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.980
 far 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:32.540
 have the schools and let's go 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.330
 Let's go back to the moment 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.130
 be sought to teachers it is 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.470
 show this little information pack 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.030
 incidentally say suspected of 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:53.780
 Director explains that children are the little ones 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:56.000
 are flower and otherwise we can still 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.130
 Of course, many more are being built in the near future 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.760
 Time is off with one 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.490
 Police Station Fire Department, of course 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.900
 in the hospital a garbage collection and 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.810
 of course, too, and that will 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.330
 now yellow set a sewage 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.400
 a sewage pump with it if sewage 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.100
 insist that pumping is also over 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.660
 now this brown blob is that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.420
 all wastewater so far 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.340
 confession in the city and now through 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.180
 The pump now really nice 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.930
 sucked and thus the city is right 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.030
 not and the sims are in the moment 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.210
 she is not really happy because of me 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.750
 just that happens then passes over 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.750
 if purpose is 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:53.950
 those were the first scenes of simcity 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.300
 as I said several other things 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.650
 What we do not care about you right now 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.460
 We can show local traffic 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.030
 can tinker surgeries we can 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.610
 natural disaster over our city 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.160
 let possibilities come in without 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.400
 The End 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.020
 the beta is relatively short there is not 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.340
 I see much too much more than that 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.580
 that's after an hour 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.169
 Automatically the city so far the game 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.240
 completed and the city is lost 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.710
 we do not save that that means a lot 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.940
 more than that, they create similar and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.600
 as you can see here, he finds 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.960
 not three today they are like 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.550
 said in march for the pc is at amazon 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.430
 already preorderable 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.110
 who have a bit more insight 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.300
 we want to have a photo gallery for you 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.330
 provided where we chip city for you 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.770
 build up 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.800
 Our short conclusion we had in the 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.150
 beta is a lot of fun we think 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.740
 could be interesting game 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.050
 could be good is technically up 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.570
 a good level 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.150
 we will see what was played later 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:06:00.190
 shows traditionally with time 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.150
 more complex and until then we have 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.840
 a little fun again 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.740
 Play a bit wisely and be happy 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.740
 ever to the final version
