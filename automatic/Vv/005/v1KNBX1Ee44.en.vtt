00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 we will soon have been alone my name is 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.350
 nothing toulouse before and today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.960
 we clarify the following and not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.849
 I find my wine bottle like you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.309
 We know we have now on the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.350
 most bottles screw cap that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 It also fingernail friendly and indeed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.820
 you just turn around like that then 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.500
 and then you can do it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 continue to enjoy 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 now we have a bottle here and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 Although funny with a cork and if 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 We are lucky enough to be such a waiter 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.010
 knife 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.899
 what has this 2 angles here that helps 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.829
 us the two-year-old and then chamber 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.440
 nice turn and if you are not that much 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:53.510
 force has so how do you get the bottle 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:59.579
 even so that would be the case then 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 we have such a knox here for it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.880
 you would actually need a pretty 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.180
 Maybe then muscular man 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.659
 the goal 1 turns and then just that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 bottle also opens up force 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.299
 as I said this is all not there should 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.390
 this part here that is I do not know 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.780
 Whether base to hang lamps my team 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.240
 could not say what that means 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.770
 that is or screw with such a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 hang and was 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.710
 and that should work that way 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.189
 it was a screwed and then you could 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.210
 practically open the bottle 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.890
 he promises me what makes this shoe 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.810
 here because this thing with 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.540
 that is the shoe of mine 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.490
 it will change in the coming years 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.030
 fly out of the window like the last one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 work is needed now and it should be 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.170
 following works that one the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.270
 bottles it the way in shiraz 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.840
 favorite species stuck in the school 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.730
 The show will be knocked on the wall 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.739
 and then to the bottle on we go 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.269
 will try the same 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.640
 I do not think so 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.620
 but it works either 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.630
 broken bottle that would be a pity or 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:36.390
 The school then throw at the pool 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:37.099
 you had to use resources in the bottle too 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:48.630
 hew 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:50.250
 so not in the sandstones so me 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.380
 I just got enlightened that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.660
 normally these would cost 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.100
 one should reasonably be outside 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.230
 many times already knock out hand again 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.510
 but that's just what I get 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.010
 late 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 Thank you so much I looked 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.350
 Hope he also has a bit of fun 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.260
 with me and now you know how to get one 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.239
 bottle of wine just opens without a partner 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.910
