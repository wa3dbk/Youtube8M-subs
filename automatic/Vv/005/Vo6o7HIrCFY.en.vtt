00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello welcome today we are going to see another 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.529
 new way to obtain passive income 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.570
 that would be good real estate 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.099
 first let's remember what are the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.780
 passive income passive income 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.150
 they are incomes that demand us at the beginning 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.620
 a lot of work but then they arrive 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.650
 income without working 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.800
 How can we convert buying and selling? 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.380
 of houses in passive income 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.340
 the purchase of a house becomes a 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 passive income when and only if the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.040
 we buy in order to do business 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 nowadays you do not need to have much 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.240
 money to have possession of a house 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.820
 since there are mortgage loans 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.130
 and good as we enter the credits 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.480
 mortgages let's see the way 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.100
 correct to use them 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.470
 the first point would be the following 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.260
 we have to choose a house that is 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.239
 striking that has a good point that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.760
 is ideal to live that any 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.989
 person is interested in being able to rent 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.930
 which is a property that has this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.030
 good point services fences you have 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.640
 various comforts that make her grow 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.369
 in value and that is more striking for 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.800
 to be able to live good since we have located 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.880
 In the house we wanted to buy, let's go 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.520
 with point number 2 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.800
 point number 2 would be to go to a bank and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
 get a mortgage and good credit 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.740
 to get that mortgage loan 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.380
 you need to have a minimum income 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.670
 depending on each good bank since 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.610
 you have approved the mortgage credit 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.320
 we go to point number 3 what goes to 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 to do is to buy the house with that credit 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.360
 mortgage and you will rent it clear for 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 to be able to do this necessary to do the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.950
 point number 1 very well since you're 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.200
 have an income higher than your credit 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.720
 mortgage for example if your credit is 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 of 4 thousand 500 you would need to rent the in 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.430
 about 5,000 and you would have an income 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.130
 passive of 500 pesos 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.800
 Now you are surely saying 500 pesos 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.080
 well it's not much for so much trouble and 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.180
 well the point is 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.050
 that doing it this way we can 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.050
 do it several times 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.990
 since if we go back to ask for another credit 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.420
 to the bank, the safest thing is that if you do not 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.280
 they see good because it is sure that they give us 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 the second good credit if for the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.040
 first credit we had to have a 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.020
 income of 10 thousand pesos for example if 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.940
 everything did not go perfectly as we have 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.550
 planned to buy the house for rent 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.650
 we have a flow of 500 pesos 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.040
 now our income would be 10 thousand 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.890
 500 the bank that will authorize that credit 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.260
 you can buy another house and go back to 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.760
 do the same procedure and well that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.770
 is another way to make passive income 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.450
 this can be repeated several times 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.010
 depending on your ambitions 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 well I hope you liked this

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.000
 a lot to be able to continue uploading videos
