have your sensor right here I think this

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.270 
have your sensor right here I think this
is<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.600> microphone<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.049> speaker<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
is your microphone and speaker this

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.630 
is your microphone and speaker this
could<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> speaker<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> am<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.899> sure<00:01:43.229> but

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
could be the speaker I am not sure but

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.120 
could be the speaker I am not sure but
it<00:01:44.640> takes<00:01:44.909> four<00:01:45.299> double<00:01:45.750> A<00:01:45.840> batteries<00:01:46.130> right

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

here your on/off button I guess this is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
here your on/off button I guess this is
for<00:01:49.710> charging<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.460> might<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.850> built-in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
for charging there might be a built-in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.670 
for charging there might be a built-in
battery<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.229> here

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
battery in here
