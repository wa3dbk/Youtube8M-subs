00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello and welcome back to one 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.750
 another injured 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.290
 yes we are back on the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.269
 fag 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.190
 I really wanted to send here now 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.359
 crash at the crash tests do it all 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 with 50 km but as you can see 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.080
 ueberroth this motto just goes with it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.189
 Not like me again 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.980
 yesterday she was still working halfway 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.090
 and now it does not work again 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.969
 make a fucking program because of that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.149
 we just do everything a bit differently 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.170
 become 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.160
 they could thus try 50 against 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
 to drive but of course you could 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.370
 not exactly determined would one unite 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 not always ask to 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.730
 that could be boring and, above all, boring 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.780
 I have no bock it 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.699
 By the way, thanks to all the me 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.180
 have written something for me so 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.949
 yes more than display is so unique 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.420
 who will be applying soon ? 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.330
 Send it in and then I'll tell you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.880
 What it is, if it works, I hope 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.480
 that it would work now 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.410
 just too short here 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.410
 as in good old times 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.130
 does go on a bit sore 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 or I find there to drive to where 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.869
 are you exactly we did not have all yet 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 race today already the rays variant can 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
 I know now with times catch up 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.830
 yes I think we already had 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.700
 listen once now search now always short 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.240
 then we can the sport variant 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.240
 do 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.220
 on 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:15.440
 then high and Roetgen matter make sport 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.020
 okay, that does not go quite so fast 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.010
 but 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.010
 although better for it 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:35.239
 we can create and become that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.519
 lost our mirror and put there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.040
 front okay that's acceptable and that 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.220
 thing is on and slowly 110 degrees 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:49.790
 more quickly 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.290
 where can you stand up there then no pain 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.640
 is becoming much I say do what 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.640
 to take new cars 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.250
 why not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.379
 no left left for close 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.269
 By the way, today comes the first part of the 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.269
 fifa 14 series 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:30.730
 a cookie is quite funny and wanted 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.230
 I prefer to say I do not know 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.819
 Not a single thing today because I was back then 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.260
 somehow i cant offer that because i can 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.689
 then somehow do differently 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.140
 so just open it sometime today 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.470
 I invite the first match fifa to the channel 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.819
 against the high good 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.450
 now we're just good times with 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.790
 continue driving our vehicle thus 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.319
 small stylish camera ride allowed 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.099
 of course, so rather say no missing 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.099
 tracking shot 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:09.750
 so perfect so super beautiful 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.650
 around which I would do so now 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.910
 as did not have the desired result 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.230
 I would really mind so 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.019
 but then it has to be 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:23.560
 sometimes overturned 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.850
 so weird dented ok I have to 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.690
 Cover the whole vehicle 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.820
 then at the golf and so we have long 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.410
 not when around the 1940 cadillac 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.810
 actually deserves the first time for 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.750
 google I believe now first 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.960
 automat is understandable his car and 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.270
 old part again for it eats the 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.580
 difference between playable and so 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:59.550
 between fluid and jerky age 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.550
 made the wirt very bad 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.190
 if we just put it here so nice 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.190
 against popping 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.600
 but he looks good 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.540
 consequently , white people were attacking for 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.540
 itself and follows almost perfectly written 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.400
 it's a little bit weird 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.240
 But car falls on someone determined 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:32.000
 the front there is only something but one 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.000
 A little more striking is this accident 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:39.659
 so the field I have a bit now 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:45.530
 more on it is still the car can like 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:47.550
 another car bent at the back 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.970
 I have not damaged but now 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.970
 like it 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:01.560
 bora bora bora bora 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:04.159
 jurassic watt admit I always take 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.159
 have made 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.340
 Oh oh 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.340
 so 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:25.979
 Ford up to 15,000 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.979
 turns per minute fell 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:38.250
 yes now we fly now we die 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.870
 so now make current turns yes 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.550
 that would be a bit further back or 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.400
 dented right then it would have 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:48.150
 Maybe when the forces are there 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.020
 would have survived but not like that 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:55.860
 I know that something was gone, yes she was 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.300
 evil flew and surprisingly little 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.520
 Damage to the car would have thought that 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:11.400
 We shot you like that, but not me 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:12.110
 much but first turn right turn left 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.720
 flashes 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:19.310
 but when is the front actually here 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.310
 turn signal also below 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.170
 yes well I what to release the recording 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.620
 interrupt and we'll be right back 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.620
 see you soon
