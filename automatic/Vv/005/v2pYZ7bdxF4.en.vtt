00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
day I do have an opinion on this one on

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.850 
day I do have an opinion on this one on
the<00:00:15.949> total<00:00:16.730> AFC<00:00:17.300> playing<00:00:17.630> NFC<00:00:18.200> and<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:18.590> anyone

the total AFC playing NFC and so anyone

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.380 
the total AFC playing NFC and so anyone
who's<00:00:19.010> been<00:00:19.160> following<00:00:19.580> us<00:00:19.700> probably<00:00:20.090> knows

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
who's been following us probably knows

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.870 
who's been following us probably knows
which<00:00:20.630> way<00:00:20.810> I'm<00:00:20.990> going<00:00:21.230> on<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:21.500> game<00:00:21.740> lack<00:00:22.700> of

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
which way I'm going on this game lack of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.700 
which way I'm going on this game lack of
familiarity<00:00:23.240> usually<00:00:23.870> means<00:00:24.080> more<00:00:24.380> scoring

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
familiarity usually means more scoring

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.460 
familiarity usually means more scoring
but<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.250> know<00:00:26.210> Dallas<00:00:26.540> can't<00:00:26.870> buy<00:00:26.990> any<00:00:27.110> defense

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
but I know Dallas can't buy any defense

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.800 
but I know Dallas can't buy any defense
Brady<00:00:27.770> can<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.220> can<00:00:28.670> Oakland<00:00:29.030> score<00:00:29.420> against

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
Brady can and can Oakland score against

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.029 
Brady can and can Oakland score against
that<00:00:29.960> defense<00:00:30.320> that<00:00:30.410> everyone<00:00:30.740> else<00:00:30.830> is

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
that defense that everyone else is

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.040 
that defense that everyone else is
scoring<00:00:31.400> against<00:00:31.700> yeah<00:00:31.910> absolutely<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.720> think

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
scoring against yeah absolutely I think

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.380 
scoring against yeah absolutely I think
they<00:00:33.170> can<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.620> Oakland's<00:00:34.550> offense<00:00:34.910> sputters

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
they can and Oakland's offense sputters

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.420 
they can and Oakland's offense sputters
a<00:00:35.420> little<00:00:35.750> bit<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:36.680> don't<00:00:36.800> like<00:00:37.130> him<00:00:37.340> as

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
a little bit and I don't like him as

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.250 
a little bit and I don't like him as
much<00:00:37.670> without<00:00:37.880> prior<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.690> game<00:00:38.930> because<00:00:39.230> I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
much without prior in the game because I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.140 
much without prior in the game because I
think<00:00:39.530> his<00:00:39.680> running<00:00:40.040> element<00:00:40.489> really<00:00:40.640> adds<00:00:41.000> a

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
think his running element really adds a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.210 
think his running element really adds a
lot<00:00:41.180> to<00:00:41.510> this<00:00:41.630> team<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:42.200> saw<00:00:42.410> we<00:00:43.190> saw

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
lot to this team and we saw we saw

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.250 
lot to this team and we saw we saw
Tennessee<00:00:43.850> take<00:00:44.060> advantage<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.780> last<00:00:44.989> week

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
Tennessee take advantage of it last week

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.229 
Tennessee take advantage of it last week
a<00:00:45.380> low-scoring<00:00:45.590> game<00:00:46.190> out<00:00:46.370> there<00:00:46.610> in<00:00:46.790> Oakland

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
a low-scoring game out there in Oakland

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.180 
a low-scoring game out there in Oakland
where<00:00:47.450> again<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.260> Oakland<00:00:48.590> offense<00:00:48.950> really

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
where again the Oakland offense really

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.040 
where again the Oakland offense really
couldn't<00:00:49.579> get<00:00:49.670> going<00:00:50.060> now<00:00:50.210> Tennessee's

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
couldn't get going now Tennessee's

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.229 
couldn't get going now Tennessee's
defense<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:51.649> lot<00:00:51.920> better<00:00:52.160> than<00:00:52.250> Dallas's<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
defense is a lot better than Dallas's so

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.540 
defense is a lot better than Dallas's so
yeah<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.020> would<00:00:54.230> expect<00:00:54.770> some<00:00:54.950> scoring<00:00:55.340> here

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
yeah I would expect some scoring here

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.430 
yeah I would expect some scoring here
Dallas<00:00:55.790> coming<00:00:56.270> off<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:56.450> that<00:00:56.720> huge<00:00:57.050> victory

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
Dallas coming off of that huge victory

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.380 
Dallas coming off of that huge victory
over<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.829> Giants<00:00:58.309> we<00:00:58.460> know<00:00:58.640> how<00:00:58.820> they<00:00:58.940> perform

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
over the Giants we know how they perform

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.020 
over the Giants we know how they perform
at<00:00:59.510> home<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.020> had<00:01:00.380> expect<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.250> defense<00:01:01.730> to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
at home I had expect that defense to

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.119 
at home I had expect that defense to
regress<00:01:02.660> a<00:01:02.690> little<00:01:03.020> bit<00:01:03.200> yeah<00:01:03.590> well<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:04.040> know

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
regress a little bit yeah well you know

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.320 
regress a little bit yeah well you know
you<00:01:04.220> said<00:01:04.460> low<00:01:04.670> scoring<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:05.150> interesting

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
you said low scoring it's interesting

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.080 
you said low scoring it's interesting
because<00:01:05.659> it's<00:01:06.080> amazingly<00:01:07.040> like<00:01:07.250> total<00:01:07.909> in<00:01:08.000> the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
with all that are the the Oakland locker

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.210 
with all that are the the Oakland locker
room<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.470> mean<00:01:21.619> obviously<00:01:21.740> they<00:01:22.100> weren't

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
room I mean obviously they weren't

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.250 
room I mean obviously they weren't
expected<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.850> be<00:01:22.940> very<00:01:23.150> good<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:23.540> year<00:01:23.869> they

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
expected to be very good this year they

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.440 
expected to be very good this year they
played<00:01:24.530> pretty<00:01:24.799> capably<00:01:25.430> I<00:01:25.520> would<00:01:25.760> say<00:01:25.970> based

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
played pretty capably I would say based

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.870 
played pretty capably I would say based
on<00:01:26.600> par<00:01:27.290> they<00:01:27.470> happy<00:01:27.830> there<00:01:28.010> I<00:01:28.159> think<00:01:28.700> maybe

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
on par they happy there I think maybe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.789 
on par they happy there I think maybe
they've<00:01:29.150> exceeded<00:01:29.540> expectations<00:01:30.439> a<00:01:30.590> little

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
they've exceeded expectations a little

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.410 
they've exceeded expectations a little
bit<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.310> don't<00:01:31.369> know<00:01:31.580> what<00:01:31.760> their<00:01:31.909> season<00:01:32.270> 1

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
bit and I don't know what their season 1

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.690 
bit and I don't know what their season 1

win total at the start of the year was

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.850 
win total at the start of the year was
but<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.869> know<00:01:35.960> their<00:01:36.140> defense<00:01:36.530> is<00:01:36.710> pretty

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
but you know their defense is pretty

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.130 
but you know their defense is pretty
darn<00:01:37.189> good<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.729> as<00:01:37.939> evidenced<00:01:38.540> by<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.720> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
darn good and as evidenced by the the

darn good and as evidenced by the the
total<00:01:39.830> in<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.040> score<00:01:40.340> last<00:01:41.030> week<00:01:41.270> against

Tennessee<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.009> think<00:01:43.250> prior<00:01:43.490> like<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:44.000> said

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
Tennessee and I think prior like we said

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.390 
Tennessee and I think prior like we said
adds<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:44.630> real<00:01:44.840> element<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.380> their<00:01:45.500> offense<00:01:45.920> now

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
adds a real element to their offense now

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.969 
adds a real element to their offense now
they've<00:01:47.180> had<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.780> receiver<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.380> believe<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.830> was

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
they've had a receiver I believe it was

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.190 
they've had a receiver I believe it was
I'm<00:01:49.790> trying<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.119> think<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.479> which<00:01:50.600> receiver<00:01:51.080> I

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
I'm trying to think of which receiver I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.200 
I'm trying to think of which receiver I
thought<00:01:51.500> was<00:01:51.650> out<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.950> game<00:01:52.130> for<00:01:52.850> Oakland

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
thought was out of the game for Oakland

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.609 
thought was out of the game for Oakland
last<00:01:53.390> week<00:01:53.630> I'm<00:01:53.750> not<00:01:53.780> sure<00:01:54.140> if<00:01:54.229> he'll<00:01:54.350> be<00:01:54.500> in

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
last week I'm not sure if he'll be in

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.460 
last week I'm not sure if he'll be in
the<00:01:54.740> mix<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.189> week<00:01:55.540> but<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.079> know<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.200> think

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
the mix this week but you know I think

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.890 
the mix this week but you know I think
Mackenzie<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.670> GM<00:01:59.000> rolls<00:01:59.299> doing<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.720> great

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
Mackenzie and the GM rolls doing a great

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.219 
Mackenzie and the GM rolls doing a great
job

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
job

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.630 
job
I<00:02:00.409> think<00:02:00.590> Dennis<00:02:00.829> Allen's<00:02:01.159> doing<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> nice<00:02:01.610> job

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
I think Dennis Allen's doing a nice job

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.580 
I think Dennis Allen's doing a nice job
as<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.180> coach<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.840> would<00:02:03.140> expect<00:02:03.439> this

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
as the coach and I would expect this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.590 
as the coach and I would expect this
team<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.950> draft<00:02:04.220> pretty<00:02:04.520> well<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.180> would

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
team to draft pretty well and I would

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.840 
team to draft pretty well and I would
say<00:02:05.840> maybe<00:02:06.020> 2<00:02:06.350> years<00:02:06.380> from<00:02:06.740> now<00:02:06.950> even<00:02:07.640> next

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
say maybe 2 years from now even next

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.460 
say maybe 2 years from now even next
year<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.179> ought<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.300> be<00:02:08.479> competitive<00:02:08.840> but<00:02:09.259> I

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
year they ought to be competitive but I

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.839 
year they ought to be competitive but I
think<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.830> Raiders<00:02:10.130> are<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.310> their<00:02:10.550> way<00:02:10.670> back

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
think the Raiders are on their way back

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.390 
think the Raiders are on their way back
who<00:02:11.840> wins<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.260> division<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> east

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
who wins the division in the east

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.949 
who wins the division in the east
and<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.580> NSC<00:02:13.819> gonna<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.269> fill<00:02:14.659> we<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:14.870> gonna

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
and the NSC gonna be fill we are gonna

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.449 
and the NSC gonna be fill we are gonna
be<00:02:15.170> Dallas<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.890> think<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.670> Dallas<00:02:17.090> hmm<00:02:17.810> I

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
be Dallas I think it's Dallas hmm I

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.100 
be Dallas I think it's Dallas hmm I
think<00:02:19.459> they're<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.700> better<00:02:19.849> team<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.780> Philly

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
think they're the better team and Philly

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.320 
think they're the better team and Philly
certainly<00:02:21.650> has<00:02:21.799> improved<00:02:22.250> Nick<00:02:22.670> Foles<00:02:22.909> is<00:02:23.120> but

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
certainly has improved Nick Foles is but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.839 
certainly has improved Nick Foles is but
has<00:02:23.810> been<00:02:23.989> great<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> still<00:02:24.709> think<00:02:25.250> Dallas

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
has been great but I still think Dallas

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.030 
has been great but I still think Dallas
is<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.390> superior<00:02:26.870> team<00:02:27.110> very<00:02:27.530> good<00:02:27.709> one

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
is the superior team very good one

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.649 
is the superior team very good one
on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.489> side<00:02:28.909> I<00:02:28.940> really<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.420> any

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
on the side I really don't have any

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.020 
on the side I really don't have any
opinion<00:02:29.840> on<00:02:30.079> this<00:02:30.200> one<00:02:30.409> but<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.799> total<00:02:31.159> I<00:02:31.310> I

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
opinion on this one but on the total I I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
opinion on this one but on the total I I
do<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.720> over<00:02:32.989> typically<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.709> when<00:02:33.829> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
do like the over typically like when the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.130 
do like the over typically like when the
AFC<00:02:34.220> plays<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.640> NFC<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.569> go<00:02:35.690> ahead<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:35.989> go

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
AFC plays the NFC to go ahead and go

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
AFC plays the NFC to go ahead and go
over<00:02:36.370> concern<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.579> little<00:02:37.819> bit<00:02:37.909> of<00:02:37.940> a

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
over concern with a little bit of a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.600 
over concern with a little bit of a
short<00:02:38.299> time<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.900> prepare<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:39.590> let<00:02:40.340> me<00:02:40.430> make<00:02:40.549> a

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
short time to prepare but let me make a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.880 
short time to prepare but let me make a
case<00:02:40.909> that<00:02:41.510> probably<00:02:41.930> makes<00:02:42.140> more<00:02:42.230> case<00:02:42.650> that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
case that probably makes more case that

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.319 
case that probably makes more case that
the<00:02:42.980> defense<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.459> not<00:02:43.489> gonna<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:43.879> able<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.060> stop

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
the defense is not gonna be able to stop

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.789 
the defense is not gonna be able to stop
anybody<00:02:44.750> right<00:02:45.049> let's<00:02:45.230> let<00:02:45.379> me<00:02:45.440> go<00:02:45.530> ahead<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
anybody right let's let me go ahead and

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.500 
anybody right let's let me go ahead and
make<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.069> official<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.640> I'll<00:02:46.819> give<00:02:47.329> some

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510

big part of my handicap here is the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.240

everyone<00:03:20.930> who<00:03:21.019> caught<00:03:21.169> the<00:03:21.319> weather<00:03:21.470> report

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
everyone who caught the weather report

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.559 
everyone who caught the weather report
hit<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.130> middle<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.760> game<00:03:23.060> but<00:03:23.419> that

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
hit the middle on the game but that

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.390 
hit the middle on the game but that
really<00:03:23.750> kept<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.260> scoring<00:03:24.709> down<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.099> I<00:03:25.160> think

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
really kept the scoring down and I think

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.849 
really kept the scoring down and I think
it<00:03:25.609> disguised<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.720> fact<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.079> this<00:03:27.230> Dallas

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
it disguised the fact that this Dallas

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.150 
it disguised the fact that this Dallas
defense<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:29.060> really<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:30.440> struggling

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
defense is really really struggling

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.039 
defense is really really struggling
they've<00:03:31.730> got<00:03:31.910> all<00:03:32.030> their<00:03:32.150> defensive<00:03:32.629> linemen

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
they've got all their defensive linemen

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.199 
they've got all their defensive linemen
are<00:03:33.169> injured<00:03:33.530> they<00:03:33.739> can't<00:03:34.220> stop<00:03:34.519> anyone<00:03:34.849> right

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
are injured they can't stop anyone right

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.300 
are injured they can't stop anyone right
now<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.660> push<00:03:36.319> came<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.560> shove<00:03:36.709> they<00:03:36.889> couldn't

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
now and push came to shove they couldn't

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.800 
now and push came to shove they couldn't
protect<00:03:37.609> an<00:03:37.730> eight<00:03:37.849> point<00:03:38.030> lead<00:03:38.150> they<00:03:38.629> had<00:03:38.720> to

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
protect an eight point lead they had to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.420 
protect an eight point lead they had to
hand<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.079> over<00:03:39.169> to<00:03:39.319> Tony<00:03:39.560> Romo<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.040> save<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
hand it over to Tony Romo to save the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.939 
hand it over to Tony Romo to save the
game<00:03:40.579> when<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.299> 21<00:03:41.930> all<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.349> surprisingly

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
game when it was 21 all and surprisingly

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.729 
game when it was 21 all and surprisingly
he<00:03:43.250> did<00:03:43.519> indeed<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.629> it<00:03:44.750> done<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.560> think

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
he did indeed get it done and I think

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.259 
he did indeed get it done and I think
the<00:03:45.799> same<00:03:46.010> thing<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.340> true<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.699> Dallas<00:03:47.060> knows

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
the same thing is true that Dallas knows

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.400 
the same thing is true that Dallas knows
they<00:03:47.449> got<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.720> win<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:47.959> game<00:03:48.139> with<00:03:48.290> their

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
they got to win this game with their

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.530 
they got to win this game with their
offense<00:03:48.799> now<00:03:49.400> with<00:03:49.579> their<00:03:49.730> defense<00:03:50.000> we<00:03:50.389> got

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
offense now with their defense we got

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.710 
offense now with their defense we got
two<00:03:50.720> teams<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.560> think<00:03:52.010> are<00:03:52.160> actually

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
two teams that I think are actually

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.030 
two teams that I think are actually
feeling<00:03:53.720> fairly<00:03:54.169> good<00:03:54.379> about<00:03:54.560> themselves

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
feeling fairly good about themselves

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.559 
feeling fairly good about themselves
Dallas<00:03:55.549> off<00:03:55.669> that<00:03:55.879> key<00:03:56.030> win<00:03:56.209> against<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
Dallas off that key win against the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.589 
Dallas off that key win against the
Giants<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.319> I<00:03:57.410> think<00:03:57.470> Oakland<00:03:58.329> maybe<00:03:59.329> they're

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
Giants and I think Oakland maybe they're

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:00.879 
Giants and I think Oakland maybe they're
feeling<00:03:59.840> good<00:03:59.870> about<00:04:00.049> how<00:04:00.230> their<00:04:00.379> season<00:04:00.739> has

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
feeling good about how their season has

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.559 
feeling good about how their season has
gone<00:04:01.069> relatively<00:04:01.699> speaking<00:04:01.970> they've<00:04:02.239> over

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
gone relatively speaking they've over

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.390 
gone relatively speaking they've over
achieved<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.139> little<00:04:03.349> bit<00:04:03.470> as<00:04:03.590> Brady<00:04:03.859> mentioned

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
achieved a little bit as Brady mentioned

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.460 
achieved a little bit as Brady mentioned
but<00:04:04.910> I<00:04:05.180> can't<00:04:05.540> think<00:04:05.780> that<00:04:05.900> they're<00:04:06.049> happy<00:04:06.379> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
but I can't think that they're happy to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.379 
but I can't think that they're happy to
have<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.650> play<00:04:06.889> on<00:04:07.099> Thanksgiving<00:04:07.699> have<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.120> fly

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
have to play on Thanksgiving have to fly

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.539 
have to play on Thanksgiving have to fly
across<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.930> country<00:04:09.260> come<00:04:09.709> into<00:04:09.949> Dallas<00:04:10.340> and

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
across the country come into Dallas and

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.420 
across the country come into Dallas and
my<00:04:11.389> experience<00:04:11.930> has<00:04:12.019> been<00:04:12.049> offensive<00:04:13.040> players

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
my experience has been offensive players

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.550 
my experience has been offensive players
wide<00:04:14.269> receivers<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.750> running<00:04:14.840> backs<00:04:15.049> always

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
wide receivers and running backs always

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.229 
wide receivers and running backs always
bring<00:04:15.829> a<00:04:15.919> hundred<00:04:16.010> percent<00:04:16.310> they<00:04:16.609> always<00:04:16.880> try

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
bring a hundred percent they always try

maybe<00:04:20.299> because<00:04:20.599> partly<00:04:20.840> selfish<00:04:21.260> they<00:04:21.380> want

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
maybe because partly selfish they want

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
to get in the end zone

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.640 
to get in the end zone
it's<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:23.120> lackluster<00:04:23.719> effort<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.169> defense

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
it's that lackluster effort on defense

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.740 
it's that lackluster effort on defense
that<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.550> can<00:04:25.760> show<00:04:25.940> up<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.330> could<00:04:26.539> see
