00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.940 

thought<00:01:53.000> if<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.360> brushed<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.440> looked<00:01:54.830> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
thought if I brushed it and looked a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.389 
thought if I brushed it and looked a
little<00:01:55.100> softer<00:01:56.470> released<00:01:57.470> some<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.979> curls

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
little softer released some of the curls

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.859 
little softer released some of the curls
make<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:58.880> look<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.119> little<00:01:59.300> bit<00:01:59.509> more<00:01:59.690> natural

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
make it look a little bit more natural

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.700 
make it look a little bit more natural
I'm<00:02:00.770> glad<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.550> did<00:02:01.940> this<00:02:02.179> eventually<00:02:02.539> but<00:02:03.350> like

like anything about this way but um
trying<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.470> on<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:57.129> just<00:02:57.340> felt<00:02:57.640> really<00:02:57.849> weird<00:02:58.239> I

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
trying it on it just felt really weird I

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.020 
trying it on it just felt really weird I
think<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.920> was<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.310> fact<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.909> was

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
think it was the fact that it was

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990 
think it was the fact that it was
pre-cut<00:03:01.569> lace<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.190> fit<00:03:03.519> of<00:03:03.549> it<00:03:03.819> just

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
pre-cut lace the the fit of it just

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.199 
pre-cut lace the the fit of it just
really<00:03:04.690> felt<00:03:04.959> uncomfortable<00:03:05.739> as<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:07.060> see

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
really felt uncomfortable as you can see

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.729 
really felt uncomfortable as you can see
I'm<00:03:07.359> struggling<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.200> columns<00:03:08.650> that

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
I'm struggling with the columns that

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.979 
I'm struggling with the columns that
comes<00:03:09.040> were<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.609> too<00:03:09.909> far<00:03:10.180> back<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.810> my

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
comes were just too far back for my

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:11.490 
comes were just too far back for my
liking

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
liking

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.920 
liking
and<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:12.370> didn't<00:03:12.579> feel<00:03:12.730> secure<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.389> just<00:03:13.750> I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
and it didn't feel secure I just I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.690
