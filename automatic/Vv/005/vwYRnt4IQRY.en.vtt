00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.890 
well I believe that can easily be
explained<00:02:54.519> by<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.760> bullet<00:02:55.180> entering<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
explained by a bullet entering and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.449 
explained by a bullet entering and
exiting<00:02:56.019> out<00:02:56.320> of<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.440> hand<00:02:56.739> hitting<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.160> kettle

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
exiting out of the hand hitting a kettle

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.320 
exiting out of the hand hitting a kettle
and<00:02:57.550> hit<00:02:57.700> him<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.910> stomach

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
and hit him in the stomach

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.789 
and hit him in the stomach
sounds<00:02:58.720> like<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.870> Magic<00:02:59.200> Bullet<00:02:59.320> theory<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> me

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799
