00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
proof is in the pudding what is this are

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.930 
proof is in the pudding what is this are
dead<00:01:21.970> or<00:01:22.970> cooking<00:01:23.479> show<00:01:23.780> or<00:01:23.810> what<00:01:24.729> number<00:01:25.729> one

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940

I<00:01:26.209> don't<00:01:27.049> put<00:01:27.200> your<00:01:27.350> proof<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.770> pudding

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
I don't put your proof in the pudding

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.749 
I don't put your proof in the pudding
all<00:01:29.149> right<00:01:29.390> if<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:30.080> have<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.289> nice<00:01:30.560> proof<00:01:30.890> no

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
all right if you have a nice proof no

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.690 
all right if you have a nice proof no
mathematical<00:01:32.630> equations<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:33.770> oh<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.280> know

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
mathematical equations and oh you know

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.180 
mathematical equations and oh you know
watch<00:01:35.179> out<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.929> too<00:01:36.110> new<00:01:36.319> it<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.069> new

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
watch out it is too new it is the new

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.779 
watch out it is too new it is the new
theory<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.789> realization<00:01:38.600> tippity<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:40.579> want

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
theory of realization tippity you want

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.149 
theory of realization tippity you want
to<00:01:40.880> put<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.149> in<00:01:41.270> porting<00:01:41.630> Einstein<00:01:42.159> you'll

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
to put it in porting Einstein you'll

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.590 
to put it in porting Einstein you'll
make<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> guess<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:43.700> what<00:01:44.119> happened<00:01:44.509> in

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
make a guess of what happened in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.200 
make a guess of what happened in
improbable<00:01:45.049> three<00:01:45.649> minutes<00:01:45.979> yeah<00:01:46.789> your<00:01:46.969> proof

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
improbable three minutes yeah your proof

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.420 
improbable three minutes yeah your proof
is<00:01:47.359> now<00:01:47.539> inside<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> pudding<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.680> deporting

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
is now inside the pudding and deporting

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.749 
is now inside the pudding and deporting
has<00:01:49.640> taken<00:01:49.969> all<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.509> inks<00:01:50.810> away<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:52.490> come

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
has taken all of the inks away you come

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.209 
has taken all of the inks away you come
out<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.119> take<00:01:53.329> your<00:01:53.359> paper<00:01:53.659> if<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.649> is<00:01:54.799> vanilla

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
good luck show show that equation to

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.919 
good luck show show that equation to
Good<00:02:04.909> Will<00:02:05.060> Hunting<00:02:07.570> proof<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
Good Will Hunting proof is in the

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.269 
Good Will Hunting proof is in the
pudding<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:10.160> put<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.399> proof<00:02:10.609> on<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> table
