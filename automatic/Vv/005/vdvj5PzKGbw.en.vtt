 when itâ€™s important to hear footsteps and falling 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.159
 Garnet 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.640
 let's look at the main 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.640
 Characteristics of Cyberia Headphones B2 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.640
 The frequency range of the headphones is 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.909
 from 18 to 28 thousand hertz and cable length 1 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 plus 2 meters microphone directivity 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.000
 unidirectional sensitivity 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.740
 microphone in minus 38 decibels 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.539
 sound card included 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.700

 virtual 7 and 1 equalizer 12 channels 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.150
 Looking at this data, not everyone can 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.340
 understand what criteria for example y 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.200
 headphone frequency range therefore 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.060
 it's time to ask the players themselves 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.650
 why do they choose headphones 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.750
 steelseries siberia v2 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.150
 we asked for an answer to this question 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.610
 to team 121 pie in counter-strike 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.890
 Konstantinu skichko I chose these headphones 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.980
 because first of all they are very 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.909
 practical 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.830
 convenient the only negative is that they 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.989
 if they fall they can break quickly but 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.720
 if you handle them carefully and you can 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:46.890
 say to san by improvement this is one of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.140
 the best steelseries firms and in general 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.319
 this is the right choice of any gene 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.110
 I like the wire so thick too 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.739
 can say practical there is an adapter 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:03.269
 for microphone needs for the line to be 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.400
 headphone extension then basically if 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.829
 a microphone that can turn off a bunch 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.470
 Headphones have different colors 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.400
 want such but such mice when we 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 set up some 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.439
 intel atom some kind of microphone program 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.420
 rises 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.140
 the blocks are probably more correct to say 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.040
 block and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.510
 I can not hear, let's say well, superfluous 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.370
 sounds 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.880
 their players who are next to 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.000
