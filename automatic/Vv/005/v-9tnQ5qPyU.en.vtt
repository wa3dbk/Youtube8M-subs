hi<00:00:03.570> I'm<00:00:03.750> talking<00:00:04.380> bolt<00:00:04.560> racing<00:00:05.130> welcome<00:00:05.700> to

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
hi I'm talking bolt racing welcome to

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.119 
hi I'm talking bolt racing welcome to
pulse<00:00:06.000> TV<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.319> final<00:00:07.710> stage<00:00:07.950> of

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:08.129 
pulse TV and this is the final stage of

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.160 
pulse TV and this is the final stage of
our<00:00:08.309> stage<00:00:08.610> three<00:00:08.969> power-packed<00:00:09.299> where<00:00:10.049> it's

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
our stage three power-packed where it's

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.650 
our stage three power-packed where it's
actually<00:00:10.469> got<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> donor<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.540> on

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
actually got to the donor and this is on

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.339 
actually got to the donor and this is on
my<00:00:12.960> 11<00:00:13.679> basically<00:00:14.490> brand-new<00:00:14.820> model<00:00:15.150> WX<00:00:15.750> for

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 
my 11 basically brand-new model WX for

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:23.870 
my 11 basically brand-new model WX for
every<00:00:16.590> understated<00:00:17.220> car<00:00:19.580> as<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:22.880> whoa

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
every understated car as you see whoa

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.540 
every understated car as you see whoa
whoa<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.630> can't<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.170> now<00:00:25.740> just<00:00:26.010> kidding

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
whoa you can't see this now just kidding

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.310 
whoa you can't see this now just kidding
basically<00:00:27.119> what<00:00:27.660> I'm<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.930> doing<00:00:28.080> here

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
basically what I'm actually doing here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.820 
basically what I'm actually doing here
we're<00:00:28.980> doing<00:00:29.099> our<00:00:30.000> painting<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> pulse<00:00:31.439> edit

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
we're doing our painting the pulse edit

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950 
we're doing our painting the pulse edit
ECU<00:00:32.400> churn<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
ECU churn and what we do there is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
ECU churn and what we do there is
basically<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.250> work<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.299> base

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
basically we actually work with the base

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.719 
basically we actually work with the base
ECU<00:00:37.080> file<00:00:37.320> that's<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.799> the<00:00:37.949> car<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:38.729 
ECU file that's in the car when it

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:40.250 
ECU file that's in the car when it
starts<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.150> obviously<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.720> start<00:00:39.930> off<00:00:40.110> with

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
starts and obviously we start off with

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.740 
starts and obviously we start off with
the<00:00:40.530> file<00:00:40.769> in<00:00:40.949> the<00:00:41.070> car<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.940> suck<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> file<00:00:42.570> out

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the file in the car we suck the file out

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930 
the file in the car we suck the file out
and<00:00:43.049> make<00:00:43.680> changes<00:00:44.159> to<00:00:44.220> suit<00:00:44.580> that<00:00:44.729> one

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and make changes to suit that one

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.460 
and make changes to suit that one
basically<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.659> suit<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:45.960> mods<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.229> are<00:00:46.379> on

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
basically to suit the mods that are on

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.649 
basically to suit the mods that are on
the<00:00:46.589> car<00:00:46.769> and<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.519> we<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> pull<00:00:48.299> down<00:00:48.330> on

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
the car and what we do is pull down on

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.320 
the car and what we do is pull down on
the<00:00:48.750> diner<00:00:48.989> basically<00:00:49.799> big<00:00:50.309> believers<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:50.850> if

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
the diner basically big believers in if

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.149 
the diner basically big believers in if
we're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> tune<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.080> car<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.769> tune<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
we're going to tune the car we tune the

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.910 
we're going to tune the car we tune the
car<00:00:53.369> so<00:00:54.330> what's<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.470> a<00:00:55.589> long<00:00:55.739> process

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
car so what's it it's a long process

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.280 
car so what's it it's a long process
essentially<00:00:56.580> we<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:56.909> it<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.119> the<00:00:57.239> dyno<00:00:57.449> make

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
essentially we put it on the dyno make

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.039 
essentially we put it on the dyno make
changes<00:00:58.830> basically<00:00:59.430> kiss<00:00:59.820> those<00:01:00.059> changes<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
changes basically kiss those changes and

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.950 
changes basically kiss those changes and
then<00:01:01.350> modify<00:01:01.619> them<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.540> put<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.689> in<00:01:03.869> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
then modify them and put it back in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740 
then modify them and put it back in the
car<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.439> change<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.610> forth<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> back

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
car and change it so forth it's a back

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.920 
car and change it so forth it's a back
and<00:01:06.870> forth<00:01:06.990> sort<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.830> generally

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
and forth sort of thing so generally

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
and forth sort of thing so generally
that's<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> only<00:01:10.650> safest<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.580> actually

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that's the only safest way to actually

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960 
that's the only safest way to actually
get<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.930> most<00:01:13.530> air<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.160> heart<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.670> also

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
get the most air out of heart and also

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.300 
get the most air out of heart and also
to<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.420> most<00:01:15.600> reliable

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
to the most reliable

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.460 
to the most reliable
but<00:01:16.909> because<00:01:17.180> we're<00:01:17.299> actually<00:01:17.450> testing<00:01:17.869> the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
but because we're actually testing the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.350 
but because we're actually testing the
car<00:01:18.710> itself<00:01:19.310> when<00:01:19.520> we're<00:01:19.640> tuning<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.060> or

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
car itself when we're tuning it or

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.660 
car itself when we're tuning it or
character<00:01:20.960> because<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:21.680> these<00:01:21.890> cards<00:01:22.190> are

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
character because all these cards are

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.340 
character because all these cards are
fundamentally<00:01:23.240> different<00:01:23.630> in<00:01:23.840> some<00:01:24.049> sort<00:01:24.290> of

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
fundamentally different in some sort of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.469 
fundamentally different in some sort of
way<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.280> tune<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.670> different<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.150> all<00:01:26.270> in

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
way so the tune is different in all in

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.310 
way so the tune is different in all in
every

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
every

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620 
every
minut<00:01:28.310> way<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.180> makes<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.450> big<00:01:29.600> difference

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
minut way but it makes a big difference

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.200 
minut way but it makes a big difference
in<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.409> end<00:01:30.440> result<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.070> also<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.759> safety

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
in the end result and also to the safety

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.180 
in the end result and also to the safety
and<00:01:32.360> reliability<00:01:32.540> of<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.259> path<00:01:33.500> because

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
and reliability of the path because

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.680 
and reliability of the path because
we've<00:01:34.340> actually<00:01:34.490> tested<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.270> extreme

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
we've actually tested it in extreme

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.320 
we've actually tested it in extreme
conditions<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.770> dyno<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.790> know<00:01:37.970> exactly

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
conditions on the dyno we know exactly

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.149 
conditions on the dyno we know exactly
what<00:01:38.659> it's<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.960> do<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.680> how<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.890> make<00:01:39.979> it

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
what it's going to do and how to make it

00:01:40.159 --> 00:03:13.850 
what it's going to do and how to make it
reliable

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.670 

all<00:03:14.860> righty<00:03:15.069> this<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.700> final<00:03:16.090> stage<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.840> us

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
all righty this is the final stage of us

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.369 
all righty this is the final stage of us
Stage<00:03:18.340> three<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.879> it<00:03:19.060> basically<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.230> is

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
Stage three how it basically this is

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.170 
Stage three how it basically this is
where<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.680> all<00:03:20.769> happens<00:03:21.099> on<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.370> donor<00:03:21.579> all

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
where it all happens on the donor all

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.940 
where it all happens on the donor all
the<00:03:22.360> parts<00:03:22.659> have<00:03:22.750> come<00:03:23.049> together<00:03:23.260> and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the parts have come together and

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.009 
the parts have come together and
basically<00:03:24.340> we<00:03:24.670> were<00:03:25.239> given<00:03:25.480> at<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.659> poll<00:03:25.810> said

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
basically we were given at the poll said

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.229 
basically we were given at the poll said
attune<00:03:26.409> so<00:03:27.069> match<00:03:27.250> all<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.610> parts<00:03:27.970> and

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
attune so match all the parts and

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.479 
attune so match all the parts and
basically<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.079> particular<00:03:29.260> vehicle<00:03:29.769> we've

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
basically this particular vehicle we've

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.580 
basically this particular vehicle we've
gone<00:03:30.700> from<00:03:31.090> one<00:03:31.930> hundred<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.230> forty<00:03:32.440> five

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
gone from one hundred and forty five

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.440 
gone from one hundred and forty five
kilowatts<00:03:33.129> all<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.909> way<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.269> two<00:03:34.420> hundred

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
kilowatts all the way up to two hundred

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.440 
kilowatts all the way up to two hundred
and<00:03:34.840> ten<00:03:35.079> kilowatts<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.980> that's<00:03:36.459> to<00:03:37.090> keeping

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
and ten kilowatts and that's to keeping

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.449 
and ten kilowatts and that's to keeping
a<00:03:37.540> reliable<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.829> this<00:03:39.040> one<00:03:39.220> we're<00:03:39.370> actually

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
a reliable and this one we're actually

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.039 
a reliable and this one we're actually
about<00:03:39.730> sixteen<00:03:40.120> point<00:03:40.359> five<00:03:40.510> pounds<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.959> boost

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
about sixteen point five pounds of boost

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.300 
about sixteen point five pounds of boost
it<00:03:41.709> was<00:03:41.799> very<00:03:42.010> very<00:03:42.190> reliable<00:03:44.010> basically<00:03:45.010> just

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
it was very very reliable basically just

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.830 
it was very very reliable basically just
about<00:03:45.549> doubled<00:03:46.510> torque<00:03:46.840> on<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.200> car<00:03:51.720> makes<00:03:52.720> it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
about doubled torque on the car makes it

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.649 
about doubled torque on the car makes it
so<00:03:53.319> much<00:03:53.500> more<00:03:53.680> fun<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:54.040> drive<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.700> by<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.540> way

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
so much more fun to drive and by the way

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.070 
so much more fun to drive and by the way
that's<00:03:55.780> cool<00:03:56.049> power

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.530 

we<00:03:59.680> spend<00:03:59.950> probably<00:04:00.100> 50%<00:04:00.730> of<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.090> time<00:04:01.300> in

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
we spend probably 50% of the time in

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.570 
we spend probably 50% of the time in
here<00:04:01.780> basically<00:04:02.410> doing<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.220> drainage

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
here basically doing the drainage

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.880 
here basically doing the drainage
straddle<00:04:04.030> drivability<00:04:05.020> stuff<00:04:05.290> because

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
straddle drivability stuff because

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.530 
straddle drivability stuff because
realistically<00:04:06.220> that's<00:04:07.000> where<00:04:07.240> you're<00:04:07.390> going

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
realistically that's where you're going

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.820 
realistically that's where you're going
to<00:04:07.630> use<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:07.990> you're<00:04:08.320> gonna<00:04:08.440> feel<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
to use it you're gonna feel the

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.560 
to use it you're gonna feel the
difference<00:04:09.250> driving<00:04:09.730> out<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> driveway

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
difference driving out the driveway

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.480 
difference driving out the driveway
the<00:04:11.230> difference<00:04:11.530> is<00:04:11.650> night<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.100> day<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
the difference is night and day and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.670 
the difference is night and day and
partial<00:04:12.970> floral<00:04:13.240> stuff<00:04:13.480> because<00:04:14.140> we<00:04:14.260> spend<00:04:14.530> so

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
partial floral stuff because we spend so

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.720 
partial floral stuff because we spend so
much<00:04:14.800> time<00:04:14.860> there

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
much time there

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.970 
much time there
everything<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.690> make<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:18.020> car<00:04:18.320> really

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
everything to make this car really

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.310 
everything to make this car really
really<00:04:19.190> fun<00:04:19.550> to<00:04:19.730> drive<00:04:19.940> even<00:04:20.660> if<00:04:20.960> you're<00:04:21.140> not

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
really fun to drive even if you're not

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.610 
really fun to drive even if you're not
bringing<00:04:22.130> it's<00:04:22.400> now
