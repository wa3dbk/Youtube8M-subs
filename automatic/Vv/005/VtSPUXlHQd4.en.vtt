00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.010
 so hello it's nico train for his 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.660
 second video and we will try to 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.980
 to make it work I said well here 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.400
 because I do not know if she 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.679
 run this marc locomotive 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:21.220
 joseph steam locomotive which is very 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:24.849
 very damaged the minutes show a body 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.609
 they are so we will try to do it 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.990
 to work excuse me I'm a role 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:35.079
 but it's gone so yes so I 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.520
 moved the thing so it's not easy 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.620
 because of the netting too short 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.120
 so I am obliged to the same is here we 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.780
 will try to operate it 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.780
 does not work 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.910
 pretty similar it works rather 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.350
 not bad so we'll go do some 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.750
 turns to 7 works well 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.710
 oh yeah here it is given it's because 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.119
 they hate to a problem 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.580
 wow softly yeah so here I did 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.100
 a big mistake that she went into 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 all the things 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.979
 so here I am going to stop the video 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 now because I have to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.600
 look at this case as a problem 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 can you shut up with wa so 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:32.940
 it's a brand playing its 231 its 60 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.940
 so that's a pretty good notion 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.570
 will miss her a bit said she a little 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:49.780
 limit everywhere she's being rolled are from 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 through the year they are through and 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.060
 tied to its tensioner which I want to 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.979
 specify that against this one I do not 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.900
 did not buy 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.430
 in fact I discovered I discovered 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.110
 I want to put myself in this 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.939
 passion because I like trains 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.980

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.209

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.180
 that one does not work but I believe 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.850
 that this one works I records 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 and a moment has worked it's 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.930
 everywhere we will try it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.400
 we're going to not work very well 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.120
 but otherwise it works a little close 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.870

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.090
