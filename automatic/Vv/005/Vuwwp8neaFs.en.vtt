00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
seen too many things publicized about

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.510 
seen too many things publicized about
what's<00:00:18.449> being<00:00:18.859> created<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.010> either<00:00:20.189> platform

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
what's being created for either platform

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.660 
what's being created for either platform
we<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.660> there<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.350> 15<00:00:22.980> exclusives

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
we do know that there are 15 exclusives

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.870 
we do know that there are 15 exclusives
and<00:00:23.820> eight<00:00:24.000> new<00:00:24.180> IPS<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:25.880> Microsoft's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
and eight new IPS for Microsoft's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.339 
and eight new IPS for Microsoft's
platform<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.480> don't<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> number

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
platform we don't really have a number

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.980 
platform we don't really have a number
for<00:00:28.680> Sony<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.300> seems<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.810> number

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
for Sony and it seems like that number

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.380 
for Sony and it seems like that number
is<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.679> increase<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.149> are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
is going to increase because they are

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.530 
is going to increase because they are
getting<00:00:33.780> games<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.890> warframe<00:00:35.489> ready<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.360> go

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
getting games like warframe ready to go

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630

system and something happened and now

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
system and something happened and now
they<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.140> protected<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.670> entity<00:01:12.090> called

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
basically brought to near extinction

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
basically brought to near extinction
levels<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:23.420> basically<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:25.259> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
hunters which are the three races

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
hunters which are the three races
they've<00:01:29.880> confirmed<00:01:30.540> talked<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.320> far<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
they've confirmed talked about so far I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.050 
they've confirmed talked about so far I
don't<00:01:31.799> know<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.070> there's<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
don't know if there's more or not and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.569 
don't know if there's more or not and
you're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> figure<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.680> what<00:01:35.130> happened

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you're going to figure out what happened

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.899 
you're going to figure out what happened
pretty<00:01:36.180> much<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.159> detailed<00:01:38.700> some

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
pretty much they also have detailed some

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
pretty much they also have detailed some
of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> enemies<00:01:40.200> which<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> fallen<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of the enemies which are the fallen and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.630 
of the enemies which are the fallen and
the<00:01:42.030> Cabal<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.680> setting<00:01:43.950> which<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.460> on

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the Cabal and the setting which is on

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.179 
the Cabal and the setting which is on
the<00:01:46.100> basically<00:01:47.100> destroyed<00:01:47.640> earth<00:01:48.200> moon<00:01:49.200> Mars

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the basically destroyed earth moon Mars

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.450 
the basically destroyed earth moon Mars
and<00:01:50.610> Venus<00:01:51.259> so<00:01:52.259> again<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> isn't<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> solar

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and Venus so again this isn't the solar

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.810 
and Venus so again this isn't the solar
system<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> expect<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:55.460> many<00:01:56.460> more

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
system I expect there to be many more

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.550 
system I expect there to be many more
areas<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.509> open<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.840> around<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> solar

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
areas that open up around the solar

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
areas that open up around the solar
system<00:01:59.100> but<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> huge

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
system but this is going to be a huge

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
system but this is going to be a huge
game<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> feel<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.340> Bungie<00:02:05.670> so

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I'm expecting a lot of quality to have a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
I'm expecting a lot of quality to have a
lot<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.829> expectations<00:02:08.700> very<00:02:09.030> very<00:02:09.330> high

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
