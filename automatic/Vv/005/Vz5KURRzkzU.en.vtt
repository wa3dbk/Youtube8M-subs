 match trains even though the president 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.360

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.450
 minute newspaper 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.039
 that's what I wanted to ask you this 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.530
 as compared to what they believed 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.899
 not only with regard to studies 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.360
 I have months for the minute newspaper 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 that's what happens is that I have 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.359
 the impression that unfortunately there is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.610
 small problems with regard to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:12.689
 the wet water is watching I think yes for 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 here on Sunday the dada couple separates the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.369
 this couple is beautiful but we say everything from 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.750
 even there are eels under rock 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.960
 between the princess 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 go you place it room is a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 excellent horsewoman 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.670
 this is not a reason to assert 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.670
 that anne is adam 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.320
 what you do not believe it would be good 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.060
 let's say it would be pretty good 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.380
 for you if you had on the stadiums 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 high competition because it takes 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.569
 to say that at home you are pretty bad at 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 what do not worry we have 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.950
 always beat the whites in snow 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.720
 well there is no more question then 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.540
 I would finish it was conference of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.180
 Press pulling my maxim 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.380
 little white booklet that says aoun has known 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.410
 a moment that another big scam 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.860
 rona otherwise more annoying the less 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.750
 quickly, the less I advance, the stronger 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 way ghana remains to that of horse
