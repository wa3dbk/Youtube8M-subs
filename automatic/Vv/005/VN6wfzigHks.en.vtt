point two five square inches vide that
by<00:00:51.199> 144<00:00:51.860> square<00:00:52.190> inches<00:00:52.699> which<00:00:53.570> is<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.320> know

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
by 144 square inches which is a you know

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.369 
by 144 square inches which is a you know
144<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:55.729> uh<00:00:57.010> 144<00:00:58.010> square<00:00:58.129> inches<00:00:58.579> in<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.760> foot

144 is uh 144 square inches in a foot

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.570 
144 is uh 144 square inches in a foot
you<00:01:00.379> get<00:01:00.530> three<00:01:00.829> point<00:01:01.129> two<00:01:01.370> six<00:01:01.640> square<00:01:02.600> feet

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
you get three point two six square feet

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.730 
you get three point two six square feet
so<00:01:04.580> here<00:01:04.790> we're<00:01:04.909> going<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.059> show<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.740> that

so here we're going to show you that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.870 
so here we're going to show you that
this<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.130> should<00:01:07.369> easily<00:01:07.580> be<00:01:07.789> there

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.930 

try<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:15.940> apply<00:01:16.300> it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:40.910 

very<00:01:25.940> thin

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 

if<00:01:41.370> this<00:01:41.580> if<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> gets<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.540> dirty<00:01:42.750> down

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
if this if this gets really dirty down

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
if this if this gets really dirty down
here<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.150> would<00:01:45.150> suggest<00:01:45.300> wiping<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.020> off

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
here I would suggest wiping this off

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.480 
here I would suggest wiping this off
just

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
just

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.700 
just
makes<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.180> flow<00:01:50.390> better

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:19.680 

don't<00:02:00.070> worry<00:02:00.250> about<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.640> excess

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:28.320 

this<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.870> roughly<00:02:21.200> three<00:02:21.530> passes<00:02:22.960> C<00:02:24.520> equals

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.790 

hopefully<00:02:29.330> right<00:02:29.510> around<00:02:29.750> by<00:02:30.790> five<00:02:31.790> inches

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
hopefully right around by five inches

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.080 
hopefully right around by five inches
this<00:02:33.800> is<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:36.220> roughly<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> foot

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.180 

right

right
go<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.569> can<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.870> foam<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.920> expect

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
go out of a can of foam you can expect

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.540 
go out of a can of foam you can expect
to<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:46.640> somewhere<00:02:47.000> near<00:02:47.209> that<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:48.400> want<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.459> go

just leave this sit per say I don't know

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.230 
just leave this sit per say I don't know
three<00:03:45.730> four<00:03:45.940> days<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.100> pull<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.090> right

three four days you can pull it right
out

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
out

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.870 
out
nozzle<00:03:51.280> -<00:03:51.490> good<00:03:52.090> as<00:03:52.210> new<00:03:53.490> your<00:03:54.490> little<00:03:54.730> less

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
nozzle - good as new your little less

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.840 
nozzle - good as new your little less
impatient<00:03:55.450> than<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.700> suggest<00:03:57.700> using

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
impatient than that I suggest using

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.650 
impatient than that I suggest using
break<00:03:58.240> clean<00:03:58.830> when<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.890> grow<00:04:00.100> up

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
break clean when you grow up

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:09.120 
break clean when you grow up
just<00:04:01.660> basically<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.350> solve<00:04:02.560> for<00:04:02.800> foam<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:09.040> you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
just basically to solve for foam and you

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.120 
just basically to solve for foam and you
can<00:04:09.250> clean<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.550> out<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.890> if<00:04:11.890> you're

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
can clean it out with that if you're

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.180 
can clean it out with that if you're
impatient<00:04:15.030> back<00:04:16.470> still<00:04:17.470> got<00:04:17.620> plenty<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:17.950> foam

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
impatient back still got plenty of foam

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.070 
impatient back still got plenty of foam
left<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:22.120> know<00:04:22.180> go<00:04:22.330> back<00:04:22.510> in

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
left you know go back in

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.830 
left you know go back in
fix<00:04:23.560> these<00:04:23.770> spots<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:25.210> need<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.420> do<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> now<00:04:25.810> or

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
fix these spots you need to do it now or

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:46.590 
fix these spots you need to do it now or
you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.350> wait<00:04:26.410> until<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.130> cures

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:05:12.639 

we<00:04:47.020> have<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.230> be<00:04:47.320> very<00:04:47.560> careful

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:12.649 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:15.790 

I'll<00:05:13.649> just<00:05:13.769> go<00:05:13.949> ahead<00:05:14.069> this<00:05:14.789> is<00:05:14.939> my<00:05:15.119> test<00:05:15.389> piece

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
I'll just go ahead this is my test piece

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.899 
I'll just go ahead this is my test piece
I'll<00:05:16.800> go<00:05:16.919> ahead<00:05:16.979> and<00:05:17.159> show<00:05:17.309> you<00:05:17.369> what<00:05:17.519> happens

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
I'll go ahead and show you what happens

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.379 
I'll go ahead and show you what happens
if<00:05:18.209> you<00:05:18.330> try<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:20.899> try<00:05:21.899> to<00:05:21.929> flatten<00:05:22.259> foam<00:05:22.649> out

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
if you try to try to flatten foam out

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.260 
if you try to try to flatten foam out
afterwards

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.080 

just<00:05:27.389> rips<00:05:27.870> apart<00:05:28.310> because<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.490> turn<00:05:29.729> on<00:05:29.970> the

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
just rips apart because you turn on the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:38.869 
just rips apart because you turn on the
phone

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.200 

course<00:05:39.389> you<00:05:39.509> can<00:05:39.689> do<00:05:39.779> like<00:05:40.050> this

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
course you can do like this

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.470 
course you can do like this
it's<00:05:43.210> time-consuming

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.140 

come<00:05:47.960> back<00:05:48.140> for<00:05:48.380> a<00:05:48.410> later<00:05:48.620> shot<00:05:48.890> on<00:05:49.100> that<00:05:49.250> show

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
come back for a later shot on that show

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.780 
come back for a later shot on that show
you<00:05:50.210> how<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.510> cured
