they're so you'll want to climb it a
little<00:01:29.030> more<00:01:29.210> insight<00:01:29.600> which<00:01:30.500> could<00:01:30.740> make<00:01:30.890> it

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
little more insight which could make it

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.510 
little more insight which could make it
harder<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.180> when<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.420> found<00:01:33.160> years<00:01:34.160> ago<00:01:34.400> on

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
harder and when I found years ago on

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.210 
harder and when I found years ago on
this<00:01:34.640> one<00:01:34.850> climb<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:36.260> was<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.440> tight<00:01:36.710> squeeze<00:01:36.740> to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
this one climb it was a tight squeeze to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.270 
this one climb it was a tight squeeze to
me<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.210> couldn't<00:01:38.420> get<00:01:38.540> Hill<00:01:38.720> toes<00:01:38.960> anymore

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
me and I couldn't get Hill toes anymore

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.490 
me and I couldn't get Hill toes anymore
and<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.370> was<00:01:40.520> gone<00:01:40.810> straight<00:01:41.810> up<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.140> down<00:01:42.170> at

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
and I was gone straight up and down at

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700 
and I was gone straight up and down at
it<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:43.729> couldn't<00:01:43.940> move<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.510> mean<00:01:44.720> was

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
it and I just couldn't move I mean was

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.260 
it and I just couldn't move I mean was
taking<00:01:46.040> so<00:01:46.190> much<00:01:46.340> energy<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:46.850> just<00:01:47.030> move<00:01:47.150> a

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
taking so much energy to just move a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.540 
taking so much energy to just move a
couple<00:01:47.450> inches<00:01:47.750> so<00:01:48.710> bin<00:01:48.890> see<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.100> figured<00:01:49.430> out

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
couple inches so bin see I figured out

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.150 
couple inches so bin see I figured out
that<00:01:49.700> in<00:01:49.820> just<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.510> size<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.710> i<00:01:51.800> turn<00:01:51.860> my

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
that in just in that size if i turn my

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.550 
that in just in that size if i turn my
body<00:01:52.340> kind<00:01:52.580> of<00:01:52.700> sideways<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.300> this<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:54.500> I

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
body kind of sideways like this and I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.170 
body kind of sideways like this and I
actually<00:01:54.710> can<00:01:55.040> move<00:01:55.190> really<00:01:55.400> fast<00:01:55.550> they<00:01:56.000> call

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
actually can move really fast they call

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.480 
actually can move really fast they call
it<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.390> Sidewinder<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.860> let's<00:01:58.040> see<00:01:58.160> let<00:01:58.310> me<00:01:58.340> go

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
it the Sidewinder so let's see let me go

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.499 
it the Sidewinder so let's see let me go
down<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> little<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.030> then<00:01:59.149> i'll<00:01:59.240> send<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.479> the

down a little and then i'll send you the

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.600 
down a little and then i'll send you the
whole<00:01:59.720> progression<00:02:00.160> it's<00:02:01.160> actually<00:02:01.460> pretty

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
whole progression it's actually pretty

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.180 
whole progression it's actually pretty
cool<00:02:01.910> because<00:02:02.899> you're<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.410> sizes<00:02:03.860> you

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.870 
you can move faster chicken wing reverse
chicken<00:02:09.530> wing<00:02:09.679> although<00:02:09.920> cracks<00:02:10.310> too<00:02:10.520> big<00:02:10.700> for

be not tiny if I started down lower let
me<00:02:37.100> go<00:02:37.220> ahead<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.370> see<00:02:37.600> if<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.660> works<00:02:38.989> but

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
me go ahead and see if that works but

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.640 
me go ahead and see if that works but
the<00:02:40.010> Sidewinders<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:41.049> super<00:02:42.049> cool<00:02:42.200> technique

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
the Sidewinders a super cool technique

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.740 
the Sidewinders a super cool technique
because<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.790> liquid<00:02:44.090> oil<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.390> can<00:02:44.540> do<00:02:44.630> in

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
because the liquid oil you can do in

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.810 
because the liquid oil you can do in
wide<00:02:44.930> cracks<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.440> like<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:45.830> pushing<00:02:46.700> out

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
wide cracks to like just pushing out

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.729 
wide cracks to like just pushing out
with<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.090> legs<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.570> holding<00:02:47.840> myself<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
with my legs and holding myself in and

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.890 
with my legs and holding myself in and
if<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.040> go<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.370> more<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.940> don't<00:02:50.630> have<00:02:50.780> to

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
if I go a little more I don't have to

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.270 
if I go a little more I don't have to
push<00:02:51.080> out<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.440> legs<00:02:51.650> i'm<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:51.950> sitting

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
push out with my legs i'm just sitting

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.270 
push out with my legs i'm just sitting
in<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.459> crack<00:02:53.799> layin<00:02:54.799> right<00:02:54.890> now<00:02:55.070> i'm<00:02:55.160> just

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
in the crack layin right now i'm just

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.580 
in the crack layin right now i'm just
hanging<00:02:55.580> off<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:55.820> shoulders<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:57.380> those<00:02:57.560> are

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
hanging off my shoulders so those are

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.460 
hanging off my shoulders so those are
ways<00:02:57.799> you<00:02:57.830> can<00:02:58.100> rest<00:02:58.989> going<00:02:59.989> down<00:03:00.290> these

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
ways you can rest going down these

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.620 
ways you can rest going down these
things<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.799> easy<00:03:00.830> because<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.450> ease<00:03:02.600> up

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
things is easy because you just ease up

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.259 
things is easy because you just ease up
the<00:03:02.870> pressure<00:03:03.489> we<00:03:04.489> should<00:03:04.640> start<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.880> new<00:03:04.940> sport

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
the pressure we should start a new sport

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.800 
the pressure we should start a new sport
off<00:03:05.480> with<00:03:05.690> down<00:03:05.959> costs<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.380> effort

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.730 

down<00:03:10.860> down<00:03:11.860> with<00:03:11.920> him<00:03:12.310> yeah<00:03:12.550> oh<00:03:12.990> well<00:03:13.990> now<00:03:14.440> look

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
down down with him yeah oh well now look

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.200 
down down with him yeah oh well now look
outside<00:03:14.980> right<00:03:15.250> either<00:03:15.490> reverse<00:03:15.820> inverse

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
outside right either reverse inverse

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:27.210 
outside right either reverse inverse
better<00:03:17.020> be<00:03:17.260> haha<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:24.100> far<00:03:24.370> so<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:26.220> eventually

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
better be haha so far so it's eventually

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.160 
better be haha so far so it's eventually
like<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.770> real<00:03:30.070> people<00:03:30.120> no<00:03:31.120> actors<00:03:31.960> or

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
like these are real people no actors or

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.610 
like these are real people no actors or
animals<00:03:32.710> have<00:03:32.980> been<00:03:33.100> harmed<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:34.210> is<00:03:34.450> um<00:03:34.630> you

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
but it's actually easier than going

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.560 
but it's actually easier than going
straight<00:03:41.860> up<00:03:42.130> like<00:03:42.550> straight<00:03:42.580> on<00:03:42.970> look<00:03:43.240> I<00:03:43.360> just

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
here and without using a whole lot of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.500 
here and without using a whole lot of
strength<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.220> rest<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.270> spot<00:03:49.480> like

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
strength that can rest in a spot like

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.830 
strength that can rest in a spot like
this<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.800> little<00:03:51.360> torsion<00:03:52.360> on<00:03:52.480> my<00:03:52.600> hips
