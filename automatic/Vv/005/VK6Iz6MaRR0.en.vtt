today<00:00:00.690> we<00:00:00.960> will<00:00:01.140> be<00:00:01.319> making<00:00:01.500> Perugian<00:00:02.399> blue

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
today we will be making Perugian blue

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.249 
today we will be making Perugian blue
for<00:00:03.659> this<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:03.990> need<00:00:04.140> some<00:00:05.420> potassium<00:00:06.420> hacks<00:00:07.049> a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
for this you need some potassium hacks a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.799 
for this you need some potassium hacks a
cyano<00:00:07.919> ferret<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.510> solution<00:00:11.480> called<00:00:12.480> yellow

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
cyano ferret in a solution called yellow

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.849 
cyano ferret in a solution called yellow
poogie<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:14.509> some<00:00:15.509> ammonium<00:00:16.199> iron<00:00:16.470> sulfate

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
poogie and some ammonium iron sulfate

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.240 
poogie and some ammonium iron sulfate
which<00:00:19.859> also<00:00:20.100> will<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.640> come<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.180> solution

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.220 

first<00:00:26.250> prepare<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> solution<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.660> ammonium

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
first prepare a solution of ammonium

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.940 
first prepare a solution of ammonium
iron<00:00:28.439> sulfate<00:00:36.260> all<00:00:37.260> right<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.770> getting

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
iron sulfate all right now I'm getting

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.639 
iron sulfate all right now I'm getting
the<00:00:38.190> supplies<00:00:39.890> for<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.040> chemistry<00:00:41.610> kit<00:00:45.649> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the supplies for my chemistry kit so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.920 
the supplies for my chemistry kit so
there's<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.360> test<00:00:48.360> tube<00:00:48.510> filled<00:00:48.870> with

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
there's my test tube filled with

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.260 
there's my test tube filled with
distilled<00:00:49.559> water<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:52.910> I'm<00:00:53.910> gonna<00:00:54.059> add<00:00:54.239> some

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
distilled water and I'm gonna add some

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.579 
distilled water and I'm gonna add some
crystals<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> ammonium<00:00:55.620> iron<00:00:55.739> sulfate<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.520> it

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.350 

so<00:01:04.589> there's<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.129> ammonium<00:01:05.489> iron<00:01:05.610> sulfate<00:01:06.180> I'm

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so there's my ammonium iron sulfate I'm

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
so there's my ammonium iron sulfate I'm
opening<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:09.110> okay<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.130> they're

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
opening it up okay you can see they're

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.359 
opening it up okay you can see they're
big<00:01:11.490> crystals<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.950> they're<00:01:13.950> purple

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
big crystals in there they're purple

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
big crystals in there they're purple
colored<00:01:14.820> but<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.630> mixed<00:01:15.780> with

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
colored but when they are mixed with

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
colored but when they are mixed with
water<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.530> create<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> yellow<00:01:17.280> Brown

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
water they create a yellow Brown

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
water they create a yellow Brown
solution<00:01:26.119> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> yellow<00:01:27.930> Brown

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
solution as you can see the yellow Brown

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.630 
solution as you can see the yellow Brown
solution<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:29.009> form<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.150> stir<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> in

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:51.690 

yellowish<00:01:35.640> color

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.780 

so<00:01:52.700> now<00:01:52.910> I'm<00:01:53.440> gonna<00:01:54.440> add<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> few<00:01:55.280> drops<00:01:55.460> of

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
so now I'm gonna add a few drops of

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.110 
so now I'm gonna add a few drops of
potassium<00:01:56.600> access<00:01:56.930> I<00:01:57.110> enough<00:01:57.410> aerate<00:01:58.120> and

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
potassium access I enough aerate and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.300 
potassium access I enough aerate and
you'll<00:01:59.300> see<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.750> wonderful<00:02:00.410> blue<00:02:00.770> color<00:02:01.040> that

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
you'll see the wonderful blue color that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.480 
you'll see the wonderful blue color that
comes<00:02:01.490> out<00:02:05.620> so<00:02:06.620> I'm<00:02:06.800> adding<00:02:06.920> my<00:02:07.130> supplies

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
comes out so I'm adding my supplies

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.609 
comes out so I'm adding my supplies
ready<00:02:07.700> right<00:02:08.000> now

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
ready right now

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.920 
ready right now
and<00:02:09.619> there's<00:02:10.280> my<00:02:10.460> potassium<00:02:10.910> excess<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.570> narrow

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
and there's my potassium excess I narrow

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.010 
and there's my potassium excess I narrow
fair<00:02:12.440> eight<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.980> my<00:02:13.190> solution<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.840> I'm<00:02:14.900> gonna

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
fair eight in my solution and I'm gonna

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.460 
fair eight in my solution and I'm gonna
open<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.470> up<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.900> notice<00:02:17.900> for<00:02:18.080> any<00:02:18.200> color

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
open it up and notice for any color

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
open it up and notice for any color
changes

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.530 

as<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.280> see<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.550> makes<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.819> beautiful<00:02:33.360> blue

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
as you can see it makes a beautiful blue

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.400 
as you can see it makes a beautiful blue
color<00:02:33.980> I'm<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.160> sure<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.700> reaction<00:02:36.180> is

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
color I'm not sure what the reaction is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.870 
color I'm not sure what the reaction is
if<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.770> could<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.160> please<00:02:38.370> comment<00:02:38.670> and
