00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
set it to a metallic sea green which is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
set it to a metallic sea green which is
already<00:01:41.880> great<00:01:42.210> color<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.750> its<00:01:42.899> own<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
already great color in its own but it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.289 
already great color in its own but it
definitely<00:01:43.680> does<00:01:43.799> look<00:01:43.829> nothing<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
definitely does look nothing like a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.240 
definitely does look nothing like a
dragon<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> pretty

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
dragon now then you want a pretty

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330 
dragon now then you want a pretty
pearlescent<00:01:47.820> over<00:01:48.060> top<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.829> yellow

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pearlescent over top of that as a yellow

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
pearlescent over top of that as a yellow
or<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> race<00:01:50.970> yellow<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.810> race<00:01:52.020> yellow

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
or a race yellow I use race yellow

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.450 
or a race yellow I use race yellow
because<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> looks<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.070> lot<00:01:53.220> better

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because I think it looks a lot better

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
because I think it looks a lot better
but<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.840> low<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.290> what

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but you can use that low if that's what

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
but you can use that low if that's what
you<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.770> looks<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.490> dragon<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you think looks more of a dragon and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
you think looks more of a dragon and
then<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.200> using<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
then if you're going to be using the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.280 
then if you're going to be using the
secondary<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.340> highly<00:02:00.030> recommend<00:02:00.450> using<00:02:00.659> red

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
secondary I highly recommend using red

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.740 
secondary I highly recommend using red
as<00:02:01.500> well<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> real<00:02:03.090> color<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
as well as with the real color so the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.149 
as well as with the real color so the
vehicle<00:02:04.140> music<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.710> doesn't<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
vehicle music here doesn't have a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
vehicle music here doesn't have a
secondary<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.090> instead<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
secondary so instead I just put the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
secondary so instead I just put the
wheels<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.740> red<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.819> well<00:02:09.000> as<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> neon

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
wheels as a red as well as the neon

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.930 
wheels as a red as well as the neon
lights

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
definitely definitely recommend using

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.680 
definitely definitely recommend using
midnight<00:02:57.400> blue<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:57.940> definitely<00:02:58.090> blends<00:02:58.510> in

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
midnight blue so it definitely blends in

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.720 
midnight blue so it definitely blends in
well<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.290> they<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.560> neon<00:02:59.860> kits<00:03:00.250> below<00:03:00.580> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
well if they have neon kits below it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.950 
well if they have neon kits below it
such<00:03:00.910> as<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:01.510> you're<00:03:01.630> playing<00:03:01.810> on

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
such as I do if you're playing on

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.990 
such as I do if you're playing on
next-gen<00:03:02.470> I'd<00:03:02.890> recommend<00:03:03.490> putting<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
next-gen I'd recommend putting that like

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.760 
next-gen I'd recommend putting that like
a<00:03:04.090> hot<00:03:04.300> pink<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.170> would<00:03:05.260> definitely<00:03:05.410> give

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
a hot pink and it would definitely give

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.400 
a hot pink and it would definitely give
it<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.790> guess<00:03:07.060> galaxies<00:03:07.630> feel<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.900> suppose

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
it the I guess galaxies feel I suppose

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.050 
it the I guess galaxies feel I suppose
now<00:03:08.890> fortunately<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.550> does<00:03:09.700> not<00:03:09.820> look<00:03:10.000> that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
now fortunately it does not look that

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.790 
now fortunately it does not look that
great<00:03:10.330> during<00:03:10.720> night<00:03:10.900> time<00:03:10.930> unlike<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> other

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
great during night time unlike the other

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.949 
great during night time unlike the other
two<00:03:11.980> colors<00:03:12.160> I've<00:03:12.430> shown<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.790> guys<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.210> again

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
two colors I've shown you guys and again

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.900 
two colors I've shown you guys and again
unfortunately<00:03:14.110> since<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:15.130> recording<00:03:15.580> I

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
unfortunately since I was recording I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.610 
unfortunately since I was recording I
didn't<00:03:16.180> want<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.360> pull<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.660> outside<00:03:16.780> because<00:03:17.560> I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
didn't want to pull it outside because I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.110 
didn't want to pull it outside because I
want<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.830> show<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.040> guys<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.610> paint<00:03:18.820> job<00:03:19.000> in

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
want to show you guys this paint job in

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.180 
want to show you guys this paint job in
its<00:03:19.240> full<00:03:19.420> effect<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.410> course<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:20.950> in

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
its full effect and of course that is in

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.070 
its full effect and of course that is in
the<00:03:21.400> light<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.240> how<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.570> looks<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.900> looks

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
the light so this how it looks it looks

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.480 
the light so this how it looks it looks
really<00:03:23.350> really<00:03:23.380> cool<00:03:23.590> especially<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.430> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
really really cool especially when the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.860 
really really cool especially when the
sun's<00:03:24.730> beating<00:03:24.910> off<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.420> but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
sun's beating off of it but

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.600 
sun's beating off of it but
unfortunately<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.560> guess<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:26.980> was<00:03:27.070> bad<00:03:27.250> timing

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
unfortunately I guess it was bad timing

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.430 
unfortunately I guess it was bad timing
so<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.600> really<00:03:28.870> really<00:03:28.959> cool<00:03:29.110> paint

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
so this is a really really cool paint

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.170 
so this is a really really cool paint
job<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.890> looks<00:03:30.010> great<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.459> just<00:03:30.790> about<00:03:30.910> any

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180
