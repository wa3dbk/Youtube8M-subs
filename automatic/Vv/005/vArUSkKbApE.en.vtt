00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.590
 we are interested in France 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.779
 we do not see very clearly who 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.780
 and that's what is ranked 55th 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.780
 global 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.780
 if not the other players on this team 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.039
 we do not see very often and at tine 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 he still did very well 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.120
 especially last year during the pro 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.260
 turn he reached the final 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.210
 the impro turning in the season which 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.989
 to see several difficult to lead 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.989
 the train at the arena the blow 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.620
 then the patrick with a lot of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.620
 rotations 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.700
 for France in this first set 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.500
 yes there patrick is doing a serious match he 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.500
 let nothing pass 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.130
 good then this lacan that varies more than 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.220
 the defender which is still pretty 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.270
 unusual since the favorite weapon of the 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.790
 the censors is still the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.970
 ball variation finally he plays first 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.970
 set 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.880
 perfect 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.880
 21 9 for France 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.610
 jean philippe gatien who apparently is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.770
 in top form since the beginning of these 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.100
 world championships in a good 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100
 galley 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.940
 also concentrated for now and for 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.220
 it goes on like that very single ball 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.980
 still the beginning of the match and I believe that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.270
 a defender must at times also 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.300
 gone into attack if a production 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.320
 behind so I think every mine 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
 should try to attack a little bit 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.890
 more if the young is patrick what is it 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.470
 that until you are really very very 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.880
 well released the few players are 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.880
 able to shoot cameroon like that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 I 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.960
 patrick the markets a difficult point 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960
 to assure them a little bit 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.690
 there he pulls the points well too fast 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.950
 there is some security to the score there 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.950
 must continue to do so 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.580
 and most importantly reliably his series of 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.320
 services and again because it was from 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.670
 finish the point a bit too fast it's 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.750
 true that it's tempting because the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.750
 ball seems and fascinating 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550
 I 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.409
 what she is claiming 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.070
 beautiful very beautiful start of 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.660
 the France team in this eighth of 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.650
 final against Belarus with this 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.650
 victory of patrick chila
