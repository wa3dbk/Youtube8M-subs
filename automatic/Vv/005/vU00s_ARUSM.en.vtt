00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.150
 man's birth and roll 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.000
 this number to a prime number from one to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.600
 nine for example a check was born 1 9 you 970 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 years 1 plus 9 plus 1 plus 9 plus 7 will be 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 27 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 2 + 7 is 9 so we have the number 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 life on the way 9 nine is very strong 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:54.570
 and the number is considered the number of philanthropists 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.059
 the number of service to humanity and the number 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.930
 possessing colossal energy therefore 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.390
 people number life on the way 9 these are people 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 which lives are constantly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 there is energy at the time they are always 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.479
 strive more they can be 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.100
 militant aggressive because 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.640
 They want to quickly get everything out of life and in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.189
 large quantities on the one hand it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.280
 well on the other hand it requires from 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.590
 surrounding a very large effort in order 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.400
 to find common ground with people number 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 life on the way 9 because 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.970
 ambitiousness and pressure can exceed and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.909
 common sense and besides the number of life 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.040
 on the way 9 so many people pushing on 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.560
 what they do 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 charity is 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.119
 philanthropists 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.740
 they help others for them is very important 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.750
 social sphere can work in such 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.619
 organizations that are engaged 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.619
 charity 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.679
 but the most important thing is that people with number life 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.479
 on a way 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.640
 9 should always do no small things, but 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.920
 something globally and for them it is very 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.970
 important 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.660
 besides the number of life on the way 9 are pushing 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.049
 people on grand projects and for 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.209
 many it is the goal of life you need 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.489
 note that people are life 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 ideas are very sexy 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.680
 This is especially true for women and therefore 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.660
 they are very selective choosing from their 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.780
 partner and if he does not respond 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.129
 certain requirements then for this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:51.000
 women family can turn into 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:54.239
 into that source of negative emotions 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.549
 very important for them romantic 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.810
 component of marriage is important as for 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:04.230
 men so for women and women in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.359
 their personal lives they will always be 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.970
 defend in partnerships 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.579
 family 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 championship because for them is very 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.750
 it is important that the husband is either equal or 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.489
 obeyed and not every man is 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.400
 will arrange if these people are engaged 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.930
 business career do not aspire 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.720
 hold very strong positions and not 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.319
 always the correct way is 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.349
 maybe that path that talks about 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.470
 that man is always right and he is only 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.079
 he himself knows how to get it for 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.440
 people number life on the way 9 it can 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.510
 be a trap by the way they can 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.420
 work in those specialties 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.370
 which suggest such 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.400
 and pressure and aggressiveness is and in 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.360
 armed forces this and firefighters 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.319
 organizations it and where connected 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.500
 by the way with quick decisions and very 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.720
 a lot among people number life on the way 9 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.790
 those who occupy a leading position 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 by the way politicians because they love 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.080
 solve problems globally and usually do not 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.740
 will heed other advice and it happens 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.460
 so don't agree to compromise and 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.060
 for many those who are involved in politics 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.729
 this is 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.690
 is destructive because 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.350
 politics is a compromise and they are their skills 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.800
 comply with this negative trait of people with 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.919
 the number of life on the way 9 h decisions that 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.120
 do not accept may be 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.120
 destructive and yet they will 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.760
 insist on these decisions im very 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.160
 important to pay attention to your health 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.979
 especially they are prone to heart disease 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.800
 and here is this strong nationality and 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.169
 feather bed and perry load it affects 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.970
 on the heart muscle it is important to note that 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.789
 nine is as if collective 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.400
 number that is present in this number 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.720
 component of those other numbers and therefore 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.669
 we see in people the number of life but the way 9 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.380
 wide enough of such a plan 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.150
 personalities that can one side 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.210
 to be leaders from others on the other hand 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.669
 can be comrades and peacemakers 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.970
 they can be a charismatic teacher 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.200
 and vice versa closed that is nine this 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.479
 collective image 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.050
 I want to wish people the number of life on 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.240
 diva's ways to remember that from life you need not 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.970
 only need to take and give for them 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.830
 this is the main task giving away only 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.560
 then they can be realized in life 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.560
 good luck and see you soon
