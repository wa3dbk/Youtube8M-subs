00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
any of you have you started think about

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.410 
any of you have you started think about
a<00:01:28.439> price<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.219> for<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a price point for this at all it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
a price point for this at all it's
probably<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.829> yet<00:01:32.069> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
probably going to be the that has yet to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.410 
probably going to be the that has yet to
be<00:01:32.250> determined<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.819> it's<00:01:33.000> probably<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.329> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
be determined but it's probably going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.569 
be determined but it's probably going to
be<00:01:33.479> standard<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> PSM<00:01:34.649> probably<00:01:35.310> something

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
be standard the PSM probably something

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.270 
be standard the PSM probably something
from<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:35.880> 95<00:01:36.569> or<00:01:36.990> 99
