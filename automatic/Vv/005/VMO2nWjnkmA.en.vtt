00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.970
 hey when I liked that as they are 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.060
 I hope you are very well 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.280
 siemens another new video for the channel 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.110
 from Lebanon this video would be like the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.469
 second part of the tutorial I did 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.839
 not much time that would be to remove the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.659
 sheet the android games with what would be 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:21.580
 this application that was called fix I think 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.480
 yes I do 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.770
 6a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.140
 and well, it can also be used 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.140
 another application because this time is this 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.340
 like this 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.330
 as it is sometimes said, sometimes it does not work 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.190
 it is in order for it for it 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.180
 we need what this other would be 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.040
 application that would be game booster that 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.630
 this that the freckle of this application will be 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.580
 the exclusion of the video to install it 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.670
 we will have to use what would be the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.650
 phone settings go to the apology 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.980
 in the noise of the motorcycle 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.910
 go to the staff section and in 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.080
 the security option after we go to 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.700
 enable the origins option 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.250
 unknown will be disabled 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.430
 probably so the first time 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.740
 as if they are installed 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.170
 an application that does not come from the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.590
 good store what are we going to activate what are we going 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.650
 to say good let's see the phone and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.280
 the personal data are very are more 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.020
 vulnerable to attacks by 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.550
 applications of unknown origin the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.620
 user agrees to be the only responsible 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.780
 of any damage to the phone or 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.430
 loss of data that can be derived 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.230
 of the use of these applications we are going to 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.090
 give in accept 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.490
 and so we want to act what would be 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 verify the application after it 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.980
 well I do not know why we have it activated 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.620
 118 is where some install does not exist 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.450
 we open it is going to ask for root permissions we 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.640
 We attach and here is where preserve 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.060
 lashes I do not know what the fuck they are 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.160
 for a case here in when it seems 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.200
 three option what would be live longer 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.250
 coming I'm sorry they do not pronounce the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470
 ball 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.660
 coming hard gaming ultra gaming good 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.080
 here we will select each 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.090
 well it's more like these options are 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.830
 according to how we want to talk about his games to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.040
 that is not given much obviously goes 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.980

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.530
 matter if for example if you are youtuber 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:33.540
