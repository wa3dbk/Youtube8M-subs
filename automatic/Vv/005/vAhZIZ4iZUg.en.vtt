because I think they were nasty but all
the<00:00:51.940> rest<00:00:52.120> I<00:00:52.329> think<00:00:52.540> are<00:00:52.660> very<00:00:52.690> very<00:00:53.050> good<00:00:53.340> the

and<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:58.180> particular<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:59.140> eyeshadow<00:00:59.710> trios

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
and in particular the eyeshadow trios

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.770 
and in particular the eyeshadow trios
which<00:01:00.489> look<00:01:01.420> like<00:01:01.720> this<00:01:02.020> and<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:04.030> trees<00:01:04.479> are

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
which look like this and these trees are

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.600 
which look like this and these trees are
really<00:01:04.809> inexpensive<00:01:05.350> here<00:01:05.829> in<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.009> UK<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.579> I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
really inexpensive here in the UK and I

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.050 
really inexpensive here in the UK and I
believe<00:01:07.390> in<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.720> states<00:01:07.990> -<00:01:08.290> they<00:01:08.649> contain<00:01:09.060> 1.5

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
believe in the states - they contain 1.5

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.020 
believe in the states - they contain 1.5
grams<00:01:10.869> of<00:01:11.319> product<00:01:11.649> each<00:01:11.889> that<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.639> the<00:01:12.789> same

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
grams of product each that is the same

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.599 
grams of product each that is the same
as<00:01:13.299> a<00:01:13.329> Mac<00:01:13.630> shade<00:01:13.960> they<00:01:14.889> come<00:01:15.069> in<00:01:15.189> these<00:01:15.280> trios

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
as a Mac shade they come in these trios

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.730 
as a Mac shade they come in these trios
they<00:01:15.939> come<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:16.270> fives<00:01:16.600> they<00:01:16.990> come<00:01:17.139> in<00:01:17.259> singles
