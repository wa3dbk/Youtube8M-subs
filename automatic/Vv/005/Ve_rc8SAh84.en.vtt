dislike<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.310> fact<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> transfer

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
dislike for the fact that the transfer

window overlaps at the beginning of the
season<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:23.910> he's<00:00:24.210> completely<00:00:24.630> right

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
season and I think he's completely right

about<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.470> does<00:00:25.650> seem<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.039> be

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
about that it does seem to be

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.839 
about that it does seem to be
nonsensical<00:00:26.730> at<00:00:27.420> times<00:00:28.279> how<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.580> plan<00:00:29.820> for

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
nonsensical at times how do you plan for

nonsensical at times how do you plan for
this<00:00:30.240> kind<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.570> thing<00:00:30.810> particularly<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:31.590> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this kind of thing particularly when you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.010 
this kind of thing particularly when you
have<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> key<00:00:32.070> player<00:00:32.399> whose<00:00:33.090> situation<00:00:33.420> is

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
have a key player whose situation is

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
have a key player whose situation is
vague<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.710> best<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.430> that's<00:00:35.880> been<00:00:36.660> Wiggins

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
vague at best and that's been Wiggins

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.069 
vague at best and that's been Wiggins
problem<00:00:37.350> too<00:00:37.980> often<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> has<00:00:39.300> also<00:00:39.540> been<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
problem too often and has also been the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.770 
problem too often and has also been the
problem<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> summer<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:42.180> Victor<00:00:42.450> Moses

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
situation is extremely unhelpful they

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
situation is extremely unhelpful they
have<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> player<00:00:45.690> who<00:00:45.960> according<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.620> Dave

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
have a player who according to Dave

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
have a player who according to Dave
Whelan<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.910> good<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.180> Leo<00:00:48.360> Messi<00:00:48.660> mind<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Whelan is as good as Leo Messi mind you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.819 
Whelan is as good as Leo Messi mind you
Dave<00:00:49.890> Whelan<00:00:50.039> says<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> things<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
Dave Whelan says a lot of things but

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
Dave Whelan says a lot of things but
it's<00:00:52.829> obvious<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's obvious that when they have one of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
it's obvious that when they have one of
their<00:00:54.809> key<00:00:55.020> players<00:00:55.199> whose<00:00:55.949> future<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.460> very

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
their key players whose future is very

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
their key players whose future is very
much<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> air<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> very

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
much up in the air it makes it very

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.810 
much up in the air it makes it very
difficult<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.829> plan<00:00:58.980> particularly<00:00:59.460> when

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
difficult to plan particularly when

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.119 
difficult to plan particularly when
you're<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> strongest<00:01:01.379> clubs<00:01:01.949> in

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
you're not one of the strongest clubs in

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.470 
you're not one of the strongest clubs in
the<00:01:02.250> market<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> you've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.270> very

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the market and you've got to be very

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
the market and you've got to be very
creative<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.710> recruiting<00:01:05.369> players

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
creative when you're recruiting players

which<00:01:05.970> we're<00:01:06.119> gonna<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.330> done<00:01:06.420> extremely

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
which we're gonna have done extremely

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
which we're gonna have done extremely
well<00:01:07.159> over<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.280> last<00:01:08.520> few<00:01:08.729> years<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.479> it

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
well over these last few years but it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.020 
well over these last few years but it
won't<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.810> easy<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> replace<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
won't be easy for them to replace a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
won't be easy for them to replace a
player<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> impact<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
player of that kind of impact for them I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.289 
player of that kind of impact for them I
mean<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:14.220> made<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> massive<00:01:14.760> difference<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
mean he made a massive difference to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.140 
mean he made a massive difference to
them<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.799> seemingly<00:01:17.580> annual

escape at the end of the season there is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.399 
escape at the end of the season there is
still<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> reasonable<00:01:21.720> amount<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.020> quality

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
still a reasonable amount of quality

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.600 
still a reasonable amount of quality
through<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.770> scored<00:01:23.070> though<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.369> mean<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
through that scored though I mean do you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.039 
through that scored though I mean do you
think<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.479> they<00:01:24.570> should<00:01:24.840> be

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
think do you think they should be

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:25.580 
think do you think they should be
worried<00:01:25.320> about

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
worried about

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.990

relegation<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.700> it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
relegation or do you think actually it's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
relegation or do you think actually it's
a<00:01:27.060> squad<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.330> should<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.780> able<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.920> have

that bad start and find itself in a
position<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.950> bad<00:01:32.070> start<00:01:32.400> was

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
position well the bad start was

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.890 
position well the bad start was
particularly<00:01:32.909> bad<00:01:33.180> last<00:01:33.450> year<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.869> fact

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
particularly bad last year and in fact

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
particularly bad last year and in fact
in<00:01:34.170> many<00:01:34.259> ways<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.920> bad<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.369> know<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
in many ways it was so bad you know it's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.090 
in many ways it was so bad you know it's
only<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.570> fantastic<00:01:37.320> relationship<00:01:37.860> that

only the the fantastic relationship that
the<00:01:38.490> chairmen<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.030> indeed<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> club<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the chairmen and indeed the club as a

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.109 
the chairmen and indeed the club as a
whole<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.740> Martinez<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.030> know

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
whole have with Martinez that you know

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
whole have with Martinez that you know
it<00:01:42.420> wasn't<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> massive<00:01:43.350> question<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it wasn't really a massive question that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.789 
it wasn't really a massive question that
his<00:01:44.549> position<00:01:44.759> might<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.590> under<00:01:46.590> pressure

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
his position might be under pressure

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
his position might be under pressure
where<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.720> lost<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> think

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
where you know when they lost I think

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.100 
where you know when they lost I think
something<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.909> nine<00:01:50.909> games<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.750> their

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
something like nine games and in their

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.990 
something like nine games and in their
opening<00:01:52.500> run<00:01:52.710> then<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.700> together<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
opening run then got it together a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.730 
opening run then got it together a
little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.630> had<00:01:55.049> another<00:01:55.350> terrible

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
little bit then had another terrible

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.880 
little bit then had another terrible
losing<00:01:56.189> streak<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.700> January<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.689> yet<00:01:58.680> they

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
losing streak over January and yet they

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.670 
losing streak over January and yet they
trusted<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.210> man<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.530> through

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
trusted the man to see them through

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
trusted the man to see them through
which<00:02:01.979> Martinez<00:02:02.700> did<00:02:02.880> again<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> fine<00:02:03.540> style

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
which Martinez did again in fine style

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.200 
which Martinez did again in fine style
and<00:02:04.110> they<00:02:04.200> had<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> terrific<00:02:05.040> run<00:02:05.549> again<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and they had a terrific run again at the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.999 
and they had a terrific run again at the
end<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> season<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.899> some<00:02:07.079> some<00:02:07.890> more

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
end of the season with some some more

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.469 
end of the season with some some more
big<00:02:08.220> scouts<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> wasn't<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.000> long<00:02:09.179> ago<00:02:09.239> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
big scouts it wasn't that long ago that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.089 
big scouts it wasn't that long ago that
you<00:02:09.629> looked<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:09.959> Wigan<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.619> was<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> team

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
you looked at Wigan and there was a team

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.100 
you looked at Wigan and there was a team
who<00:02:11.250> famously<00:02:11.730> could<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.660> life<00:02:12.750> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
who famously could not for the life of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.700 
who famously could not for the life of
the<00:02:13.260> managed

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
the managed

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.310 
the managed
to<00:02:14.550> beat<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> big<00:02:15.240> four<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.900> now

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
to beat one of the big four and now

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.500 
to beat one of the big four and now
they've<00:02:16.770> beaten<00:02:17.520> more<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:17.820> less<00:02:17.940> everybody<00:02:18.180> in

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
they've beaten more or less everybody in

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
they've beaten more or less everybody in
that<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.720> think<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.650> situation<00:02:19.830> so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
that I think in that situation so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.670 
that I think in that situation so
they've<00:02:20.940> got<00:02:21.150> reason<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> feel<00:02:21.840> confidence<00:02:22.560> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
they've got reason to feel confidence in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.460 
they've got reason to feel confidence in
themselves<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.360> think<00:02:25.260> they'll<00:02:25.350> look

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
themselves but I think they'll look

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
themselves but I think they'll look
around<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> lot<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.430> teams<00:02:26.790> it's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
around and like a lot of teams it's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
around and like a lot of teams it's
really<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> case<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.630> first<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.380> foremost<00:02:28.710> if

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
really a case of first and foremost if

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.230 
really a case of first and foremost if
you<00:02:28.920> wanted<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.310> make<00:02:29.460> sure<00:02:29.610> you're<00:02:29.790> safe<00:02:30.000> he's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
you wanted to make sure you're safe he's

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.730 
you wanted to make sure you're safe he's
you're<00:02:30.600> saying<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:31.020> there<00:02:31.110> three<00:02:31.380> teams<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you're saying are there three teams that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.850 
you're saying are there three teams that
are<00:02:31.860> worse<00:02:32.010> than<00:02:32.250> us<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:34.080> may<00:02:34.380> be<00:02:34.440> we<00:02:34.800> can

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
are worse than us and it may be we can

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.040 
are worse than us and it may be we can
we'll<00:02:35.070> feel<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.420> know<00:02:36.540> confident

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
we'll feel that the you know confident

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.170 
we'll feel that the you know confident
enough<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.560> themselves<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:39.060> they

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
enough in themselves that because they

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.430 
enough in themselves that because they
Mena<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.600> know<00:02:39.720> what<00:02:39.870> they're<00:02:40.020> doing<00:02:40.290> now

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
Mena they know what they're doing now

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020 
Mena they know what they're doing now
that<00:02:40.770> they'd<00:02:41.130> hope<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.790> are<00:02:41.820> three

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that they'd hope that there are three

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.790 
that they'd hope that there are three
teams<00:02:42.210> worse<00:02:42.450> than<00:02:42.600> them<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:42.840> fact<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.470> reckon

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
teams worse than them in fact I reckon

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.220 
teams worse than them in fact I reckon
they've<00:02:44.520> reason<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.210> perhaps<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:46.020> they<00:02:46.110> can

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
they've reason to perhaps if they can

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.540 
they've reason to perhaps if they can
pull<00:02:46.410> themselves<00:02:46.560> together<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:47.040> bit<00:02:47.220> earlier

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
pull themselves together a bit earlier

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.940 
pull themselves together a bit earlier
this<00:02:47.670> time<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.480> aim<00:02:49.140> for<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.430> mid-table

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
this time a aim for more of a mid-table

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.490 
this time a aim for more of a mid-table
comfortable<00:02:52.950> situation
