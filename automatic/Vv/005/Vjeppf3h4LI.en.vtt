00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
most common question that we actually

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
most common question that we actually
get<00:00:27.300> asked<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.109> because<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.890> brand

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

and<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.609> assure<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.240> definitely<00:00:30.900> not

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and I assure you that's definitely not

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
and I assure you that's definitely not
the<00:00:31.170> case<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.590> mean<00:00:31.800> let<00:00:32.130> me<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> look<00:00:32.579> at

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the case I mean let me take a look at

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
the case I mean let me take a look at
this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.149> solo<00:00:33.510> boot<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:33.870> instance<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
this is solo boot for instance the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
this is solo boot for instance the
technology<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.000> goes<00:00:36.210> beyond<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.780> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
technology that just goes beyond just in

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
technology that just goes beyond just in
the<00:00:37.079> sole<00:00:37.350> itself<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.250> much<00:00:38.399> different

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the sole itself is so much different

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.100 
the sole itself is so much different
than<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.239> buy<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> cheaper

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
than what you would buy in the cheaper

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
than what you would buy in the cheaper
end<00:00:40.140> boot<00:00:40.530> rather<00:00:41.489> than<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.360> being<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
end boot rather than it be just being a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.959 
end boot rather than it be just being a
flat<00:00:42.930> sole<00:00:43.290> unit<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.460> obviously

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
flat sole unit and you know obviously

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.369 
flat sole unit and you know obviously
it's<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.300> good<00:00:45.480> vibe<00:00:45.660> RAM<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:46.260> rather

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it's got good vibe RAM to it but rather

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
it's got good vibe RAM to it but rather
than<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> flat<00:00:47.520> standard<00:00:47.969> sole

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
than it be just a flat standard sole

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
than it be just a flat standard sole
unit<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.350> designed<00:00:49.559> even

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
unit the way that it's designed even

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.380 
unit the way that it's designed even
though<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.550> doesn't<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
though it doesn't look like it is to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
though it doesn't look like it is to
actually<00:00:51.570> mimic<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.260> natural<00:00:52.860> footing<00:00:53.309> so

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually mimic your natural footing so

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160 
actually mimic your natural footing so
obviously<00:00:54.059> everyone<00:00:54.420> walks<00:00:54.840> differently

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
obviously everyone walks differently

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.990 
obviously everyone walks differently
everyone<00:00:55.829> has<00:00:55.980> different<00:00:56.190> pressure<00:00:56.640> points

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
everyone has different pressure points

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
everyone has different pressure points
when<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> comes<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.510> walking<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
when it comes to walking and what this

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.080 
when it comes to walking and what this
is<00:00:58.680> meant<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.070> basically<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.879> it's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is meant to do is basically the so it's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
is meant to do is basically the so it's
nice<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.449> rigid<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.469> meant

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
nice and rigid but it's actually meant

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
nice and rigid but it's actually meant
to<00:01:01.770> flex<00:01:02.010> with<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> basically<00:01:03.030> meaning

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to flex with you basically meaning

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
to flex with you basically meaning
you're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> walk<00:01:04.559> further<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.610> going

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you're going to walk further it's going

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.250 
you're going to walk further it's going
to<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.210> comfortable<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
to be more comfortable for you and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
to be more comfortable for you and
you're<00:01:07.409> probably<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> walk<00:01:08.130> faster<00:01:08.970> as

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you're probably going to walk faster as

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.300 
you're probably going to walk faster as
well<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.869> when<00:01:10.020> if<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.229> also<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> look<00:01:11.130> at

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
well and when if I also take a look at

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.149 
well and when if I also take a look at
this<00:01:11.520> moment<00:01:11.729> boot<00:01:12.290> you're<00:01:13.290> also<00:01:13.470> paying<00:01:13.860> for

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this moment boot you're also paying for

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.490 
this moment boot you're also paying for
the<00:01:14.250> quality<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.299> leather<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:16.350> be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the quality of the leather and to be

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
the quality of the leather and to be
fair<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> finish<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> actual<00:01:17.880> boot<00:01:18.090> so

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
fair the finish of the actual boot so

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.730 
fair the finish of the actual boot so
everything<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.810> fine<00:01:19.140> checked<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.619> mean

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
everything is fine checked I mean

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
everything is fine checked I mean
getting<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> cheaper<00:01:21.479> boots

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
getting in on some of the cheaper boots

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
getting in on some of the cheaper boots
they<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.930> tend<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> cut<00:01:22.560> cuts<00:01:22.830> too<00:01:23.220> rather<00:01:23.400> than

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
they do tend to cut cuts too rather than

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.740 
they do tend to cut cuts too rather than
just<00:01:23.729> having<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> whole<00:01:24.180> round<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.630> this

just having the whole round so on this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
just having the whole round so on this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
memory boot you've got a nice round

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
memory boot you've got a nice round
that's<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.600> around<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.080> actual

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that's all the way around the actual

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.350 
that's all the way around the actual
boot<00:01:28.619> some<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.430> cut<00:01:29.759> costs<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
boot some of them actually cut costs and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719 
boot some of them actually cut costs and
don't<00:01:31.079> add<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.340> or<00:01:32.579> they've

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
don't add it around the back or they've

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
don't add it around the back or they've
only<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> front<00:01:33.600> part<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
only got it in the front part and you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
only got it in the front part and you
know<00:01:34.320> claim<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> toe<00:01:35.220> box<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.299> yeah

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
know claim it as a toe box and but yeah

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.060 
know claim it as a toe box and but yeah
it's<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.750> proves<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> quality

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it's just proves to kind of the quality

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
it's just proves to kind of the quality
of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.729> know<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.170> built

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of the you know how well they're built

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
of the you know how well they're built
you<00:01:40.860> know<00:01:40.890> again<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.310> leather<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you know again the leather as well as a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
you know again the leather as well as a
real<00:01:42.509> key<00:01:42.810> importance<00:01:43.380> quite<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:43.890> of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
real key importance quite a lot of

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
real key importance quite a lot of
leather<00:01:44.159> boots<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.670> cheaper<00:01:45.149> tend<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
leather boots that cheaper tend to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
leather boots that cheaper tend to
probably<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.409> too<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.310> true<00:01:47.340> they're

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
probably be too good to be true they're

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
probably be too good to be true they're
either<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> fake<00:01:48.630> leather<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.140> they're<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> very

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
either a fake leather or they're a very

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.170 
either a fake leather or they're a very
fine<00:01:49.950> thin<00:01:50.399> level<00:01:50.700> which<00:01:50.790> means<00:01:50.970> they're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
fine thin level which means they're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.819 
fine thin level which means they're
going<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> crack<00:01:51.630> easily<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> they're<00:01:52.649> also

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
going to crack easily and they're also

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
going to crack easily and they're also
going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> dry<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.149> easily<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:54.750> well

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
going to dry up really easily as well

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
going to dry up really easily as well
also<00:01:55.320> means<00:01:55.740> they're<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.310> as

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
also means they're not going to be as

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.069 
also means they're not going to be as
waterproof<00:01:57.030> wear<00:01:57.570> isn't<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> get

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
waterproof wear isn't if you get

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
waterproof wear isn't if you get
something<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.649> Marut<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.399> worry

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
something like the Marut or don't worry

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.600 
something like the Marut or don't worry
even<00:01:59.759> say<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.600> Mindil<00:02:01.079> boot<00:02:01.290> here

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
even say it's the Mindil boot here

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.550 
even say it's the Mindil boot here
you've<00:02:02.610> got<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.090> good<00:02:03.329> quality<00:02:03.810> high<00:02:04.290> on

actually paying for the internal part so
the<00:02:26.100> fact<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.550> boot<00:02:26.730> has<00:02:26.880> gore-tex<00:02:27.600> is

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the fact that the boot has gore-tex is

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.780 
the fact that the boot has gore-tex is
such<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> key<00:02:28.380> importance<00:02:29.160> kneeling<00:02:29.700> and

and dry and the technology on this or
like<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.380> mindil<00:02:37.830> boot<00:02:37.980> here<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> has<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
like this mindil boot here it has a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.450 
like this mindil boot here it has a
memory<00:02:39.120> foam<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.020> actual<00:02:40.320> inside<00:02:40.770> part<00:02:41.220> of

memory foam on the actual inside part of
the<00:02:41.580> boot<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.330> be<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> really

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
the boot so it's going to be a really

the boot so it's going to be a really
really<00:02:43.710> nice<00:02:44.160> fit<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.360> even<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
really nice fit and so even if you you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
really nice fit and so even if you you
know<00:02:46.530> your<00:02:46.740> ankle<00:02:47.010> swells<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.460> during<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> day

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
know your ankle swells up during the day

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.700 
know your ankle swells up during the day
the<00:02:48.270> boot<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> react<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.380> if<00:02:49.560> you

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
the boot is going to react to it if you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.590 
the boot is going to react to it if you
were<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> thicker<00:02:50.250> pair<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.580> socks<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.240> boot<00:02:51.450> is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
were a thicker pair of socks the boot is
