00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it's pretty cool right so this is well

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.290 
it's pretty cool right so this is well
yes<00:00:47.329> it's<00:00:48.329> comparable<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.680> flip

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
yes it's comparable to like the flip

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.610 
yes it's comparable to like the flip
cameras<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.500> I've

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
cameras that they have out there so I've

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520 
cameras that they have out there so I've
got<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> Kodak<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:55.110> then<00:00:55.289> this

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
got the Kodak right here and then this

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.810 
got the Kodak right here and then this
is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.730> den<00:00:57.260> SMX

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
is the as den SMX

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.180 
is the as den SMX
10<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> number<00:01:00.539> I'll<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:02.039> sure

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
10 I think is the number I'll make sure

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.210 
10 I think is the number I'll make sure
and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:02.520> post<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.030> link<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:04.220> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and then post a link to that and and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
and then post a link to that and and
then<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.909> standard<00:01:06.119> flash

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
then this is just a standard flash

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
then this is just a standard flash
bracket<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.729> straight<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.390> there

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
bracket and just going straight in there

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.719 
bracket and just going straight in there
so<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.560> pretty<00:01:10.740> cool<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.159> small

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
so it's pretty cool it's really small

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.859 
so it's pretty cool it's really small
and<00:01:12.060> yet<00:01:12.950> got<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.130> pretty<00:01:14.369> good<00:01:14.869> quality

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and yet got some pretty good quality

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.130 
and yet got some pretty good quality
coming<00:01:16.320> from<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.920> let's<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.369> back<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:18.140> me

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
coming from it so let's go back to me

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
coming from it so let's go back to me
here<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
here to do and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
here to do and
yeah<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.900> pretty<00:01:22.439> stoked<00:01:22.890> about<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
yeah I'm pretty stoked about this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
yeah I'm pretty stoked about this
because<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.330> guy<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
because it's just a little guy but from

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.020 
because it's just a little guy but from
what<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:25.950> seen<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.400> image<00:01:26.610> quality<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what I've seen the image quality is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
what I've seen the image quality is
pretty<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.840> mean<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.500> no<00:01:28.650> zoom<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
pretty good I mean there's no zoom on it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
pretty good I mean there's no zoom on it
and<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and so it's not going to be like a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.670 
and so it's not going to be like a
replacement<00:01:32.270> for<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> normal<00:01:33.900> video<00:01:34.110> camera

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
replacement for a normal video camera

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.460 
replacement for a normal video camera
but<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.490> wanted<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.659> shot<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
doesn't have its place I don't really
feel<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.000> fetching<00:01:54.869> footage<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> all<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
feel like fetching footage in all the

feel like fetching footage in all the
time<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.460> timecode<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.229> dealing<00:01:58.229> with

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
time and with timecode and dealing with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.929 
time and with timecode and dealing with
mini<00:01:58.530> DV<00:01:58.890> tapes<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> everything<00:01:59.790> like<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
whereas this obviously solid state I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.340 
whereas this obviously solid state I
just<00:02:02.729> take<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> memory<00:02:03.840> card<00:02:03.899> pop

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
just take that out the memory card pop

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
just take that out the memory card pop
into<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.829> computer<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.729> I'm<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.619> plus

into my computer and I'm good to go plus

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
into my computer and I'm good to go plus
this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.799> smaller<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
this is smaller and just as I can do

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.620 
this is smaller and just as I can do
720p<00:02:10.800> instead<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.640> always<00:02:11.760> 1080p

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
720p instead of always 1080p

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.900 
720p instead of always 1080p
for<00:02:12.780> small<00:02:13.050> file<00:02:13.260> sizes<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.610> I'm<00:02:14.700> kind<00:02:14.880> of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
for small file sizes so I'm kind of

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.310 
for small file sizes so I'm kind of
excited<00:02:15.150> about<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.390> look<00:02:15.780> nice<00:02:15.930> little<00:02:16.200> guy

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
excited about this look nice little guy

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.650 
excited about this look nice little guy
might<00:02:16.770> be<00:02:16.800> fun<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.130> take<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.090> around<00:02:18.300> maybe

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
might be fun to take this around maybe

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.770 
might be fun to take this around maybe
if<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.770> some<00:02:20.550> events<00:02:21.420> or<00:02:21.510> something<00:02:21.720> like

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
if I go to some events or something like

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.880 
if I go to some events or something like
that<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:22.020> might<00:02:22.170> be<00:02:22.290> I'll<00:02:22.380> take<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.650> with

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that I might be I'll take this with

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.220 
that I might be I'll take this with
instead<00:02:23.250> I've<00:02:23.340> always<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.730> my<00:02:23.880> hb20<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.900> I

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
instead I've always have my hb20 and I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
instead I've always have my hb20 and I
can<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.530> flop<00:02:25.830> photos<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.340> easier<00:02:26.760> and
