slug and it has nuts and bolts and you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.850 
slug and it has nuts and bolts and you
think<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.690> theme<00:02:06.900> because<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> nuts<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
think it's theme because the nuts and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.340 
think it's theme because the nuts and
bolts<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:08.190> along<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> metal<00:02:09.060> yeah<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
bolts go along with the metal yeah this

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.620 
bolts go along with the metal yeah this
is<00:02:10.530> kinda<00:02:10.860> iffy<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.700> effect<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.120> fitting

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
is kinda iffy the effect is fitting

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.690 
is kinda iffy the effect is fitting
maybe<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.380> necessarily<00:02:13.950> fitting<00:02:14.400> enough

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700

most<00:03:26.579> people<00:03:26.820> don't<00:03:26.940> know<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.630> just<00:03:27.660> are

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
most people don't know that and just are

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.410 
most people don't know that and just are
like<00:03:28.410> oh<00:03:28.470> level<00:03:28.980> 42<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:29.880> good

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
like oh level 42 it's so good

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.050 
like oh level 42 it's so good
but<00:03:30.810> yes<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.440> was<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.560> origin<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.070> number<00:03:32.700> 42

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
but yes that was the origin of number 42

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780 
but yes that was the origin of number 42
being<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.450> good<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.870> then<00:03:34.410> number<00:03:35.010> 69<00:03:35.579> for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
being so good and then number 69 for

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.130 
being so good and then number 69 for
obvious<00:03:36.120> reasons<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:36.570> won't<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.900> into<00:03:37.049> that

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
obvious reasons I won't get into that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.949 
obvious reasons I won't get into that
one<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.650> number<00:03:38.459> 99<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.180> number<00:03:39.329> 100<00:03:39.780> just

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
one and number 99 and number 100 just

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.039 
one and number 99 and number 100 just
because<00:03:40.260> they<00:03:40.440> are<00:03:40.590> pretty<00:03:40.860> numbers<00:03:42.049> there

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
because they are pretty numbers there

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.930 
because they are pretty numbers there
are<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.200> few<00:03:43.380> others<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.400> generally

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
are a few others but this is generally

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.190 
are a few others but this is generally
the<00:03:44.970> list<00:03:45.299> you'll<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.540> looking<00:03:45.840> at<00:03:45.989> if

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
the list you'll be looking at if

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.380 
the list you'll be looking at if
someone's<00:03:46.530> asking<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:46.980> lot<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.400> keys<00:03:48.000> for<00:03:48.329> a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
someone's asking a lot of keys for a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.809 
someone's asking a lot of keys for a
craft<00:03:48.660> number

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
craft number

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.699 
craft number
crafts<00:03:50.450> numbers<00:03:50.780> are<00:03:50.900> often<00:03:51.200> put<00:03:51.409> into

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
crafts numbers are often put into

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.250 
crafts numbers are often put into
unusual<00:03:52.310> trades<00:03:52.609> as<00:03:52.879> extra<00:03:53.239> value<00:03:53.629> so<00:03:54.139> they

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
unusual trades as extra value so they

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.649 
unusual trades as extra value so they
get<00:03:54.379> passed<00:03:54.650> around<00:03:54.799> quite<00:03:55.189> a<00:03:55.219> lot<00:03:55.389> however<00:03:56.389> if

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
get passed around quite a lot however if

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.330 
get passed around quite a lot however if
a<00:03:56.780> craft<00:03:57.049> number<00:03:57.379> doesn't<00:03:57.769> have<00:03:57.920> one<00:03:58.159> of<00:03:58.189> the

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
a craft number doesn't have one of the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.520 
a craft number doesn't have one of the
special<00:03:58.700> numbers<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.209> mentioned<00:03:59.569> earlier<00:03:59.840> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
special numbers I mentioned earlier the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.110 
special numbers I mentioned earlier the
chances<00:04:00.889> that<00:04:00.920> someone<00:04:01.370> will<00:04:01.519> want<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.939> go

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
chances that someone will want it go

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.250 
chances that someone will want it go
down<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.659> ton<00:04:03.170> like<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.280> almost<00:04:04.579> zero<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.930> if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
down a ton like to almost zero so if

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.569 
down a ton like to almost zero so if
you're<00:04:06.469> offered<00:04:06.739> some<00:04:06.950> kind<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.280> mediocre

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
you're offered some kind of mediocre

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.819 
you're offered some kind of mediocre
craft<00:04:08.090> number<00:04:08.450> like<00:04:08.719> it's<00:04:08.959> in<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.109> 70s<00:04:09.680> or<00:04:09.799> 80s

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
craft number like it's in the 70s or 80s

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.009 
craft number like it's in the 70s or 80s
somewhere<00:04:10.579> not<00:04:11.239> really<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.569> pretty<00:04:11.840> number

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
somewhere not really a pretty number

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.080 
somewhere not really a pretty number
then<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.739> probably<00:04:12.950> wouldn't<00:04:13.310> take<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.639> unless

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
then I probably wouldn't take it unless

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.879 
then I probably wouldn't take it unless
it's<00:04:14.299> a<00:04:14.359> hat<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.750> really<00:04:15.049> like<00:04:15.319> since<00:04:15.769> it

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
could take at least a couple of weeks to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.830
