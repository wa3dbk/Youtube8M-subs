so I'm sure not only these two guys the
spinners<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.530> other<00:01:25.740> possible<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.310> gonna<00:01:26.520> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
spinners but other possible is gonna be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
spinners but other possible is gonna be
the<00:01:26.729> rule<00:01:26.939> isn't<00:01:27.590> no<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:29.040> place<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.340> them

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the rule isn't no more place to them

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.830 
the rule isn't no more place to them
nowadays<00:01:30.170> you<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> know<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
bigger as well as you see to mitigate

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.020 
bigger as well as you see to mitigate
the<00:01:38.369> ball<00:01:38.579> see<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:38.880> hard<00:01:39.149> for<00:01:39.390> long

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030

what<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:41.020> happen<00:01:41.050> before<00:01:41.410> with<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> 50

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
what is to happen before with the 50

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.010 
what is to happen before with the 50

over game where they used to have a
softer<00:01:44.410> ball<00:01:44.590> especially<00:01:44.770> after<00:01:45.250> 30<00:01:45.670> years

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
always say more needs to be plated fewer

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.100 
always say more needs to be plated fewer
than<00:01:48.340> when<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> ball<00:01:49.210> gets<00:01:49.390> off<00:01:49.690> that's<00:01:50.020> the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
than when the ball gets off that's the

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.990 
than when the ball gets off that's the
difference<00:01:50.440> between<00:01:50.530> 10<00:01:51.430> meters<00:01:51.790> and

yeah people talk about it's a batsman
became<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.709> that's<00:02:14.920> why<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.130> bullet<00:02:15.520> when

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
became but that's why the bullet when

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.550 
became but that's why the bullet when
you<00:02:15.820> because<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.180> not<00:02:16.300> move<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
you because it's not move if you have a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
you because it's not move if you have a
boy<00:02:17.770> who<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.190> actually<00:02:20.820> perfect<00:02:21.820> slower<00:02:22.060> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
boy who can actually perfect slower and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.870 
boy who can actually perfect slower and
can<00:02:22.900> reach<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> game<00:02:23.410> game<00:02:23.890> properly<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.520> think

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
can reach the game game properly I think

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.270
