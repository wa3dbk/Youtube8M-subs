more time Adam so this is the Nick I did

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.729 
more time Adam so this is the Nick I did
it<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> 100<00:01:02.010> BPM<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.550> now<00:01:03.210> let's<00:01:03.570> explain<00:01:04.530> what

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
it in 100 BPM and now let's explain what

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.590 
it in 100 BPM and now let's explain what
I'm<00:01:04.860> doing<00:01:05.100> first<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.970> scale<00:01:06.240> i'm

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
I'm doing first of all the scale i'm

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.399 
I'm doing first of all the scale i'm
using<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> Dorian<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:11.750> Dorian<00:01:12.750> we

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
using is a Dorian so it's a Dorian we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.590 
using is a Dorian so it's a Dorian we
have<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.770> b<00:01:14.369> c<00:01:14.640> d<00:01:15.090> e<00:01:15.869> f<00:01:16.290> sharp<00:01:16.909> major<00:01:17.909> 6th<00:01:18.420> and

have a b c d e f sharp major 6th and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.980 
have a b c d e f sharp major 6th and
minor<00:01:19.020> 7<00:01:19.439> g<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.509> b<00:01:21.509> c<00:01:21.780> d<00:01:22.290> e<00:01:22.860> F<00:01:23.460> sharp<00:01:23.520> G<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
minor 7 g so it's a b c d e F sharp G a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.420 
minor 7 g so it's a b c d e F sharp G a
