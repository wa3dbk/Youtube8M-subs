00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.740
 for 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 to 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.670
 after a few days ago there is then a surprise here it is - &amp; gt 900 name 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.960
 temporary procedure this product. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.919
 gd900 is an innovative product first of all as regards the 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.349
 material with which it is built is a material 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.899
 completely transparent 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.180
 we have the keyboard that basically there is no I see I don't see the 3 a 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.879
 particularity 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.600
 which allowed us to introduce also on the keyboard uu check mark 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.429
 practically therefore we have a tacere in main from 3 inches in the part 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.840
 top and a further tac scrin in the keyboard part so this one 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.699
 virtuosity that we have introduced with transparency is not an end in itself 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:51.149
 sea 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 acutil and for what it concerns the use of every day 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.530
 first of all 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.560
 offers to 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.590
 doctors help 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.309
 an interface 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 therefore I now know you then a keyboard 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.570
 which naturally vibrates at the pressure of the keys in reality the rates 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 they simply touch 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.070
 and therefore allows you to type numbers allows you to write sms as it has 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.050
 used to do 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.780
 this keyboard becomes a replacement or an integral part of the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.180
 interfaces class we have already seen in the arena so also in this case 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.760
 we have 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.300
 our cube our cube interface faces can be scrolled 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.620
 directly crawling strand on the screen but also rubbing finger on the 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.680
 keyboard 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.560
 this keyboard can be 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.540
 very useful to change from one screen to another then 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.759
 but also to write sms using handwriting recognition 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 to miss the settings for example in the camera 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.479
 using the combination of the two screens when moving links 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.420
 counterclockwise at times on the keyboard or use 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.050
