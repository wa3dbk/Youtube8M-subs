00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good day now we will do 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.200
 fish 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:15.030
 for making fish we need two 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:20.039
 red 9 strong 31 orange 47 black 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:25.130
 and 70 yellow modules are starting 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:31.730
 made take 2 modules of red and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.730
 we connect them with three modules yellow 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.450
 so the next we go 4 modules yellow 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:24.649
 so now in the middle one black 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.649
 set and 4 yellow 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.610
 as you noticed that it is extremely to increase 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.799
 we are extremely freaked out and like one 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.100
 pocket and the second pocket is empty of us 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:50.149
 it turns out so now we put on 5 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.149
 modules yellow 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.130
 no here we have 5 fail 6 mod 6 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.130
 yellow 2 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 45 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:30.110
 66 yellow ones like this 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:33.379
 the next row we make 7 modules black 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.360
 and the next 8 black modules that is 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:40.970
 Now we will put all the black modules 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:44.599
 then 8 like this now two rows yellow 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.909
 we will do one row of 9 modules 2 years 10 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:52.269
 modules the first row comes 9 modules from 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.890
 roles then we will be these 10 modules 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:00.349
 the next 2 rows we go black 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:06.099
 modules first row put 11 modules 2 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:09.400
 years of 12 modules that we get 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:14.450
 next row 2 rows next we will 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:20.889
 lead yellow modules first row goes 13 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.139
 modules 4 2 row 14 modules yellow 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:27.489
 so the next row we add around the edges 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.489
 2 yellow modules 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:47.370
 from this edge but also here 2 1 module goes 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.640
 corner in one pocket for 2 normal 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:57.450
 usually and in the middle we put 3 yellow 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:00.360
 module look and that here was 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:07.320
 in the middle exactly in the middle of nki 2 yellow 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:17.070
 module now put 4 black 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:17.669
 modules on these 3 little ones that we 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.790
 dressed 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.270
 raise 4 blacks here we do it 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:31.650
 to corner 1 and shows a pocket 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:36.210
 the second pocket will be empty here 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:40.640
 so now we are now 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.640
 put 5 blue modules 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.220
 on the edges, too, dress in this way 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:05:00.280
 so that one pocket we have left 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.280
 empty like this 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.160
 the next 2 rows we will lead from 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.160
 orange modules 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:21.940
 dress 6 orange first row next 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.940
 row 7 orange 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:30.500
 thus 6 7 orange 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:35.330
 so now at the edges of the fast add by 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:41.810
 one module from this side and this one 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:49.190
 sides here and one more module 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:52.240
 add with the edge here it is with us 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.940
 it turns tail 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.599
 Now we will make fins to her to 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.479
 this of our angelfish means fins 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:07.900
 we will do this 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:07.900
 We dress on the edge of two black 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:29.440
 two blacks now two blue ones 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:32.130
 our pocket is empty like this 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.130
 two blue 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:43.750
 3 rows do 2 orange also 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:47.100
 It turns out here one pocket is empty 3 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.100
 rows do 2 orange 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.780
 them at the end of 1 orange set here with this 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.620
 side fin ready out also do with 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:22.190
 this side please we have a fish 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:26.270
 angelfish ready this fish can 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:29.220
 use as a Christmas tree toy 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.789
 so that you can hold on tight 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.789
