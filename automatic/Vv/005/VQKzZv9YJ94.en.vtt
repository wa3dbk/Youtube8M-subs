for<00:00:20.279> working<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.640> Photoshop<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.650> can

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
for working in Photoshop now you can

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.279 
for working in Photoshop now you can
certainly<00:00:23.070> use<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.510> your<00:00:24.510> computer<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
certainly use your your computer and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.370 
certainly use your your computer and
mouse<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.689> millions<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> people<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:28.230> that

mouse and millions of people do that
every<00:00:28.680> day<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> want<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.820> have

every day but if you want to get have
some<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.320> fine<00:00:31.800> level<00:00:32.279> control

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
some really really fine level control

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
some really really fine level control
over<00:00:33.719> your<00:00:33.930> image<00:00:34.079> manipulation<00:00:34.680> in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
over your image manipulation in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
over your image manipulation in
Photoshop<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
Photoshop you really need to have some

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
Photoshop you really need to have some
sort<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> digitizing<00:00:38.040> tablet<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.030> case

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sort of a digitizing tablet in this case

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750 
sort of a digitizing tablet in this case
all<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.930> say<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.190> tablet<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
all it is is say it's it's a tablet and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.700 
all it is is say it's it's a tablet and
they<00:00:41.910> into<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.690> pen<00:00:43.230> which<00:00:44.219> functions<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:46.500> an

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
they into a pen which functions as as an

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
they into a pen which functions as as an
editing<00:00:47.010> tool<00:00:47.420> I'll<00:00:48.420> show<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> mean

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
editing tool I'll show you what I mean

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.090 
editing tool I'll show you what I mean
now<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.520> were<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.940> take<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.510> picture<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:55.100> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
now if I were to take this picture and I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
now if I were to take this picture and I
wanted<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.469> don't<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.770> example<00:01:00.620> draw

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
wanted to I don't know for example draw

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
wanted to I don't know for example draw
a<00:01:01.649> mustache<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:04.309> well<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> could<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a mustache on it well I could do that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.980 
a mustache on it well I could do that
with<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.659> with<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.890> mouse<00:01:09.320> if<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
with my with my mouse if I really had to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.070 
with my with my mouse if I really had to
I'd<00:01:12.990> make<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> pretty<00:01:13.409> bad<00:01:13.890> mess<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:15.080> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I'd make a pretty bad mess with it but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.289 
I'd make a pretty bad mess with it but
if<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.320> were<00:01:16.439> using<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.890> digitizing<00:01:17.610> tablet<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
if I were using a digitizing tablet it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.109 
if I were using a digitizing tablet it
really<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.229> drawing<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.220> pen

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really is just like drawing with a pen

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.920 
really is just like drawing with a pen
on<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> piece<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.990> paper<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:23.509> know<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
on a piece of paper you know this is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
on a piece of paper you know this is
perhaps<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> best<00:01:28.860> example<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.460> I'm

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
perhaps not the best example what I'm

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.700 
perhaps not the best example what I'm
talking<00:01:29.970> about

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
talking about

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:40.300 
talking about
so<00:01:31.710> let<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:31.920> show<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:36.180> blank<00:01:36.750> image

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.920 

what<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.720> were<00:01:42.780> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
what you can do with a know if I were to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.050 
what you can do with a know if I were to
try<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> write<00:01:43.350> my<00:01:43.560> name<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.899> mouse

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.030 

it<00:01:52.659> can<00:01:52.810> be<00:01:52.899> done<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.320> as<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.649> can<00:01:53.770> see<00:01:53.920> it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
it can be done and as you can see it's

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.499 
it can be done and as you can see it's
quite<00:01:54.220> tedious<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.540> cumbersome<00:01:55.990> whoops<00:01:56.829> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
quite tedious and cumbersome whoops and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.870 
quite tedious and cumbersome whoops and
it's<00:01:58.509> very<00:01:58.720> easy<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.140> make<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.640> serious<00:02:00.640> mistake

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's very easy to make a serious mistake

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
it's very easy to make a serious mistake
like<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.799> whereas<00:02:02.799> again<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.939> the<00:02:04.119> tablet

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
like that whereas again with the tablet

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.410 
like that whereas again with the tablet
it's<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.250> I'm<00:02:06.399> drawing<00:02:06.789> on<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> piece<00:02:07.390> of

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
it's just like I'm drawing on a piece of

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.290 
it's just like I'm drawing on a piece of
paper<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:16.090> also

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
paper and you and it's also

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.330 
paper and you and it's also
pressure-sensitive<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.190> increase

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
pressure-sensitive so as you increase

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.820 
pressure-sensitive so as you increase
the<00:02:18.610> pressure<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:21.519> gets<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.180> like<00:02:22.830> like

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
the pressure it gets to be like like

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.180 
the pressure it gets to be like like
you're<00:02:23.980> using<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:25.620> any<00:02:26.620> other<00:02:26.769> artists<00:02:27.310> tool

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
you're using a any other artists tool

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.220 
you're using a any other artists tool
and<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:30.910> by<00:02:31.090> use<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.989> use<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
and you can just by use if you use the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
and you can just by use if you use the
right<00:02:32.410> brush<00:02:35.310> simply<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.489> pressure<00:02:37.420> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
right brush simply the the pressure of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.420 
right brush simply the the pressure of
your<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:40.810> pen<00:02:43.860> changes<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> thickness

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
your of your pen changes the thickness

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.039 
your of your pen changes the thickness
and<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.200> attributes<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> brush

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
and the attributes of the of the brush

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.600
