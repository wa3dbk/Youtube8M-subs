00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.670
 Y 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 there are 24 hours left 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.950
 as the star approaches 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.680
 to land two things happen the 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.830
 core and the crust of the earth 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 they would begin to heat up and melt 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.890
 this would cause earthquakes of a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.130
 never seen magnitude 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.680
 then the gravitational field of 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.300
 the neutron star would begin to 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.300
 crack our planet 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.400
 as for the atmosphere the oceans and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.740
 the earth's crust will begin to 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.740
 flutter people would die very fast 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.950
 I think the bark would start to be made 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.840
 pieces the hot interior of the planet 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.840
 it would be poured into the void of space 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.730
 for the neutron star would 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.250
 you shred the earth but at that moment 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.300
 all people would already be dead 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.840
 by radiation 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 volcanoes or other causes of form 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.180
 that there would not be anyone to witness the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.180
 phenomenon except the passengers of the ark 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.230
 i 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.879
 ah 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.920
 the material of the earth torn up 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.080
 can do two things or rush 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.730
 about the neutron star and 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.730
 cause a colossal explosion 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.130
 or will begin to orbit around the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.130
 star 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.269
 so that our planet could 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.269
 become an orbital system 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.489
 Earth 2.0 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.379
 88 years later 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.760
 who will be there when we get the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.090
 current human life expectancy is 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.640
 about 70 years old so when we got to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.380
 that distant planet most likely is 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.830
 that the people who boarded the archer 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.140
 is no longer obviously alive those who 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.000
 they were between 50 and 60 years old at the beginning 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.980
 of the trip they would not see his end 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.689
 surely the children would be left 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.879
 little ones 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.069
 it's easy to imagine that as a 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.449
 very emotional experience because they knew 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.759
 that have reached the end of their long 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.289
 trip and that have been successful but of 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.769
 some way that I would just be the 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.769
 beginning 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.400
 imagine the emotions that these people 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.680
 I would feel when I first saw the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.020
 surface of that planet but then 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.400
 his work would be even more important already 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.530
 that they would have to disembark and 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.250
 rebuild human civilization in a 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.250
 new world 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.350
 and a lot of people could say think about 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.720
 the construction of an interstellar ark 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.850
 to evacuate the planet is a loss 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.500
 of time I'm not sure it's 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.110
 something that we should use a lot of 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.340
 effort in the absence of a threat but 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.710
 it is certainly something that we should 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.180
 pose to us because it is inevitable that in 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.340
 some time in the future we want 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.340
 leave the planet I hope that without being 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.990
 forced by a catastrophe is a 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.470
 madness think it looks like science 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.210
 fiction the end of the world that we have 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.520
 to evacuate the earth because there is not 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.620
 possible escape though in reality 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.540
 it's impossible to say that something like that 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.820
 will happen in the course of our 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.740
 lives is also interesting to think about 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.470
 because everything comes down to the question of whether 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.210
 as a species we can expand more 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.520
 beyond the confines of the planet that we 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.290
 gave life if you look at evolution 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.450
 from the earth often the big 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.670
 migrations and expansions of a species 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.310
 they start because of some disaster that 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:17.270
 forces that species to advance the same 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.040
 could happen to us it could be 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.380
 that a phenomenon as catastrophic as 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.980
 that was precisely the one 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.960
 thus provides our 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.360
 and the possibility of lasting for 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.360
 always spreading through the universe
