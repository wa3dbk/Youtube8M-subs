00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.510
 how about youtube friends as the day of 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.050
 today obama talks about UFOs and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.050
 years 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.140
 when the whole political campaign 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.750
 everything becomes more idealistic it becomes 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.610
 more interesting becomes more 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.170
 forming more fun for the 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.850
 politicians and sometimes also for 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.500
 the people 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.240
 obama a few days ago came out with 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.870
 a talk was waving to the public 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.380
 and in one of those about a person who 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.150
 he speaks to you in the language of the deaf 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.360
 mute and 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.420
 is a comment tells you what is 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.940
 someone who supports him and he tells him that 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.430
 thank you I pray the signal and well then with 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.140
 that will be thousands of people who 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.120
 really good the video was natural 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.620
 it is quite interesting then and if it was 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.260
 fact planned previously good as not 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.810
 we know it but the thing is that this guy 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.010
 of videos emerge and they can lift 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.400
 or they can knock a candidate 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.980
 and today it is announced that obama 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.860
 was visiting roswell a municipality 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.400
 very small a small city around 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.560
 of 50 thousand inhabitants and how good is everything 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.490
 the world we know that's where it is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.829
 talk about chrome 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.280
 a clash of aliens and that there is a 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.970
 place a place where they are saved big 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.040
 secrets in reference to what it has 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 to do with the theme of the aliens and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.850
 UFOs 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.670
 and Suarez comments but the only thing 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.920
 He said there is not denied that it has been 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.619
 something in the rose well that is called 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.470
 surprise not only that what he mentions 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.539
 rather, he could not talk that 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.820
 Well now I could not say much to 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.340
 respect then in a way also 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.259
 funny in a way like 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.330
 regarding that also with the subject 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.700
 I imagine it was also a visit more 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 as no advertising 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.739
 a president who dares to go to rodwell 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.560
 and that goes publicly talking about 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.129
 theme or me because surely it will win 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.760
 a lot of people and what good is this kind of 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.819
 issues are nothing more than mexico or 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.709
 Latin America or Spain but in 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.569
 everyone the whole world is given this 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.180
 wave that are in the campaign and the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.640
 politicians become your great friends 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.890
 and they all become fun and 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.470
 we had a year or more than a year of 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.220
 listen to an obama because he has already bored a 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.900
 little serious this for the bad news and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.660
 is he was like losing that that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.549
 charismatic part with which he arrived now 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.610
 same is like recovering the I believe 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.070
 that I had it saved for 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.190
 well this campaign for your second 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.620
 mandate and we'll see what happens for another 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.570
 side the republicans apparently not 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.350
 they agree they are already talking about 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.090
 made some that would try to draw a 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.000
 surprise presidential candidate 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.210
 because they are not very popular with those who 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.610
 they are winning and the vote of the 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.110
 Republicans remain popular 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.450
 inside the Republicans but outside 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.670
 there are no longer popular then are 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.120
 looking for republicans that are 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 popular inside and outside even if they are not 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.250
 the number one within the pro public 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.870
 we are going to see what happens I do not think that 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 are going to let a candidate enter 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.060
 I doubt it a lot and I think it's going to 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.760
 enter one of the two inhabit numbers 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.020
 one that are there fighting for the vote 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.490
 not the internal vote 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.250
 so well let's be here 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.050
 commenting on all this and let's see 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.750
 how charismatic is the matter 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.380
 also in mexico 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.380
 see you later
