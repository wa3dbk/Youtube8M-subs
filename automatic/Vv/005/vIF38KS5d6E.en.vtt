00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
underpinning knowledge we have very

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.350 
underpinning knowledge we have very
experienced<00:02:22.400> paramedic<00:02:22.820> tutors<00:02:23.180> who<00:02:23.330> are

experienced paramedic tutors who are

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.660 
experienced paramedic tutors who are
paramedics<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.320> we're<00:02:24.470> obviously<00:02:24.590> still<00:02:24.830> out

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
paramedics and we're obviously still out

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.610 
paramedics and we're obviously still out
there<00:02:25.910> practicing<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.690> throughout<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
there practicing that throughout the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.170 
there practicing that throughout the
year<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.370> were<00:02:28.460> also<00:02:28.610> very<00:02:28.850> strong

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
year we were also very strong

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.750 
year we were also very strong
academically<00:02:29.780> as<00:02:29.990> well<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:31.310> find<00:02:31.640> that

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
academically as well and we find that

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.050 
academically as well and we find that
that<00:02:32.410> teaching<00:02:33.410> actually<00:02:33.800> helps<00:02:34.580> develop<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that teaching actually helps develop the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.790 
that teaching actually helps develop the
practitioner<00:02:35.690> because<00:02:35.990> it's<00:02:36.140> not<00:02:36.410> just<00:02:36.710> a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
practitioner because it's not just a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.620 
practitioner because it's not just a
traditional<00:02:37.000> academic<00:02:38.000> program<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:38.540> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
traditional academic program it's a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.110 
traditional academic program it's a
professional<00:02:39.200> program<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> has<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.970> have

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
professional program so it has to have

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.880 
professional program so it has to have
the<00:02:41.420> practical<00:02:41.810> elements<00:02:41.930> as<00:02:42.350> well<00:02:42.530> the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
the practical elements as well the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.930 
the practical elements as well the
highlight<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> course<00:02:43.550> for<00:02:43.820> me

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
highlight of the course for me

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.570 
highlight of the course for me
personally<00:02:44.240> has<00:02:44.930> been<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.980> first<00:02:46.220> response

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
personally has been that first response

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.300

the team that's going to help somebody

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.540 
the team that's going to help somebody
the<00:02:56.210> first<00:02:56.450> time<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.900> happens<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:58.070> really

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
the first time that happens it really

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.280 
the first time that happens it really
stays<00:02:58.820> with<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.360> takes<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.690> lot<00:02:59.840> to

stays with you and it takes a lot to
beat<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:02.030> lecturers<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.720> my<00:03:03.230> team<00:03:03.470> will

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
beat that the lecturers the my team will

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.550 
beat that the lecturers the my team will
deliver<00:03:03.950> probably<00:03:04.640> 90%<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.600> program<00:03:05.990> is

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
deliver probably 90% of the program is

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.620 
deliver probably 90% of the program is
paramedic<00:03:06.920> focused<00:03:07.490> but<00:03:08.120> obviously<00:03:08.390> when

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
paramedic focused but obviously when

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.450 
paramedic focused but obviously when
we're<00:03:08.780> dealing<00:03:08.900> with<00:03:09.380> areas<00:03:09.890> such<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:10.070> mental

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
we're dealing with areas such as mental

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.710 
we're dealing with areas such as mental
health<00:03:10.490> when<00:03:11.210> we're<00:03:11.330> dealing<00:03:11.420> with

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
health when we're dealing with

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.810 
health when we're dealing with
obstetrics<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.650> childbirth<00:03:13.070> then<00:03:13.550> obviously

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
obstetrics and childbirth then obviously

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.570 
obstetrics and childbirth then obviously
the<00:03:14.360> expertise<00:03:14.900> is<00:03:15.620> better<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:16.100> come<00:03:16.280> from

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
the expertise is better to come from

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.980 
the expertise is better to come from
people<00:03:17.060> who<00:03:17.120> have<00:03:17.270> registered<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:17.870> that

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
people who have registered in that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.600 
people who have registered in that
profession<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.650> for<00:03:18.860> example<00:03:19.190> we'll<00:03:19.310> use<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
profession so for example we'll use the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.210 
profession so for example we'll use the
midwifery<00:03:20.060> team<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.690> do<00:03:21.410> all<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.770> emergency

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
midwifery team to do all the emergency

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.800 
midwifery team to do all the emergency
obstetric<00:03:22.310> swip<00:03:22.910> then<00:03:23.150> we<00:03:23.390> use<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.660> medical

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
obstetric swip then we use the medical

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.630 
obstetric swip then we use the medical
teams<00:03:24.380> come<00:03:24.620> in<00:03:24.680> deliver<00:03:25.070> sessions<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.580> we

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
teams come in deliver sessions and we

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.310 
teams come in deliver sessions and we
also<00:03:25.820> use<00:03:26.240> a<00:03:26.270> lot<00:03:26.570> of<00:03:26.600> guest<00:03:26.900> speakers<00:03:27.230> from

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
also use a lot of guest speakers from

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.570 
also use a lot of guest speakers from

the ambulance service as well

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.220 
the ambulance service as well
the<00:03:28.820> cost<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.240> definitely<00:03:29.690> meeting<00:03:30.110> my

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the cost is definitely meeting my

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.770 
the cost is definitely meeting my
expectations<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:31.370> not<00:03:31.550> it's<00:03:32.000> superseding<00:03:32.660> of
