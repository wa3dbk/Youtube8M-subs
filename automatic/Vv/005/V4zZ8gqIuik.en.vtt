there's<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.719> lot<00:01:40.960> more<00:01:41.229> variation<00:01:41.469> in

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
there's a lot more variation in

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.770 
there's a lot more variation in
environments<00:01:42.609> and<00:01:42.759> in<00:01:42.939> enemies<00:01:43.329> this<00:01:43.569> time

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
environments and in enemies this time

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.870 
environments and in enemies this time
around<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.679> whereas<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.189> first<00:01:45.369> game<00:01:45.609> was

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
around so whereas the first game was

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.819 
around so whereas the first game was
very<00:01:46.119> drab<00:01:46.569> a<00:01:46.600> lot<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.049> brown<00:01:47.200> colors<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.679> there

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
very drab a lot of brown colors in there

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.800 
very drab a lot of brown colors in there
everything<00:01:48.429> is<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.579> lot<00:01:48.819> more<00:01:48.969> brightness<00:01:49.329> and

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
everything is a lot more brightness and

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.559 
everything is a lot more brightness and
contrast<00:01:49.990> now<00:01:50.499> and<00:01:50.829> even<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.729> set<00:01:51.939> pieces<00:01:52.240> are

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
contrast now and even the set pieces are

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.359 
contrast now and even the set pieces are
all<00:01:52.689> created<00:01:53.109> on<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> much<00:01:53.499> grander<00:01:53.829> scale<00:01:54.340> than

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
all created on a much grander scale than

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.879 
all created on a much grander scale than
before<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.149> of<00:01:55.749> course<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> big

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
before and of course one of the big

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.709 
before and of course one of the big
complaints<00:01:57.369> from<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.609> previous<00:01:57.939> game<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.389> the

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
complaints from the previous game is the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.690 
complaints from the previous game is the
lack<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.899> variation<00:01:59.469> in<00:01:59.619> enemies<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.280> so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
lack of variation in enemies and so

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.429 
lack of variation in enemies and so
gearbox<00:02:01.119> has<00:02:01.359> really<00:02:01.689> done<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.840> lot<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.200> kind<00:02:02.350> of

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
gearbox has really done a lot to kind of

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.620 
gearbox has really done a lot to kind of
ramp<00:02:02.649> that<00:02:02.829> up<00:02:02.889> in<00:02:03.639> this<00:02:03.789> particular<00:02:04.270> level

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
ramp that up in this particular level

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.029 
ramp that up in this particular level
you'll<00:02:04.810> see<00:02:04.869> a<00:02:04.990> lot<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.200> these<00:02:05.350> crystallis

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
you'll see a lot of these crystallis

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.750 
you'll see a lot of these crystallis
enemies

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
enemies

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.880 
enemies
and<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.210> basic<00:02:07.480> strategy<00:02:07.900> here<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.650> go<00:02:08.740> for

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
and the basic strategy here is to go for

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.380 
and the basic strategy here is to go for
their<00:02:08.980> weak<00:02:09.190> spot<00:02:09.490> which<00:02:09.730> are<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.910> crystals

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
their weak spot which are the crystals

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.660 
their weak spot which are the crystals
on<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.840> bottom<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.200> their<00:02:11.350> feet<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.130> this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
on the bottom of their feet and this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.610 
on the bottom of their feet and this
speaks<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.090> lot<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.960> overall<00:02:13.990> strategy

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
speaks a lot to the overall strategy

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
speaks a lot to the overall strategy
involved<00:02:15.460> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.640> game<00:02:15.820> every<00:02:16.180> enemy<00:02:16.540> is

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
involved in the game every enemy is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.090 
involved in the game every enemy is
gonna<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.050> different<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.500> vulnerabilities

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
gonna have different and vulnerabilities

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.620 
gonna have different and vulnerabilities
that<00:02:18.340> you'll<00:02:18.460> have<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.640> discover<00:02:19.090> eventually

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
that you'll have to discover eventually

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.110 
that you'll have to discover eventually
so<00:02:20.290> for<00:02:20.530> instance<00:02:20.860> Maya's<00:02:21.190> gun<00:02:21.430> skills<00:02:21.760> rely

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
so for instance Maya's gun skills rely

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.870 
so for instance Maya's gun skills rely
heavily<00:02:22.360> on<00:02:22.600> elemental<00:02:23.500> weapons<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.100> if<00:02:24.790> you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
heavily on elemental weapons and if you

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.030 
heavily on elemental weapons and if you
happen<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.180> glance<00:02:25.420> at<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.140> weapons<00:02:26.530> menu<00:02:26.860> or

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
happen to glance at the weapons menu or

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.410 
happen to glance at the weapons menu or
lay<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> demo<00:02:27.520> you'd<00:02:27.760> see<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.090> actually

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
lay on the demo you'd see that actually

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.330 
lay on the demo you'd see that actually
two<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.990> four<00:02:29.170> weapons<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.710> currently<00:02:30.040> have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
two of the four weapons I currently have

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.430 
two of the four weapons I currently have
equipped<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:31.120> heavy<00:02:31.480> amounts<00:02:32.020> of<00:02:32.140> corrosive

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
equipped do heavy amounts of corrosive

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.140 
equipped do heavy amounts of corrosive
damage<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.100> those<00:02:33.550> are<00:02:33.670> gonna<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.850> pretty

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
damage and those are gonna be pretty

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.030 
damage and those are gonna be pretty
much<00:02:34.300> useless<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.990> any<00:02:35.140> enemies<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.710> area

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
much useless to any enemies in this area

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.610 
much useless to any enemies in this area
since<00:02:36.490> we<00:02:36.700> are<00:02:36.820> in<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> caustic<00:02:37.390> caverns<00:02:37.720> so

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
since we are in the caustic caverns so

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.260 
since we are in the caustic caverns so
instead<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.040> gonna<00:02:39.190> want<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> refocus<00:02:39.820> my

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
instead I'm gonna want to refocus my

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.090 
instead I'm gonna want to refocus my
strategy<00:02:40.780> more<00:02:40.960> on<00:02:41.200> using<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.620> phase<00:02:41.860> lock

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
strategy more on using the phase lock

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.640 
strategy more on using the phase lock
ability<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:42.700> my<00:02:43.180> ranged<00:02:43.660> weapons<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:44.470> this

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
ability and my ranged weapons like this

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
ability and my ranged weapons like this
rocket<00:02:45.130> launcher<00:02:45.460> that<00:02:45.700> has<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> really<00:02:46.180> high

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
rocket launcher that has a really high

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:56.600 
rocket launcher that has a really high
chance<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.930> causing<00:02:47.140> explosions

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.710 

so<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> great<00:02:57.879> thing<00:02:57.910> about<00:02:58.180> playing<00:02:58.360> Maya

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
so the great thing about playing Maya

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420 
so the great thing about playing Maya
and<00:02:59.019> co-op<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.739> she<00:02:59.890> makes<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.129> really

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and co-op is that she makes a really

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.640 
and co-op is that she makes a really
great<00:03:00.879> support<00:03:01.180> character<00:03:01.870> she's<00:03:02.349> got<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.500> lot

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
great support character she's got a lot

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.410 
great support character she's got a lot
of<00:03:02.680> healing<00:03:03.069> properties<00:03:03.340> some<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> which<00:03:04.239> he

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
of healing properties some of which he

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.940 
of healing properties some of which he
will<00:03:04.540> recognize<00:03:04.840> from<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.230> first<00:03:05.500> game<00:03:05.739> not

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
will recognize from the first game not

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.009 
will recognize from the first game not
gonna<00:03:06.069> say<00:03:06.250> which<00:03:06.370> ones<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.940> she's<00:03:07.690> also<00:03:07.840> got

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
gonna say which ones and she's also got

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.050 
gonna say which ones and she's also got
a<00:03:08.080> lot<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> passive<00:03:08.830> skills<00:03:09.160> meant<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.730> augment

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
a lot of passive skills meant to augment

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.910 
a lot of passive skills meant to augment
her<00:03:10.239> phase-lock<00:03:10.870> ability<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> one<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.860> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
her phase-lock ability and one of the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.009 
her phase-lock ability and one of the
ones<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.129> we<00:03:12.310> chose<00:03:12.549> in<00:03:12.819> this<00:03:13.150> demo<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
ones that we chose in this demo is the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.470 
ones that we chose in this demo is the
converged<00:03:14.500> skill<00:03:14.920> which<00:03:15.519> acts<00:03:15.790> like<00:03:15.910> gravity

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
converged skill which acts like gravity

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.420 
converged skill which acts like gravity
basically<00:03:16.660> pulling<00:03:17.379> other<00:03:17.560> enemies<00:03:18.010> closer

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
basically pulling other enemies closer

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.400 
basically pulling other enemies closer
to<00:03:18.819> your<00:03:18.940> face<00:03:19.180> locked<00:03:19.510> target<00:03:19.870> which<00:03:20.170> looks

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
to your face locked target which looks
