video I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.249 
video I'm going to show you how to do
the<00:00:04.980> infinite<00:00:05.640> gun<00:00:05.879> glitch<00:00:06.240> now<00:00:06.540> if<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:07.109> know

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
the infinite gun glitch now if you know

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.660 
the infinite gun glitch now if you know
if<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> glitch<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.309> you<00:00:08.400> know<00:00:08.550> what

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
if you see the glitch and you know what

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.980 
if you see the glitch and you know what
it<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.059> may<00:00:09.179> call<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.510> something<00:00:09.540> else<00:00:09.840> but

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it is you may call it something else but

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.379 
it is you may call it something else but
I<00:00:10.440> basically<00:00:11.280> just<00:00:11.550> called<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.910> infinite<00:00:12.240> gun

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I basically just called the infinite gun

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.959 
I basically just called the infinite gun
glitch<00:00:12.599> because<00:00:12.840> that's<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
glitch because that's what it is now the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.359 
glitch because that's what it is now the
reason<00:00:15.179> for<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.750> glitch<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.680> slow<00:00:17.160> down

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
reason for this glitch is to slow down

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.019 
reason for this glitch is to slow down
the<00:00:17.640> frame<00:00:17.850> rate<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> game<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> much<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the frame rate of the game so much that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
the frame rate of the game so much that
it's<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:21.869> advantage<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.830> do

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's to your advantage now you can do

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.470 
it's to your advantage now you can do
this<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.220> vs.<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> don't<00:00:24.029> recommend<00:00:24.269> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
this in vs. but I don't recommend it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
this in vs. but I don't recommend it
because<00:00:24.660> people<00:00:24.810> leave<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.250> they

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
because people leave or you know they

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.099 
because people leave or you know they
file<00:00:26.580> complaints<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.359> against<00:00:27.960> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
file complaints about you against you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
file complaints about you against you
but<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.650> campaign<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> great<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
but in campaign this is a great way to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.150 
but in campaign this is a great way to
get<00:00:30.510> through<00:00:30.720> expert<00:00:31.080> campaigns<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.859> find

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
get through expert campaigns if you find

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.900 
get through expert campaigns if you find
that<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.149> can't<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that you just can't do it so here is the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
that you just can't do it so here is the
glitch<00:00:36.090> alright<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.649> in<00:00:37.649> order<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
glitch alright so in order to do the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.780 
glitch alright so in order to do the
glitch<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> need<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.090> handguns<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.790> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

glitch you need two handguns and you
need<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> melee<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.559> think<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.399> easiest<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
need a melee now I think it's easiest to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.869 
need a melee now I think it's easiest to
go<00:00:45.390> into<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> corner<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.460> corner<00:00:47.700> right

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
go into a corner like this corner right

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.130 
go into a corner like this corner right
here<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.590> do<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> glitch<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:51.140> you'll

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here and do the glitch there now you'll

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.040 
here and do the glitch there now you'll
want<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.430> melee<00:00:53.850> away<00:00:54.329> from<00:00:54.719> where

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
want to get the melee away from where

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
want to get the melee away from where
the<00:00:55.199> handguns<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.829> because<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.910> try<00:00:57.300> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
now this blitz is actually pretty easy

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
now this blitz is actually pretty easy
to<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> may<00:01:34.200> take<00:01:34.409> some<00:01:34.530> practice<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to do but it may take some practice to

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
to do but it may take some practice to
get<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.570> basically<00:01:36.570> what<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> do

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
get it basically what you're going to do

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
get it basically what you're going to do
is<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.799> set<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.520> guns<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> pick<00:01:39.420> up

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
is just set the guns down and pick up

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
is just set the guns down and pick up
the<00:01:39.630> melee<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.350> switch<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.829> between

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the melee and just switch back between

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.249 
the melee and just switch back between
the<00:01:42.000> two<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> need<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.110> just

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the two and all you need to do is just

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
the two and all you need to do is just
keep<00:01:43.409> slamming<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> X<00:01:44.159> over<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.820> over<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
keep slamming on X over and over and you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
keep slamming on X over and over and you
can<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.740> creating<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> stack

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
can see that it's it's creating a stack

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.130 
can see that it's it's creating a stack
of<00:01:47.610> guns<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.540> doing<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.020> little

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
of guns because it's doing the little

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.620 
of guns because it's doing the little
gun<00:01:49.470> symbol<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.130> middle<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:51.149> means<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
gun symbol in the middle that means that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
gun symbol in the middle that means that
it's<00:01:51.780> creating<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.439> guns<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it's creating more guns and and all you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.389 
it's creating more guns and and all you
need<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.439> switch<00:01:55.770> between<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
need to do is kind of switch between the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.850 
need to do is kind of switch between the
two<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.939> over<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.200> over<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.560> over

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
two and over and over and over and over

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
two and over and over and over and over
and<00:01:58.979> over<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.880> makes<00:02:00.090> guns<00:02:00.509> for<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and over and as it makes guns for you it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
and over and as it makes guns for you it
only<00:02:01.590> gets<00:02:01.829> easier<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> have

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
only gets easier because then you have

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.730 
only gets easier because then you have
more<00:02:03.240> guns<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.960> pick<00:02:04.200> up<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
more guns that you can pick up from the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.980 
more guns that you can pick up from the
ground<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.479> keep<00:02:06.630> doing<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
ground and so you just keep doing this

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
ground and so you just keep doing this
over<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.439> over<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> over<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.340> you'll<00:02:08.610> know

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
over and over and over and you'll know

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.510 
over and over and over and you'll know
when<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> starts<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> lag<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:10.250> it'll<00:02:11.250> take

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
when it starts to lag because it'll take

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.640 
when it starts to lag because it'll take
your<00:02:11.880> guy<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> couple<00:02:12.510> times<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.110> reload<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
your guy a couple times to reload you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.980 
your guy a couple times to reload you
see<00:02:13.800> how<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.040> starting<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.660> reload<00:02:15.660> very

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
see how it's starting this reload very

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.500 
see how it's starting this reload very
slowly<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.250> melee<00:02:17.460> is<00:02:17.640> kind<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:17.970> freezing

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
slowly and the melee is kind of freezing

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.420 
slowly and the melee is kind of freezing
in<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.750> air<00:02:18.930> well<00:02:19.680> that's<00:02:19.890> when<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.280> know

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
in the air well that's when you know

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.920 
in the air well that's when you know
it's<00:02:20.640> starting<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.970> work<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.720> doesn't

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it's starting to work but it doesn't

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's starting to work but it doesn't
it's<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.970> working<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.840> do

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
it's it's really working when you do

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.170 
it's it's really working when you do
this<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> they<00:02:25.920> reload<00:02:26.340> about<00:02:26.670> three<00:02:26.940> or<00:02:27.030> four

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
this and they reload about three or four

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.410 
this and they reload about three or four
times<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.380> when<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.280> them<00:02:29.460> clicking

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
times so when you see them clicking

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.730 
times so when you see them clicking
they're<00:02:30.690> gone<00:02:30.930> about<00:02:31.170> three<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:31.530> four<00:02:31.710> times

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
they're gone about three or four times

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.070 
they're gone about three or four times
over<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.490> over<00:02:32.640> that's<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.870> it's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
over and over that's when you know it's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:45.740 
over and over that's when you know it's
working<00:02:42.860> okay<00:02:43.860> it's<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.180> melee<00:02:45.480> just

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
working okay it's and the melee just

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.290 
working okay it's and the melee just
froze<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.560> air<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:47.940> another

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
froze in the air so that's another

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.090 
froze in the air so that's another
that's<00:02:48.660> another<00:02:48.900> good<00:02:49.290> indicator<00:02:49.350> okay<00:02:50.040> see

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that's another good indicator okay see

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.640 
that's another good indicator okay see
how<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:51.090> melee<00:02:51.510> froze<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.170> air<00:02:52.320> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
how this this melee froze in the air and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.460 
how this this melee froze in the air and
these<00:02:53.310> handguns<00:02:54.000> are<00:02:54.180> pretty<00:02:54.420> much<00:02:54.600> stacked

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
these handguns are pretty much stacked

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.960 
these handguns are pretty much stacked
in<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.770> row<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.490> when<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.820> know<00:02:56.940> it's

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
in a row that's when you know it's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
in a row that's when you know it's
working<00:02:57.300> because<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.840> framerate<00:02:58.080> is<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.590> slow

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
working because the framerate is so slow

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.150 
working because the framerate is so slow
that<00:02:58.950> these<00:02:59.310> guns<00:02:59.580> froze<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.480> air<00:03:00.600> now<00:03:01.380> we

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that these guns froze in the air now we

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.030 
that these guns froze in the air now we
can<00:03:02.310> also<00:03:02.490> check<00:03:02.850> by<00:03:03.120> shooting<00:03:03.570> if<00:03:04.050> we<00:03:04.770> shoot

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
can also check by shooting if we shoot

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.120 
can also check by shooting if we shoot
and<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.810> numbers<00:03:07.140> are<00:03:07.290> messed<00:03:07.410> up<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.980> it's

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and the numbers are messed up then it's

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.640 
and the numbers are messed up then it's
working<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> want<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.780> mess<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.200> up<00:03:10.290> just<00:03:10.470> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
working but I want to mess it up just a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910 
working but I want to mess it up just a
little<00:03:10.890> bit<00:03:11.040> more<00:03:12.020> just<00:03:13.020> just<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.530> make<00:03:13.710> sure

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
little bit more just just to make sure

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.220 
little bit more just just to make sure
that<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> glitch<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.050> see

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
that the glitch is on and you can see

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
that the glitch is on and you can see
this<00:03:19.350> taking<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.920> little<00:03:20.160> while<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> heck<00:03:20.730> it's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
this taking a little while a heck it's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.520 
this taking a little while a heck it's
not<00:03:21.060> even<00:03:21.240> showing<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> melee<00:03:21.959> half<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.320> time

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
not even showing the melee half the time

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.699 
not even showing the melee half the time
so<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.250> good<00:03:23.400> time

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.050 

all<00:03:30.709> right<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:31.130> should<00:03:31.310> be<00:03:31.370> pretty<00:03:31.640> good

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
all right that should be pretty good

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.420 
all right that should be pretty good
now<00:03:32.270> you<00:03:32.330> can<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.050> this<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.680> stack<00:03:34.160> is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
now you can see that this like stack is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.010 
now you can see that this like stack is
huge<00:03:34.790> kind<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.120> looks<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.420> question<00:03:35.870> mark

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
huge kind of looks like a question mark

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.530 
huge kind of looks like a question mark
it's<00:03:36.560> really<00:03:36.860> cool<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:38.060> that's<00:03:38.239> what<00:03:38.450> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
it's really cool and that's what the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.990 
it's really cool and that's what the
glitcher<00:03:38.870> does<00:03:39.020> so<00:03:39.319> now<00:03:39.830> I'm<00:03:40.220> going<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.730> show

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
glitcher does so now I'm going to show

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.570 
glitcher does so now I'm going to show
you<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.720> huge<00:03:42.170> benefit<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:43.069> doing<00:03:43.310> this

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
you the huge benefit of doing this

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.360 
you the huge benefit of doing this
glitch<00:03:43.819> now<00:03:44.630> that<00:03:44.810> it's<00:03:44.989> lagging<00:03:45.410> so<00:03:45.680> bad<00:03:45.709> you

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
glitch now that it's lagging so bad you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.870 
glitch now that it's lagging so bad you
can<00:03:46.580> walk<00:03:46.790> around<00:03:47.000> every<00:03:47.630> zombie<00:03:48.019> you<00:03:48.140> come<00:03:48.410> to

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
can walk around every zombie you come to

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.759 
can walk around every zombie you come to
and<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.060> don't<00:03:50.239> have<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.690> fight<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> single<00:03:51.620> one

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
and you don't have to fight a single one

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.370 
and you don't have to fight a single one
and<00:03:54.769> like<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.760> said<00:03:55.819> this<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.360> great<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:56.870> expert

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
and like I said this is great for expert

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.309 
and like I said this is great for expert
because<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:59.450> know<00:03:59.569> if<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.840> find<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.200> you

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
because you know if you find that you

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.140 
because you know if you find that you
keep<00:04:00.500> getting<00:04:00.769> swamped<00:04:01.190> by<00:04:01.280> zombies<00:04:01.790> then

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
keep getting swamped by zombies then

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.090 
keep getting swamped by zombies then
this<00:04:02.810> won't<00:04:03.110> be<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> problem<00:04:03.620> for<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:03.890> because

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
this won't be a problem for you because

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.240 
this won't be a problem for you because
once<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.090> get<00:04:05.360> past<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.810> certain<00:04:05.840> part<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.650> you

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
once you get past a certain part and you

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.680 
once you get past a certain part and you
don't<00:04:07.489> kill<00:04:07.760> any<00:04:08.030> zombies

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
don't kill any zombies

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.500 
don't kill any zombies
no<00:04:08.989> more<00:04:09.290> will<00:04:09.560> spawn<00:04:10.040> simply<00:04:11.030> because<00:04:11.330> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
no more will spawn simply because the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.630 
no more will spawn simply because the
game<00:04:11.690> only<00:04:11.930> creates<00:04:12.410> so<00:04:12.739> many<00:04:13.010> zombies<00:04:13.250> at<00:04:13.610> a

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
game only creates so many zombies at a

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.030 
game only creates so many zombies at a
time<00:04:13.940> because<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.840> game<00:04:15.200> can<00:04:15.410> only<00:04:15.530> handle<00:04:15.980> so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
time because the game can only handle so

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.810 
time because the game can only handle so
many<00:04:16.370> zombies<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.829> simply<00:04:18.829> bypass<00:04:19.519> all

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
many zombies so if you simply bypass all

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.659 
many zombies so if you simply bypass all
of<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.299> zombies<00:04:20.780> before<00:04:21.410> on<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.130> top<00:04:22.340> levels

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
of the zombies before on the top levels

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.850 
of the zombies before on the top levels
without<00:04:22.970> killing<00:04:23.360> them<00:04:23.479> look<00:04:24.200> there's<00:04:24.560> one

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
without killing them look there's one

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.240 
without killing them look there's one
zombie<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.729> can't<00:04:25.970> even<00:04:26.180> catch<00:04:26.360> me<00:04:26.570> and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
zombie and you can't even catch me and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.640 
zombie and you can't even catch me and
now<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.400> went<00:04:28.850> into<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.479> elevator<00:04:29.900> now<00:04:30.530> if

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
now I just went into the elevator now if

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.810 
now I just went into the elevator now if
I<00:04:30.770> really<00:04:31.010> wanted<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> get<00:04:31.520> through<00:04:31.700> this

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
I really wanted to get through this

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.279 
I really wanted to get through this
campaign<00:04:32.150> really<00:04:32.300> fast<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.870> could<00:04:33.020> have<00:04:33.110> killed

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
campaign really fast I could have killed

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.590 
campaign really fast I could have killed
my<00:04:33.500> own<00:04:33.620> guys<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.250> then<00:04:34.789> did<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.030> but<00:04:35.330> that's

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
my own guys and then did it but that's

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.150 
my own guys and then did it but that's
basically<00:04:35.810> how<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.229> do<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.620> infinite<00:04:36.979> gun

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
basically how to do the infinite gun

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.110 
basically how to do the infinite gun
glitch<00:04:37.700> guys<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.289> said<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.710> do<00:04:39.919> need<00:04:40.160> to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
glitch guys like I said you do need to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.469 
glitch guys like I said you do need to
two<00:04:41.900> guns<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.590> melee<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:43.430> it<00:04:43.789> may<00:04:44.000> be<00:04:44.060> easier

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
two guns and a melee so it may be easier

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.540 
two guns and a melee so it may be easier
to<00:04:44.690> play<00:04:45.380> with<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.590> friend<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.160> have<00:04:46.310> them

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
to play with a friend and have them

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.310 
to play with a friend and have them
carry<00:04:46.910> either<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.360> melee<00:04:47.720> or<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.140> two

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
carry either the melee or the two

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.490 
carry either the melee or the two
handguns<00:04:48.650> so<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.550> when<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.880> see<00:04:50.120> another

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
handguns so that when you see another

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.590 
handguns so that when you see another
another<00:04:51.500> melee<00:04:52.039> then<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.150> do<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.390> glitch

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
another melee then you can do the glitch

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.810 
another melee then you can do the glitch
there<00:04:53.930> or<00:04:54.229> another<00:04:54.770> stack<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.250> handguns<00:04:55.610> to

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
there or another stack of handguns to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.340 
there or another stack of handguns to
your<00:04:55.970> person<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.539> put<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.810> melee<00:04:57.110> down

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
your person can put the melee down

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.070 
your person can put the melee down
either<00:04:58.130> way<00:04:58.490> will<00:04:59.479> work<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.960> that's

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
either way will work and that's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.480 
either way will work and that's
basically<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.590> that's<00:05:00.830> how<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.460> the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
basically it that's how you do the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.210 
basically it that's how you do the
infinite<00:05:02.180> gun<00:05:02.389> glitch<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.530> is<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.979> use

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
infinite gun glitch and that is the use

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.270 
infinite gun glitch and that is the use
of<00:05:04.490> it<00:05:04.639> and<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:05.990> can<00:05:06.169> kind<00:05:06.350> of<00:05:06.440> see<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.830> it's

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
of it and you can kind of see that it's

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.879 
of it and you can kind of see that it's
lagging<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.030> bad<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:09.080> again<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.710> can

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
lagging so bad that you again you can

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.129 
lagging so bad that you again you can
walk<00:05:10.070> across<00:05:10.250> any<00:05:10.789> zombie<00:05:11.180> now<00:05:11.870> I'm<00:05:11.960> going<00:05:12.080> to

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
walk across any zombie now I'm going to

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.360 
walk across any zombie now I'm going to
show<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.289> my<00:05:12.470> favorite<00:05:12.800> voice<00:05:12.919> real<00:05:13.190> quick

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
show you my favorite voice real quick

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.840 
show you my favorite voice real quick
this<00:05:13.520> really<00:05:13.789> has<00:05:13.880> nothing<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.300> do<00:05:14.539> with

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
this really has nothing to do with

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.640 
this really has nothing to do with
hasn't<00:05:16.850> nothing<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.180> do<00:05:17.330> with<00:05:17.479> that

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.230 

but<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.740> looks<00:05:22.950> like<00:05:24.080> it's<00:05:25.080> right<00:05:25.290> over<00:05:25.560> here

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
but it looks like it's right over here

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.670 
but it looks like it's right over here
so<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.360> is<00:05:27.510> actually<00:05:27.900> at<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.050> beginning<00:05:28.500> of

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
so this is actually at the beginning of

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.180 
so this is actually at the beginning of
the<00:05:28.889> level<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:30.050> if<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.230> fail<00:05:31.500> at<00:05:31.680> this<00:05:31.889> then

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
the level and if I fail at this then

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.590 
the level and if I fail at this then
you'll<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.639> something<00:05:32.850> to<00:05:33.000> laugh<00:05:33.210> about

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
you'll have something to laugh about

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.800 
you'll have something to laugh about
but<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.530> should<00:05:34.830> work<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.480> basically<00:05:36.480> what<00:05:36.720> you

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
but it should work so basically what you

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.930 
but it should work so basically what you
do<00:05:36.990> is<00:05:37.020> you<00:05:37.350> go<00:05:37.500> over<00:05:37.530> here<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.280> first<00:05:38.580> room

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
do is you go over here the first room

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.690 
do is you go over here the first room
you<00:05:39.180> go<00:05:39.990> left<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.560> then<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:41.040> or<00:05:41.280> you<00:05:41.400> go<00:05:41.520> right

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
you go left and then you or you go right

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.159 
you go left and then you or you go right
in<00:05:41.850> the<00:05:41.940> left<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.480> can<00:05:42.510> fall<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.080> the

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
in the left and you can fall to the

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.780 
in the left and you can fall to the
second<00:05:43.560> level<00:05:43.710> now<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.040> may<00:05:44.280> have<00:05:44.370> seen<00:05:44.430> this
