00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.870 

and<00:04:00.939> we<00:04:01.659> can<00:04:01.780> always<00:04:02.049> use<00:04:02.079> some<00:04:02.439> flares

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.409 

oh<00:04:15.849> yeah<00:04:16.660> I<00:04:17.639> hated<00:04:18.639> running<00:04:18.970> through<00:04:19.269> this

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
oh yeah I hated running through this

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.759 
oh yeah I hated running through this
area<00:04:19.660> completely<00:04:20.320> blind

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.420 

that<00:04:30.790> looks<00:04:31.000> like<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> treasure<00:04:31.419> chest<00:04:32.430> will

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
that looks like a treasure chest will

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.159 
that looks like a treasure chest will
probably<00:04:33.760> be<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.910> map<00:04:34.210> or<00:04:34.389> something<00:04:34.570> stupid

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
probably be a map or something stupid

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.129 
probably be a map or something stupid
like<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:36.389> but<00:04:37.389> that<00:04:37.419> was<00:04:37.600> there<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.020> entire

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
like that but that was there the entire

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.000 
like that but that was there the entire
time

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
time

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.939 
time
