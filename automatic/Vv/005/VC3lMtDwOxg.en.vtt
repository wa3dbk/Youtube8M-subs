let's<00:02:12.629> go<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> next<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.200> here

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
let's go to the next one here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
let's go to the next one here
which<00:02:14.370> party<00:02:14.970> benefits<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.540> most<00:02:15.569> from<00:02:15.870> money

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
which party benefits the most from money

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.670 
which party benefits the most from money
in<00:02:16.319> politics<00:02:17.450> Democrats<00:02:18.769> 14%<00:02:20.150> Republicans

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
in politics Democrats 14% Republicans

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.680 
in politics Democrats 14% Republicans
23%<00:02:22.680> both<00:02:23.550> equally<00:02:24.590> fifty-eight<00:02:25.590> percent<00:02:26.690> yes

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
23% both equally fifty-eight percent yes

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.089 
23% both equally fifty-eight percent yes
again<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.540> spot<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.800> where<00:02:31.800> more

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
again this is I think spot on where more

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.380 
again this is I think spot on where more
people<00:02:32.130> are<00:02:32.519> pointing<00:02:32.670> out<00:02:32.940> yeah<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
people are pointing out yeah the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.030 
people are pointing out yeah the
Republicans<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.050> kind<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.349> bigger<00:02:34.560> sellouts

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
Republicans are kind of bigger sellouts

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.890 
Republicans are kind of bigger sellouts
so<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.940> why<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.269> have<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> higher<00:02:36.660> number

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
so that's why they have a higher number

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.830 
so that's why they have a higher number
i<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.500> lot<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> people<00:02:37.739> recognize<00:02:38.400> that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
i think a lot of people recognize that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.270 
i think a lot of people recognize that
but<00:02:39.840> fifty-eight<00:02:40.319> percent<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.830> both<00:02:40.980> equally

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
but fifty-eight percent for both equally

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.720 
but fifty-eight percent for both equally
that's<00:02:41.580> true<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.720> just<00:02:42.870> so<00:02:43.019> happens<00:02:43.410> that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
that's true and it just so happens that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.430 
that's true and it just so happens that
the<00:02:44.730> democrats<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.269> republicans<00:02:45.360> they<00:02:46.230> used

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
the democrats and republicans they used

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.190 
the democrats and republicans they used
to<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.709> bought<00:02:46.950> off<00:02:47.160> by<00:02:47.660> different<00:02:48.660> sets<00:02:49.049> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
to be bought off by different sets of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
to be bought off by different sets of
special<00:02:49.620> interests<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.430> republicans<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
special interests so republicans it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.550 
special interests so republicans it
would<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.330> all<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.720> know<00:02:51.840> Wall<00:02:52.140> Street<00:02:52.440> the

worst of the worst people the Democrats

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.160 
worst of the worst people the Democrats

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
in the past so what I think makes sense

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.120 
in the past so what I think makes sense
and<00:03:48.540> my<00:03:48.660> buddies<00:03:48.959> over<00:03:48.989> at<00:03:49.230> ey<00:03:49.530> t<00:03:49.590> think<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
and my buddies over at ey t think it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.250 
and my buddies over at ey t think it
makes<00:03:50.280> sense<00:03:50.430> as<00:03:50.670> well<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.780> try<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.019> get<00:03:52.200> a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
makes sense as well is to try to get a

percent of the time if they ever do
something<00:04:50.070> we<00:04:50.280> like<00:04:50.460> it's<00:04:50.730> by<00:04:50.880> accident

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
something we like it's by accident

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.180 
something we like it's by accident
because<00:04:51.570> some<00:04:51.840> other<00:04:52.020> corporation<00:04:52.620> that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
because some other corporation that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.620 
because some other corporation that
actually<00:04:53.520> has<00:04:53.670> influenced<00:04:54.150> pushed<00:04:54.450> in<00:04:54.600> that

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
actually has influenced pushed in that

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.690 
actually has influenced pushed in that
direction<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:57.420> solution<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:59.160> get<00:04:59.400> rid

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
direction so the solution is you get rid

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.909 
direction so the solution is you get rid
of<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.840> money<00:05:01.080> which<00:05:01.290> is<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.560> root<00:05:01.710> of<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
of the money which is the root of the

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.120 
of the money which is the root of the
problem<00:05:02.280> in<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.460> system<00:05:02.820> if<00:05:03.000> we<00:05:03.180> have<00:05:03.450> a

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
problem in the system if we have a

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.490 
problem in the system if we have a
democracy<00:05:05.130> that's<00:05:05.400> actually<00:05:05.820> based<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.500> ideas

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
democracy that's actually based on ideas

democracy that's actually based on ideas
and<00:05:08.030> competing<00:05:09.030> philosophies<00:05:09.440> then<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.590> have

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
and competing philosophies then you have

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.260
