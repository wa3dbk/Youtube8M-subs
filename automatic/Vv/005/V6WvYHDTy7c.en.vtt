I'd play it again and again yeah well
it's<00:06:30.760> a<00:06:30.850> lot<00:06:30.970> of<00:06:31.030> energy<00:06:31.630> and<00:06:31.900> it's<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.740> it's<00:06:32.979> a

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
it's a lot of energy and it's a it's a

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.280 
it's a lot of energy and it's a it's a
clever<00:06:33.400> way<00:06:33.760> of<00:06:33.790> using<00:06:34.919> tablets<00:06:35.919> and<00:06:36.190> phones

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:37.290 
clever way of using tablets and phones

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.230 
clever way of using tablets and phones
to<00:06:38.290> instead<00:06:38.680> of<00:06:38.830> just<00:06:38.979> having<00:06:39.190> like<00:06:39.850> you<00:06:40.120> know

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
to instead of just having like you know

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.540 
to instead of just having like you know
flappy<00:06:40.750> bird<00:06:41.020> which<00:06:41.410> to<00:06:41.800> me<00:06:41.919> I<00:06:41.950> think<00:06:42.310> it's<00:06:42.430> one

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
flappy bird which to me I think it's one

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.370 
flappy bird which to me I think it's one
of<00:06:42.639> the<00:06:42.700> worst<00:06:42.850> games<00:06:43.210> I've<00:06:43.450> ever<00:06:43.540> played<00:06:43.690> it's

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
of the worst games I've ever played it's

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.610 
of the worst games I've ever played it's
just<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.770> tap<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:46.240> a<00:06:46.570> sequence<00:06:47.080> and<00:06:47.320> you're<00:06:47.500> just

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
just a tap to a sequence and you're just

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.800 
just a tap to a sequence and you're just
playing<00:06:47.860> by<00:06:48.010> yourself<00:06:48.160> to<00:06:49.120> get<00:06:49.240> a<00:06:49.270> high<00:06:49.479> point

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
playing by yourself to get a high point

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.810 
playing by yourself to get a high point
where<00:06:50.650> this<00:06:50.740> is<00:06:50.919> actually<00:06:51.100> playing<00:06:51.580> with
