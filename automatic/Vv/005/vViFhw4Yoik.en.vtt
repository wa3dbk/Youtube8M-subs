one cuz right now right now at the
moment<00:02:45.379> I'll<00:02:45.709> have<00:02:45.950> two<00:02:46.250> connected<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.970> for

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
moment I'll have two connected and for

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.930 
moment I'll have two connected and for
some<00:02:47.390> reason<00:02:47.690> one<00:02:47.989> only<00:02:48.290> gets<00:02:48.560> picked<00:02:48.829> up<00:02:49.069> so

some reason one only gets picked up so
maybe<00:02:50.329> it's<00:02:50.540> some<00:02:50.690> kind<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.959> support<00:02:51.079> problem

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
maybe it's some kind of support problem

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.369 
maybe it's some kind of support problem
with<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.920> fan<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:53.329> anyways<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:53.690> yeah<00:02:54.170> that's

something is wrong with the connector
that<00:03:17.750> they<00:03:17.930> gave<00:03:18.170> me<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.709> doesn't<00:03:19.069> work<00:03:19.220> on<00:03:19.519> my

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that they gave me it doesn't work on my

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.750 
that they gave me it doesn't work on my
motherboard<00:03:20.319> IDE<00:03:21.319> connects<00:03:21.709> fine<00:03:22.130> but<00:03:22.519> just

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
motherboard IDE connects fine but just

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.680 
motherboard IDE connects fine but just
doesn't<00:03:22.940> pop<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.480> place<00:03:23.720> correctly<00:03:24.290> so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
doesn't pop in place correctly so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.629 
doesn't pop in place correctly so
whatever<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:26.989> 2.0<00:03:27.560> USB<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.130> can<00:03:28.459> deal<00:03:28.609> with

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
whatever it's 2.0 USB I can deal with

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.110 
whatever it's 2.0 USB I can deal with
that<00:03:29.440> microphone<00:03:30.440> jack<00:03:30.950> headphone<00:03:31.459> jack<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
that microphone jack headphone jack and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.180 
that microphone jack headphone jack and
then<00:03:32.690> firewire<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:35.329> button<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.470> lights

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
then firewire the button for the lights

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.110 
then firewire the button for the lights
on<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:39.230> front<00:03:39.620> because<00:03:40.250> these<00:03:40.430> can<00:03:40.730> turn<00:03:40.940> on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
on the front because these can turn on

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.970

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
computer will reset and then I have a

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.270 
computer will reset and then I have a
little<00:04:02.239> bay<00:04:02.389> here<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.709> can<00:04:03.889> just<00:04:04.069> set

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
little bay here that you can just set

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.830 
little bay here that you can just set
things<00:04:04.489> in<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.760> have<00:04:04.970> my<00:04:05.060> crappy<00:04:05.419> phone<00:04:05.599> for

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
great pops out I am not sure how well

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.339 
great pops out I am not sure how well
you<00:04:11.120> guys<00:04:11.329> can<00:04:11.540> see<00:04:11.780> this<00:04:11.959> because<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
you guys can see this because the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.309 
you guys can see this because the
lighting<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:12.739> really<00:04:12.919> bad<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.340> my<00:04:13.430> room<00:04:13.639> but

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
lighting is really bad in my room but

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.529 
lighting is really bad in my room but
this<00:04:15.319> little<00:04:15.590> great<00:04:15.799> pops<00:04:16.070> off<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.609> you've

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
this little great pops off and you've

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.650 
this little great pops off and you've
got<00:04:17.690> your<00:04:17.840> access<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.769> your<00:04:18.940> intake<00:04:19.940> fans<00:04:20.269> for

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
got your access to your intake fans for

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.200 
got your access to your intake fans for
the<00:04:20.750> top<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.289> then<00:04:21.949> also<00:04:22.220> what<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:23.000> do

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
the top and then also what you can do

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.720 
the top and then also what you can do
you<00:04:23.449> can<00:04:23.630> have<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.289> think<00:04:24.349> it's

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
you can have I think it's

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.890 
you can have I think it's
140<00:04:26.730> millimeter<00:04:27.180> fans<00:04:27.660> intake<00:04:28.410> or<00:04:29.540> not<00:04:30.540> can't

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
140 millimeter fans intake or not can't

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.820 
140 millimeter fans intake or not can't
be<00:04:30.990> too<00:04:31.139> Conor<00:04:31.350> no<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:31.860> 140<00:04:32.870> intake<00:04:33.870> fans<00:04:34.290> and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
be too Conor no so 140 intake fans and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.810 
be too Conor no so 140 intake fans and
or<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:36.510> can<00:04:36.780> have<00:04:37.310> 120<00:04:38.310> millimeter<00:04:38.930> for

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
or you can have 120 millimeter for

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.300 
or you can have 120 millimeter for
liquid<00:04:41.820> cooling<00:04:42.449> CPU<00:04:43.139> so<00:04:43.770> basically<00:04:44.100> the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
liquid cooling CPU so basically the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.520 
liquid cooling CPU so basically the
radiator<00:04:44.729> well<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.630> fans<00:04:45.840> sit<00:04:46.290> right<00:04:46.470> here

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
radiator well the fans sit right here

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.090 
radiator well the fans sit right here
right<00:04:47.190> below<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.760> little<00:04:48.030> sheet<00:04:48.690> metal<00:04:49.260> part

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
right below this little sheet metal part

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.030 
right below this little sheet metal part
of<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.310> case<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.870> radiator<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.710> can't

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
of the case is the radiator you can't

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.980 
of the case is the radiator you can't
see<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.610> because<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.030> fans<00:04:54.300> are<00:04:54.479> spinning<00:04:54.870> but

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
see it because the fans are spinning but

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990 
see it because the fans are spinning but
I<00:04:55.050> can<00:04:55.380> see<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:56.190> I'm<00:04:56.460> kind<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.699> bummed<00:04:56.820> out

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
I can see it so I'm kind of bummed out

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.719 
I can see it so I'm kind of bummed out
you<00:04:57.060> can't<00:04:57.330> see<00:04:57.449> about<00:04:57.690> see<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:59.070> um<00:04:59.280> yeah

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
you can't see about see it but um yeah

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.390 
you can't see about see it but um yeah
so<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.000> radiator<00:05:00.360> sits<00:05:00.720> inside<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.410> cools

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
so the radiator sits inside and cools

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.850 
so the radiator sits inside and cools
the<00:05:02.550> CPU<00:05:03.030> all<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.389> cords<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:03.960> tubing<00:05:04.560> are

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
the CPU all the cords and tubing are

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.950 
the CPU all the cords and tubing are
inside<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.639> it<00:05:05.760> kept<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.210> kept<00:05:06.600> really

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
inside so it kept it's kept really

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.240 
inside so it kept it's kept really
really<00:05:07.530> nice<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.770> organized<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.979> let's<00:05:10.979> put

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
really nice and organized so let's put

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.800 
really nice and organized so let's put
that<00:05:11.280> back<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:14.190> can't<00:05:14.880> unfortunately<00:05:15.270> show

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
that back and I can't unfortunately show

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.300 
that back and I can't unfortunately show
you<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.050> inside<00:05:16.410> because<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.010> would<00:05:17.160> have<00:05:17.250> to

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
you the inside because I would have to

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.570 
you the inside because I would have to
UM<00:05:17.550> connect<00:05:17.940> everything<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:19.080> it's<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.950> pain<00:05:20.340> to

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
UM connect everything and it's a pain to

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.129 
UM connect everything and it's a pain to
get<00:05:20.700> everything<00:05:20.940> connected<00:05:21.270> because<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.840> had

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
get everything connected because I had

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.200 
get everything connected because I had
to<00:05:22.200> move<00:05:22.320> my<00:05:22.380> PC<00:05:22.830> my<00:05:22.979> PC<00:05:23.160> used<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.490> sit<00:05:23.789> right

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
to move my PC my PC used to sit right

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
to move my PC my PC used to sit right
over<00:05:25.370> there<00:05:26.370> like<00:05:26.880> right<00:05:27.389> over<00:05:27.419> there<00:05:27.810> so<00:05:28.590> but

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
over there like right over there so but

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.440 
over there like right over there so but
I<00:05:29.340> had<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.580> move<00:05:29.700> it<00:05:29.850> all<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.000> way<00:05:30.180> over<00:05:30.330> here

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
I had to move it all the way over here

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.890 
I had to move it all the way over here
because<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.410> case<00:05:31.680> is<00:05:31.950> so<00:05:32.190> freaking<00:05:32.789> big<00:05:33.030> so

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
because the case is so freaking big so

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.490 
because the case is so freaking big so
the<00:05:34.020> case<00:05:34.400> sticks<00:05:35.400> out<00:05:35.780> quite<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.810> lot<00:05:37.139> it

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
anyways so normal CPU temperature and

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.960 
anyways so normal CPU temperature and

Celsius degrees
I<00:06:03.030> don't<00:06:03.599> know<00:06:03.690> in<00:06:03.810> Fahrenheit<00:06:04.200> because<00:06:04.470> I

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
I don't know in Fahrenheit because I

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.120 
I don't know in Fahrenheit because I
don't<00:06:04.740> use<00:06:04.860> Fahrenheit<00:06:05.340> anymore<00:06:05.880> for<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.270> CPU

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
don't use Fahrenheit anymore for the CPU

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.920 
don't use Fahrenheit anymore for the CPU
normally<00:06:08.130> on<00:06:08.250> I'll<00:06:08.520> get<00:06:08.910> about<00:06:09.030> 23<00:06:09.599> degrees

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
normally on I'll get about 23 degrees

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.770 
normally on I'll get about 23 degrees
Celsius<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:11.280> an<00:06:12.000> heavy<00:06:12.539> load<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:13.229> get<00:06:13.530> about<00:06:14.780> 37

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
Celsius and an heavy load I get about 37

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.750 
Celsius and an heavy load I get about 37
degrees<00:06:16.050> Celsius<00:06:16.680> which<00:06:16.979> is<00:06:17.190> not<00:06:17.490> that<00:06:17.700> bad

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
degrees Celsius which is not that bad

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.940 
degrees Celsius which is not that bad
that<00:06:18.510> is<00:06:18.750> fantastic

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
the coarse air carbide 500 hour series

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.790 
the coarse air carbide 500 hour series
which<00:06:37.680> is

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
which is

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.309

graphics card in the future and another

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.490 
graphics card in the future and another
CPU<00:06:57.340> of<00:06:57.789> course<00:06:58.090> because<00:06:58.389> battlefield<00:06:59.169> 4

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
CPU of course because battlefield 4

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.649 
CPU of course because battlefield 4
can't<00:07:00.340> handle<00:07:01.000> my<00:07:01.539> CPU<00:07:02.050> for<00:07:02.949> recording<00:07:03.659> so

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:04.659 
can't handle my CPU for recording so

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.409 
can't handle my CPU for recording so
yeah<00:07:04.840> anyways<00:07:05.590> I'm<00:07:06.430> gonna<00:07:06.550> stay<00:07:06.879> I<00:07:06.909> will<00:07:07.180> talk
