00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's a little bit smaller this most this
one's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.079> square<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.009> one's<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.400> rectangle

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
one's a square this one's a rectangle

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
one's a square this one's a rectangle
but<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.329> basically<00:01:33.810> serve<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> same

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but they basically serve the same

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
but they basically serve the same
purpose<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.220> open<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.579> door<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
purpose it's going to open a door like a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
purpose it's going to open a door like a
regular<00:01:36.900> button<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> know

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
regular button and I was going to know

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
regular button and I was going to know
it's<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.880> no<00:01:39.479> one's<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's there no one's going to see it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
it's there no one's going to see it
unless<00:01:40.619> they're<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.130> off<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> side

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
unless they're just like off to the side

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
unless they're just like off to the side
they<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.840> pixel<00:01:43.350> sticking

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
they see it's one little pixel sticking

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.260 
they see it's one little pixel sticking
out<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> wall<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.610> they're<00:01:45.000> they're<00:01:45.240> not

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
out of the wall but they're they're not

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420 
out of the wall but they're they're not
gonna<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.229> exactly<00:01:46.979> like<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
gonna see it so it's exactly like in the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.039 
gonna see it so it's exactly like in the
movies<00:01:47.700> where<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.149> people<00:01:48.180> open<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
movies where you see people open up a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.899 
movies where you see people open up a
book<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.470> push<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> book<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.369> opens<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.790> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
book or push in a book and it opens up a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.160 
book or push in a book and it opens up a
secret<00:01:51.210> little<00:01:51.450> room<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.020> definitely

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
secret little room you can definitely

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.569 
secret little room you can definitely
set<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.619> something<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.130> cool<00:01:53.369> with

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
set up something really cool with

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.700 
set up something really cool with
pistons<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> yeah<00:01:54.720> over<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pistons and yeah over here we have the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
pistons and yeah over here we have the
hinged<00:01:56.040> painting<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.670> he<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
hinged painting as he has to see on the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
hinged painting as he has to see on the
top<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.409> basically<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.009> wall<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
top and this is basically just a wall of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
top and this is basically just a wall of
paintings<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> can't<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.509> where<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
paintings you can't really see where the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
paintings you can't really see where the
hinged<00:02:01.320> paintings<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.860> unless<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.250> hover<00:02:02.490> over

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
hinged paintings are unless I hover over

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.310 
hinged paintings are unless I hover over
it<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.600> basically<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.200> does

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it but this is basically what it does

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
it but this is basically what it does
it's<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.159> hinged<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.939> open

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's just it's just hinged you can open

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.809 
it's just it's just hinged you can open
and<00:02:06.420> close<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> door<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.680> no<00:02:08.640> one's

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and close it like a door and no one's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
and close it like a door and no one's
going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.000> suspect<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.959> blends<00:02:10.200> in

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
going to suspect it's there it blends in

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.930 
going to suspect it's there it blends in
with<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> other<00:02:10.770> paintings<00:02:11.220> quite<00:02:11.520> nicely<00:02:11.760> so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
with the other paintings quite nicely so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.800 
with the other paintings quite nicely so
no<00:02:12.270> one's<00:02:12.450> really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
no one's really

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.660 
no one's really
no<00:02:13.140> that's<00:02:13.410> actually<00:02:13.680> there<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.400> go

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
no that's actually there you can just go

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.850 
no that's actually there you can just go
right<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.810> shift<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.410> no<00:02:16.650> one's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
right there and then shift and no one's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.260 
right there and then shift and no one's
going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.099> know<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.910> went<00:02:18.209> through

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
going to know that you just went through

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.820 
going to know that you just went through
that<00:02:18.420> door<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.200> yeah<00:02:19.319> these<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.680> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that door so yeah these are all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.530 
that door so yeah these are all
different<00:02:20.040> ways<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.520> hide<00:02:20.700> your<00:02:20.940> super<00:02:21.330> secret

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
different ways to hide your super secret

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
different ways to hide your super secret
stuff<00:02:21.900> from<00:02:22.050> other<00:02:22.200> people<00:02:22.500> without<00:02:22.739> them

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
stuff from other people without them

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.339 
stuff from other people without them
really<00:02:23.160> knowing<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.810> over<00:02:24.810> here<00:02:24.989> we<00:02:25.170> have

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
really knowing and over here we have

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.260 
really knowing and over here we have
different<00:02:25.530> spikes<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.459> here<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.880> spike

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
different spikes so here we have a spike

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.970 
different spikes so here we have a spike
trap<00:02:27.569> which<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> powered<00:02:28.140> by<00:02:28.200> redstone<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:28.860> it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
trap which is powered by redstone if it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.170 
trap which is powered by redstone if it
doesn't<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.310> any<00:02:29.489> power<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.849> going<00:02:29.970> look

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
doesn't have any power it's going look

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
doesn't have any power it's going look
just<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.599> this<00:02:30.900> but<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> redstone

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
just like this but I have a redstone

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.740 
just like this but I have a redstone
block<00:02:32.640> underneath<00:02:32.970> all<00:02:33.239> these<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.630> could

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
block underneath all these so I could

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.910 
block underneath all these so I could
show<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.930> guys<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.410> look<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
show you guys what they look like and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.740 
show you guys what they look like and
this<00:02:35.370> basically<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.060> whenever<00:02:36.450> you're<00:02:36.599> on

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
this basically just whenever you're on

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.930 
this basically just whenever you're on
top<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.440> gives<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.950> damage<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:38.730> if

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
top of it it gives you damage so if

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.150 
top of it it gives you damage so if
you're<00:02:39.150> gonna<00:02:39.360> want<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.720> avoid<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
you're gonna want to avoid that and this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.620 
you're gonna want to avoid that and this
is<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> same<00:02:41.610> thing<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> poison<00:02:42.390> spike

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
is the same thing it's a poison spike

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.570 
is the same thing it's a poison spike
trap<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.230> guys<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.560> obviously<00:02:43.950> figure<00:02:44.430> out

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
trap you guys can obviously figure out

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.920 
trap you guys can obviously figure out
that<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.850> gives<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.299> poisoning<00:02:45.840> effect

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that this gives you poisoning effect

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
that this gives you poisoning effect
whenever<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.560> land<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:46.980> same<00:02:47.549> goes<00:02:47.760> for

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
whenever you land on it same goes for

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
these traps and deal the only problem I

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.740 
these traps and deal the only problem I
have<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.889> is<00:04:34.070> that<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:34.880> doesn't<00:04:35.120> like<00:04:35.389> stack

on<00:04:35.960> top<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.169> each<00:04:36.350> other<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:36.800> can't<00:04:37.009> have

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
on top of each other so you can't have

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.310 
on top of each other so you can't have
to<00:04:37.729> jungle<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.240> slaps<00:04:38.509> like<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:38.870> top<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.259> each
