00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.420
 Um, so the beauty folks do the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.250
 teaching to the referred of the music jota quest 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.460
 the sun is 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.980
 it is very short keeps repeating the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.190
 music people bet on the videos then 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.830
 Now you study that giggle for 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.040
 to play with the music to include in it 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.800
 It's good to teach step by step how to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.059
 tablature here fingers right for you 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.220
 is using 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.799
 and whoever is using the pickup always 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.799
 to wear alternating jacket, let's go 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.900
 are on rope 5 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:22.260
 You're going to play house 7 on the same rope. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:28.480
 house 9 on rope number 4 you will play 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.870
 7 9 and 7 again in the first part goes 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.790
 stay like this 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.530
 So you train this little trick then the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:43.420
 ten you will're using is 21 13 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:45.190
 13 again there's going to be a 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.229
 party here I'll need 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.660
 play that note again, just that I'm going 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.470
 change your finger instead of doing it with the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:02:00.190
 one finger I do with what I'm going 2 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 touch that note again touch it 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.260
 so I need is to change this finger at 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.450
 I reach that note I want here 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.830
 underneath it, it will not stay like this 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.350
 note that this last note that I 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.050
 I played is a little bit longer 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.650
 there is still time for you to change the finger're 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:28.480
 You 're going to play 17 here and on rope 4 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:33.230
 You'll play Rope 3 now the 619 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:38.300
 on rope 2 and will play the 7 and will 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.860
 back to 19 on the rope 3 rock then 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.860
 this part was thus 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.010
 so this second part here we to 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.620
 at home 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.900
 Then you 'll do it with your little finger. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.940
 and you will go up here just wake up number 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.770
 4 in the house 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.580
 9 ok 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.200
 will play 19 on rope number 3 if it goes 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:13.120
 play 67 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:20.950
 there it is a little while 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:26.590
 same rope is now on rope 497 and 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.420
 ends on chord number 5 in box 9 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.910
 so this is a good neighbor here 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.850
 What a short word for you and working. 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.780
 just so I try to use the correct fingers 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.420
 It's that I already showed in the song and it's just going 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.210
 training that you can decipher 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.580
 That's it worth to the next
