00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.180
 when car picture in southern french 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.970
 miraval on the test track for handling 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.759
 test loads everything is rank and name 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.309
 at the start and the editors and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.600
 Test driver test by car image test 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.580
 drive brakes and accelerate yourself 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.140
 car picture comes every year once in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.910
 south of france on the test track 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.529
 by God and makes the big hands 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.150
 Compare braking to accelerate speeding 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.309
 And the lap times are driving here 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.290
 the motto 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.930
 The lap times are from a man 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.390
 with gasoline in the blood determines dirk mÃ¶ller 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.879
 sunday the conditions are so for 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 all candidates equal time for one 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.020
 exploration of the 33 kilometer long 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.020
 straight on the start goal 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.130
 Stop coming to a little harassment 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.130
 Full travel must be second gear 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.490
 right left combination 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.250
 continue one 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.450
 fast 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450
 but right over 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.479
 in short, all brakes from the bend 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.730
 look at the change of power as 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.510
 car sticks 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.510
 rescue 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.210
 the 10s quickly left in front of the bayern 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.260
 Let's talk about the short 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.260
 come to the opposite 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.260
 again full in the iron 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120
 he is doing very well 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.620
 actually relatively easy to drive very 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.620
 gt r 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.750
 put anyway 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.750
 uphill passage 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 Almost with caspar 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.290
 10 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.290
 raid the curbs a bit 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.069
 saddle paddles unfortunately a sexual 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.209
 Installed 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.659
 that is, it happens one more time 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.659
 rethink a bit 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.220
 and now we come back over a 90 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.220
 Grad return to the start-target straight 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.940
 the test track of me does not matter as 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.739
 racing track and is therefore 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.610
 so nice to drive because they just not 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.550
 synthetic course is just stop 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.260
 naturally nestles in the landscape and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.150
 interesting curves has the beautiful 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.040
 The track is that you are very much here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.349
 can be traveling fast that one 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.660
 a lot of confessed kites 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.910
 can cover area 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.040
 you can drive over 220 with this 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 Big cars we tested it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.930
 There is a small mountain course where the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.790
 turns very tight where you are very nice 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 can try something in tight curves 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.569
 works is very varied 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.160
 you can the the partially turned 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.230
 do not see so it is the whole day 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
 On the way, the course becomes interesting 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.670
 not boring to an objective 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.200
 test of car image it also belongs to that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.880
 All cars are weighed 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.319
 agree the results with the information 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.299
 the manufacturer about one 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.410
 henning klipp gives the data of 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.209
 vehicles directly into his laptop a in 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.980
 every car becomes the measuring device 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.000
 installs the data captured and 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.859
 evaluated 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.260
 in the car picture you can find the 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.590
 results then again that are pure 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.590
 facts 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.239
 yes we have to basically with one 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.790
 measuring system from race logic das 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.180
 satellite-based acceleration and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.400
 Delay picks up without that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.349
 any external devices are necessary 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.610
 as formerly had you praised rat that 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.200
 everything is very modern today 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.910
 yes the two objective measurement 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.610
 Braking acceleration during braking 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.580
 we have ten braking operations out of 100 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.260
 be started and until 0 and at 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 accelerate is a standing start 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.780
 from zero to 200 also takes over here 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.760
 only a tester the task the bolides 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.989
 to accelerate around an objective 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.989
 result 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.340
 flow in a big handling comparison 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.229
 but also other criteria the 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.910
 previously determined by the editor 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.940
 be included in the evaluation 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.729
 for example, driving sound or too 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.040
 fascination points always for 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.990
 Discussions worry 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.330
 but in the end there is always a result 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.060
 and then the winners are in the 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:48.050
 Categories supersporters of lamborghini
