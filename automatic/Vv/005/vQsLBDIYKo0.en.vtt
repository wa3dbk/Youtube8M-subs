00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.240
 everyone is at score 64 1166 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 sings of spicheren blur today on 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.429
 finds himself for the new snub 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 face with glitch camouflage chameleon 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 it is in the case of popular tv 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.960
 finally popular communities this is where 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.439
 first is called yesterday camo so 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.180
 I throw 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.320
 and by the way, it's really something 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 it's not like we liked them 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.210
 do it's really pgm from the computer 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.170
 must be said so you will see in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.149
 do if you do not know that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.190
 camouflage that change color 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.329
 randomly 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.100
 when I say randomly about the fact 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.079
 it does not change every second 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 or years it's not in loop mode what's that 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.050
 changes according to a time defined by the pgm 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
 of the computer so that's basically they 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 could put a second off 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 between two tricks like ten minutes so 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 there you can already see that it's red 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.829
 that's how vexed are color because 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120
 good I have to wait 50 years to be able to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.510
 to show you another color that must 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.159
 not be super super cool too ok so 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.600
 okay 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.259
 lost your head you have no more head on 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.670
 shoulders my guy can you change from 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.200
 color my guy please good good 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.500
 in any case could that already 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.450
 colors that I have there are not abate 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.799
 shutter so there you could see it in 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.200
 live a live my mouth that color by 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.270
 bt again here is it 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.369
 there you could see live so you 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.289
 have seen that can change very quickly 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.819
 as we can wait 50 years to have 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.319
 a color so here you have been able 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:47.280
 see another color it's really a 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.929
 system that was that was well done 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 this is unfortunately in my opinion we can 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.530
 no we can not play with online 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.390
 it's really a shame but it's there 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.130
 frankly it's well done so here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.140
 there you could see that he changed 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.759
 again against the c was super too 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.149
 quickly I understood what comes from 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.970
