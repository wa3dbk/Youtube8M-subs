 condensed milk and not a can is okay 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.420
 super simple to do 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 So what we'll need is just the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.990
 box of sweet milk girl on paper 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:38.780
 aluminum is very simple very easy and 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:38.780
 Let's fight until the boy domain 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:57.559
 the skin is to pick up foil and let's go 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.559
 to roll for five meters on paper or im 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.920
 here facing up 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.440
 so the two sides face up 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.039
 it will not stay this way 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:42.530
 then this part with nothing that retained 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:42.530
 end and this part here facing up to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:52.710
 Let's get the pressure cooker. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.960

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:23.939
 especially month is something will cover like this 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.519
 It does not have to be too much with both of you. 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:39.060
 little fingers is enough 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:47.879
 Ah, okay, then it's bad you go. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:53.129
 decrease aluminum and fire 45 minutes 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.500
 If you 're in a hurry, I'll go. 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.109

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:20.430
 pan 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:24.269
 It's already over there in the 45 minutes. 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.129
 I 'm going to turn off the fire on the hill. 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:32.430
 I'll get a spoon 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.609
 I do not have a spoon and I'll put it here. 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.609

 good here means when she stops 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:19.500
 leaving steam means that it is the pressure 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:30.930
 He fell all you will accent is're not there 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:38.940

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:41.670
 aluminum foil from which it can not be 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.380
 holding hands in there is people because 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.340

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.380
