00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
next tree that doesn't give me a whole

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
lot of overhang on this side but I am

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.129 
lot of overhang on this side but I am
dry<00:02:46.670> I'm<00:02:47.150> counting<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.810> fact<00:02:47.840> that

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
dry I'm counting on the fact that

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.780 
dry I'm counting on the fact that
probably<00:02:48.739> won't<00:02:48.829> have<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> lot<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.280> wind<00:02:49.549> driven

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
probably won't have a lot of wind driven

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.150 
probably won't have a lot of wind driven
rain<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.350> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.500> be<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.769> drizzle

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
rain it's just going to be this drizzle

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.900 
rain it's just going to be this drizzle
all<00:02:52.370> night<00:02:52.609> so<00:02:54.130> I've<00:02:55.130> really<00:02:55.489> done<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.670> review

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
all night so I've really done a review

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.479 
all night so I've really done a review
on<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.329> on<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.660> bushcraft<00:02:57.019> tarp<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:58.250> will

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
on the on the bushcraft tarp and I will

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.479 
on the on the bushcraft tarp and I will
in<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.670> near<00:02:58.849> future<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.540> a<00:03:00.280> lot<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.310> guys

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
in the near future but a lot of guys

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.370 
in the near future but a lot of guys
often<00:03:01.670> wonder<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.329> 10<00:03:02.569> by<00:03:02.720> 10<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.109> enough

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
often wonder if the 10 by 10 is enough

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.670 
often wonder if the 10 by 10 is enough
