00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 this batman costume in which team I am 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 This nobleman is my office and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.679
 You from china plus a HDTV appeared 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.480
 some days on the internet the new clothes of the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.039
 neighborhood that the beneficial will use in the new 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 zack snyder vs batman versus 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.119
 superbike I do not know nor will it be 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
 definite name even in the movie because 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 initially it looked like it was going to be the name 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
 the movie looks more like they are now 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 treating this name as they had 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.240
 dworkin time what is the name that is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.440
 being used during separate production 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.210
 that will drop then I'll leave soon clear 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.129
 that when the news came out that the beneficial 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.670
 and live the batman in the new movie of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.050
 superman I was cautious 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.210
 optimistic unlike the internet in 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 Overall I wanted to basically lynch the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 man can not blame us 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 entirely because the last time the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.829
 beneficial wore a superhero costume 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.539
 come the shit that came out the rehearsal had people 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 who said that a good movie only that I 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.739
 I doubt very much that the attention that man 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 is now giving the franchise allow 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 that the nut and similar breaker happen 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.350
 again 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.350
 then I was already cautiously optimistic 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.659
 let's go 12 chances does not give chance because 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.430
 optimistic tone but cautiously 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.780
 optimistic I want I want to like 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.340
 just like kiss like the movie 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.860
 superman, I'm going to watch. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.509
 this continuation wanting to like the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 beneficent with low I think for the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.170
 China saw the three had hostile will 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 to serve his photo in the amateur where he 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 start without paying a little bit here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 said that if we reject at the time but 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 then see the legal sic channel photos 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
 I was even more excited seeing the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.540
 neighborhood clothing that will appear on the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.579
 movie and it looks like I'm not a fan of drying 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.619
 I read more sea ​​but the course fucking 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.329
 hits record those who enjoy long gone 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.000
 many rumors that the plot of the new movie 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.530
 would be very inspired in the docs wiltord the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.790
 frank miller's classic comic 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.740
 this new bass suit looks like 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.659
 confirm this influence you see several 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.909
 elements that were present in this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.399
 table cloth first 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.930
 new movie looks more like tissue than 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.939
 the clothing of the previous films that the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.009
 basically wore an armor of 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899
 touch the bat symbol on the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.490
 his chest is also greater than or equal to 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.860
 doc rivers design 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.970
 You have the ears too. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 little ones that are very different from 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970
 movie theater 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 in the recent neighborhood of zack snyder also 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 showed a little of the new batmobile 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.750
 which has batmobile influences more 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.180
 classic but still reminiscent of the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.409
 tumblr that was the batmóvel of the trilogy of the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 christ venom voting a little bit 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.370
 Beware, I really have to confess. 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.890
 I 've never read the whole picture myself. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.299
 I'm going now in anticipation of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.250
 movie I already started to read a comic 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.900
 several times in the past I stopped make 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.760
 by half and I know that if I 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.079
 reason is that the user wants with all 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.079
 respect to the work of frank miller 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 with all due respect to the importance 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.879
 sleeps on the blitz has in the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.269
 character that art at least our 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.650
 do not do not come, do not do not come 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.019

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.220
 Sorry, we need to be honest. 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.049
 da cme jones is fucking enough for you 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.000
 You do not have to lie about 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.040
 a few meters where she leaves a little 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 to desire and have to listen and nothing is 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.750
 perfect and the art of comics 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.730
 in my honest opinion is the most 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 low but anyway I 'm excited to 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.849
 fucking to see this movie I want 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.739

 What did you think of the neighborhood's new clothes? 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.849
 was a little more confident of the 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.900
 beneficial because to see that there worsened coke 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.250
