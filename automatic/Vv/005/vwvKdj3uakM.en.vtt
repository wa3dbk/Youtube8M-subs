figures but I have a pretty good at
least<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.790> think<00:02:43.910> decent<00:02:44.720> WWE<00:02:45.350> slash<00:02:45.860> WWF<00:02:46.580> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
least I think decent WWE slash WWF the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.850 
least I think decent WWE slash WWF the
action<00:02:47.270> figure<00:02:47.510> collection<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.260> honestly

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
action figure collection and honestly

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.390 
action figure collection and honestly
this<00:02:49.640> has<00:02:50.030> probably<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.660> best<00:02:51.370> likeness<00:02:52.370> to

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
this has probably the best likeness to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.150 
this has probably the best likeness to
the<00:02:52.580> actual<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.750> character<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.710> I've<00:02:54.890> ever

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
the actual that character that I've ever

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.430 
the actual that character that I've ever
really<00:02:55.640> seen<00:02:55.940> this<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:56.750> really

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
really seen this is just really

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.430 
really seen this is just really
absolutely<00:02:58.400> stunning<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.600> paint<00:02:59.930> on<00:03:00.140> here

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
absolutely stunning the paint on here

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.010 
absolutely stunning the paint on here
everything<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:00.980> very<00:03:01.010> crisp<00:03:01.760> very<00:03:02.270> clean<00:03:02.690> and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
everything is very crisp very clean and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.800 
everything is very crisp very clean and
as<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.380> said<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.800> likeness<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.490> top-notch<00:03:05.120> now

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
as I said the likeness is top-notch now

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.810 
as I said the likeness is top-notch now
looking<00:03:06.410> at<00:03:06.560> his<00:03:06.680> accessories<00:03:07.130> he<00:03:07.400> doesn't

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
looking at his accessories he doesn't

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.280 
looking at his accessories he doesn't
come<00:03:08.090> with<00:03:08.209> much<00:03:08.390> but<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.660> mean<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
come with much but I mean it's a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
come with much but I mean it's a
wrestling<00:03:09.620> figure<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:09.980> what<00:03:10.100> do<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.220> expect

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
wrestling figure so what do you expect

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.310 
wrestling figure so what do you expect
he<00:03:10.820> does<00:03:11.000> come<00:03:11.240> with<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.600> very<00:03:11.810> iconic

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
he does come with this very iconic

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.199 
he does come with this very iconic
baseball<00:03:12.890> bat<00:03:13.070> but<00:03:13.459> unfortunately<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.060> can

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
baseball bat but unfortunately you can

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.570 
baseball bat but unfortunately you can
see<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> handles<00:03:15.020> bent<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.709> would

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
see that the handles bent so that would

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.820 
see that the handles bent so that would
probably<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.240> require<00:03:17.660> some<00:03:18.140> kind<00:03:18.680> of

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
probably just require some kind of

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.130 
probably just require some kind of
melting<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.700> bit<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.209> then<00:03:20.660> freezing

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
melting a little bit and then freezing

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.020 
melting a little bit and then freezing
it<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.680> kind<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.040> get<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.520> more<00:03:22.730> straight

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it to kind of get it in a more straight

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.370 
it to kind of get it in a more straight
position<00:03:23.240> or<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.510> could<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:23.750> do<00:03:24.020> it<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.230> way

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
position or I could just do it that way

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.740 
position or I could just do it that way
and<00:03:24.530> it'll<00:03:25.040> probably<00:03:25.190> not<00:03:25.520> stay<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.820> way<00:03:26.120> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
and it'll probably not stay that way and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.660 
and it'll probably not stay that way and
then<00:03:26.900> he<00:03:26.990> also<00:03:27.170> does<00:03:27.530> come<00:03:27.860> with<00:03:28.040> his<00:03:28.280> black

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
then he also does come with his black

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.970 
then he also does come with his black
jacket<00:03:29.270> which<00:03:29.450> really<00:03:30.020> does<00:03:30.380> look<00:03:30.680> great<00:03:30.860> on

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.850 
the silver paint here with the buckle so
really<00:05:15.930> cool<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.260> then<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.410> can<00:05:16.560> see<00:05:16.710> that

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
really cool and then you can see that

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.980 
really cool and then you can see that
he's<00:05:17.010> got<00:05:17.490> black<00:05:17.700> hands<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.330> that's<00:05:18.480> kind<00:05:18.900> of

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
he's got black hands but that's kind of

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.900 
he's got black hands but that's kind of
done<00:05:19.530> up<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.830> look<00:05:19.980> like<00:05:20.010> he's<00:05:20.310> wearing<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.730> pair

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
done up to look like he's wearing a pair

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.440 
done up to look like he's wearing a pair
of<00:05:21.000> gloves

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
of gloves

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.150 
of gloves
the<00:05:21.660> articulation<00:05:22.290> wise<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.770> can<00:05:22.800> see<00:05:23.010> that

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
the articulation wise you can see that

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.470 
the articulation wise you can see that
his<00:05:23.220> head<00:05:23.430> is<00:05:23.580> on<00:05:23.730> this<00:05:23.910> ball<00:05:24.090> joint<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:24.420> you

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
his head is on this ball joint so you

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.030 
his head is on this ball joint so you
get<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.660> nice<00:05:24.900> full<00:05:25.200> range<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.590> motion<00:05:25.920> there

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
get a nice full range of motion there

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.950 
get a nice full range of motion there
the<00:05:26.400> shoulders<00:05:26.820> here<00:05:26.970> on<00:05:27.120> pin<00:05:27.450> joints<00:05:27.780> so<00:05:27.870> they

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
the shoulders here on pin joints so they

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.290 
the shoulders here on pin joints so they
move<00:05:28.200> in<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:28.740> out<00:05:28.860> they<00:05:29.190> also<00:05:29.490> rotate<00:05:30.030> all<00:05:30.270> the

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
move in and out they also rotate all the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.780 
move in and out they also rotate all the
way<00:05:30.420> around<00:05:30.510> he's<00:05:31.050> also<00:05:31.260> got<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> pin<00:05:32.400> section

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
way around he's also got a pin section

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.130 
way around he's also got a pin section
here<00:05:33.000> at<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.210> upper<00:05:33.300> part<00:05:33.420> of<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.720> bicep<00:05:34.110> and

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
here at the upper part of the bicep and

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.140 
here at the upper part of the bicep and
getting<00:05:34.410> real<00:05:34.710> great<00:05:35.310> detail<00:05:35.730> with<00:05:35.940> the

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
getting real great detail with the

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.970 
getting real great detail with the
actual<00:05:36.480> musculature<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> arms<00:05:37.860> and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
actual musculature of the arms and

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.470 
actual musculature of the arms and
things<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.310> nature<00:05:38.400> he<00:05:38.970> bends<00:05:39.180> here<00:05:39.390> at

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
things of that nature he bends here at

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.540 
things of that nature he bends here at
the<00:05:39.570> only<00:05:40.110> one<00:05:40.260> single<00:05:40.590> bend<00:05:40.920> note<00:05:41.100> which<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.520> a

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
the only one single bend note which is a

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.100 
the only one single bend note which is a
little<00:05:41.790> unfortunate<00:05:42.060> you<00:05:42.390> got<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.600> forward<00:05:43.020> and

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
little unfortunate you got a forward and

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900 
little unfortunate you got a forward and
back<00:05:43.260> here<00:05:43.470> at<00:05:43.530> the<00:05:43.620> wrist<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:44.040> rotates<00:05:44.430> you've

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
back here at the wrist it rotates you've

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.060 
back here at the wrist it rotates you've
got<00:05:45.030> an<00:05:45.150> upper<00:05:45.480> abs<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.440> can<00:05:46.590> see<00:05:46.710> as<00:05:46.890> you

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
got an upper abs and you can see as you

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.850 
got an upper abs and you can see as you
bring<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.370> back<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:48.060> actual<00:05:48.660> design<00:05:49.410> does

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
bring it back that actual design does

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.610 
bring it back that actual design does
carry<00:05:50.280> through<00:05:50.550> so<00:05:50.790> you<00:05:50.850> do<00:05:51.210> get<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.570> full<00:05:52.380> look

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
carry through so you do get a full look

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.990 
carry through so you do get a full look
with<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:52.950> mean<00:05:53.130> when<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.520> get<00:05:53.640> although<00:05:53.880> out

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
with I mean when you get although out

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.790 
with I mean when you get although out
there<00:05:54.180> kind<00:05:54.390> of<00:05:54.450> disappears<00:05:54.930> but<00:05:55.080> I<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.590> that

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
there kind of disappears but I like that

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.010 
there kind of disappears but I like that
a<00:05:55.950> lot<00:05:56.250> rotates<00:05:56.970> here<00:05:57.150> at<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.330> waist<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.810> hips

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
a lot rotates here at the waist the hips

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.200 
a lot rotates here at the waist the hips
move<00:05:58.320> forward<00:05:58.950> and<00:05:59.160> back<00:05:59.460> they<00:05:59.700> move<00:05:59.940> in<00:06:00.090> and

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
move forward and back they move in and

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.760 
move forward and back they move in and
out<00:06:00.270> they're<00:06:00.480> on<00:06:00.510> ball<00:06:00.900> joints<00:06:01.290> so<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.590> get<00:06:01.740> a

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
out they're on ball joints so you get a

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.620 
out they're on ball joints so you get a
nice<00:06:01.920> range<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.310> motion<00:06:02.370> he<00:06:03.000> rotates<00:06:03.450> at<00:06:03.600> the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
nice range of motion he rotates at the

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.450 
nice range of motion he rotates at the
upper<00:06:03.720> part<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.140> the<00:06:04.230> five<00:06:04.470> but<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:04.830> do<00:06:05.130> lose

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
upper part of the five but you do lose

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.910 
upper part of the five but you do lose
that<00:06:05.760> and<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.060> cohesive<00:06:06.780> look<00:06:07.170> with<00:06:07.500> his<00:06:07.650> legs

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
that and the cohesive look with his legs

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.680 
that and the cohesive look with his legs
when<00:06:08.160> you<00:06:08.220> do<00:06:08.340> is<00:06:08.640> just<00:06:08.820> kind<00:06:09.000> of<00:06:09.090> weird<00:06:09.270> he

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
when you do is just kind of weird he

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.910 
when you do is just kind of weird he
does<00:06:09.870> have<00:06:10.050> two<00:06:10.200> joints<00:06:10.530> here<00:06:10.650> at<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.800> knee

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
does have two joints here at the knee

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.440 
does have two joints here at the knee
which<00:06:11.130> is<00:06:11.280> very<00:06:11.490> nice<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:11.760> you<00:06:12.030> can<00:06:12.180> see<00:06:12.330> that

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
which is very nice and you can see that

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.090 
which is very nice and you can see that
you<00:06:12.570> got<00:06:12.750> this<00:06:12.900> extra<00:06:13.290> middle<00:06:13.650> section<00:06:14.070> here

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
you got this extra middle section here

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.920 
you got this extra middle section here
which<00:06:14.520> is<00:06:14.820> like<00:06:14.970> his<00:06:15.150> knee<00:06:15.360> pad<00:06:15.600> so<00:06:15.810> I<00:06:15.840> do

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
which is like his knee pad so I do

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.050 
which is like his knee pad so I do
appreciate<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.650> he's<00:06:17.220> got<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.460> cut<00:06:17.760> at<00:06:17.940> the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
appreciate that he's got a cut at the

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.210 
appreciate that he's got a cut at the
upper<00:06:18.270> part<00:06:18.480> of<00:06:18.570> his<00:06:18.750> boot<00:06:19.020> moves<00:06:19.560> forward<00:06:20.100> and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
upper part of his boot moves forward and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.100 
upper part of his boot moves forward and
back<00:06:20.460> in<00:06:20.670> it<00:06:20.820> it<00:06:21.330> feels<00:06:21.720> like<00:06:21.870> there's<00:06:22.050> a

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
back in it it feels like there's a

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.290 
back in it it feels like there's a
little<00:06:22.560> bit<00:06:22.650> of<00:06:22.680> tilde<00:06:23.190> on<00:06:23.520> this<00:06:23.850> one<00:06:24.030> more

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
little bit of tilde on this one more

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.490 
little bit of tilde on this one more
than<00:06:24.480> this<00:06:24.600> one<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:24.900> is<00:06:25.050> really<00:06:25.170> kind<00:06:25.410> of

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
than this one this is really kind of

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.740 
than this one this is really kind of
stiff<00:06:25.740> but<00:06:26.190> you<00:06:26.340> can<00:06:26.550> get<00:06:26.730> a<00:06:26.760> forward<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.540> back

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
stiff but you can get a forward and back

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.480 
stiff but you can get a forward and back
and<00:06:28.020> not<00:06:28.140> forward<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.770> back<00:06:28.890> it<00:06:29.100> on<00:06:29.190> there<00:06:29.370> is

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
and not forward and back it on there is

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.430 
and not forward and back it on there is
kind<00:06:29.790> of<00:06:29.850> stiff<00:06:30.090> but<00:06:30.270> then<00:06:30.450> you<00:06:30.960> do<00:06:31.200> have<00:06:31.410> a

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
kind of stiff but then you do have a

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.590 
kind of stiff but then you do have a
little<00:06:31.650> bit<00:06:31.860> of<00:06:31.950> ankle<00:06:32.310> tilt<00:06:32.700> so<00:06:32.940> a<00:06:33.120> lot<00:06:33.570> of

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
little bit of ankle tilt so a lot of

instead<00:07:23.379> of<00:07:23.530> short<00:07:23.800> packing<00:07:24.159> him<00:07:24.280> he's

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
instead of short packing him he's

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.309 
instead of short packing him he's
basically<00:07:24.909> coming<00:07:25.210> out<00:07:25.360> in<00:07:25.509> a<00:07:25.569> case<00:07:25.810> just<00:07:26.199> by

basically coming out in a case just by

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.080 
basically coming out in a case just by
himself<00:07:26.469> so<00:07:26.889> he<00:07:27.039> should<00:07:27.310> be<00:07:27.400> fairly<00:07:27.699> easy<00:07:27.969> to

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
himself so he should be fairly easy to

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:29.939 
himself so he should be fairly easy to
find<00:07:28.360> but<00:07:28.810> depending<00:07:29.110> on<00:07:29.199> where<00:07:29.500> you<00:07:29.650> do<00:07:29.770> pick

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
find but depending on where you do pick

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.559 
find but depending on where you do pick
him<00:07:30.039> up<00:07:30.129> price<00:07:30.370> obviously<00:07:30.610> will<00:07:31.300> fluctuate

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:31.569 
him up price obviously will fluctuate

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:33.809 
him up price obviously will fluctuate
but<00:07:32.080> you're<00:07:32.560> looking<00:07:32.710> at<00:07:32.889> between<00:07:33.129> twenty<00:07:33.789> and

twenty five dollars is kind of the going
rate<00:07:36.129> I<00:07:36.159> think<00:07:36.280> in<00:07:36.520> some<00:07:36.729> higher<00:07:37.030> retailers

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:37.659

you might get a thirty dollar price but
