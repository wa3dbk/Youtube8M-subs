00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
here in 1994 and play our farewell show

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:56.210 
here in 1994 and play our farewell show
at<00:06:49.810> the<00:06:49.930> KISS<00:06:50.110> concert<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:53.080> we<00:06:53.290> didn't<00:06:53.530> do<00:06:53.620> it

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.469 

and<00:06:57.220> maybe<00:06:57.370> at<00:06:57.580> the<00:06:57.610> time<00:06:57.880> it's<00:06:58.120> because<00:06:58.330> we

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
and maybe at the time it's because we

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.740 
and maybe at the time it's because we
just<00:06:58.510> really<00:06:58.960> didn't<00:06:59.260> want<00:06:59.380> to<00:06:59.440> say<00:06:59.620> farewell

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
and I suppose now it's even better

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.480 
and I suppose now it's even better
because<00:07:07.780> we<00:07:08.139> actually<00:07:08.590> instead<00:07:09.070> of<00:07:09.130> getting

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:09.490
