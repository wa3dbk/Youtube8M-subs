00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 I recommend and with and so we see a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 additional 5 percent discount on 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 buy good first guys here i 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 councilors we are back with a new one 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.590
 episode of will be paid I take that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 tonight you are enjoying it enough 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 although in general with the channel mi 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.500
 like with a little dropped maybe it's due to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.540
 period at the end fifa 15 trip you are 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 a bit tired of seeing videos 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.329
 office at 15 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 soon starts to sign anyway not 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 you worry there will be important 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 exceptional video so I recommend it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 meanwhile let's like name we support 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 this series which is very much anyway 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.210
 valid to my opinion to start at 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.950
 better players today we start from 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 first player matteo darmian has 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.329
 matured at least as you know it is gone either 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.920
 seminal tips really are doing 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 freak manchester united fans 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.149
 playing really well then me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.670
 I imagine an upgrade to say the least 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.290
 considerable for him on fifa 16 maybe 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 here or accentuated a little too much but second 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 me if it were so it would be a fullback 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.950
 really devastating even to make a 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 Italian then I imagine matteo darmian 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.540
 and with 1 plus 4 overall with more 4 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 speed p50 plus 6 race more no triv 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 in all defenses plus 4 physical like 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.729
 heads the skills and three stars weak foot 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 a player really repeats 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.950
 exceptional perhaps the strongest quarterback 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.500
 Italian perhaps it will be really absurd 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 I really hope this is so even though 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.240
 if it will be a 76 77 I here accentuated a little 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.890
 too much but just to make you notice 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 how much this player is doing 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.689
 well to the united will be anyway 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 devastating other player who is de jong 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.530
 why inserted this second player 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.909
 maybe you could be a bit anomalous 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.420
 because speed is not really the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.280
 maximum 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 if you notice this player though 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.299
 this year the versions he has had 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.850
 you will realize that he made one 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.759
 season to say the least exceptional and then the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 my wish is what the speed 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.540
 finally begins not to count so 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.119
 as much as it was in these 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.159
 last because as in fifa still 15 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.290
 unfortunately the speed counted a lot 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 so I imagine more than anything else 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.760
 that speed is not so important 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.390
 precisely to be able to enhance also 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.250
 players 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.620
 of the genus type de jong players with 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.230
 a speed not excellent but with a shot 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.540
 so with a physicist as a true attacker 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 not really strong area striker 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.160
 so in my opinion we really hope 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.930
 let this happen in the meantime 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 of on.li predicts it as a plus 4 of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.470
 overall received a lot of versions 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.440
 informs that the team decided therefore 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 I think this software aid will be with 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.560
 all speeds plus four plus two 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.840
 steps to more known ming defenses more or 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.520
 the less the more physical one will remain with three 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.530
 video stars weak and 2 stars skillen 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.910
 the only flaw probably of this 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.860
 player that otherwise could be 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.630
 really used in an inheritance 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.580
 quiet but many but the player who 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.680
 it seems I also added it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.260
 may seem abnormal I repeat for you 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.120
 the speed that it is not that I repeat to you 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.830
 my wish xvi that speed does not 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.630
 be as fundamental as been 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.150
 this year pareo he is a player 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.040
 very similar to the rakitic like 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.630
 features the only thing that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.580
 could have an advantage over the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.709
 racket c is that precisely the price the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.080
 price because being at least a din 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.239
 I hope it is , its price will not be 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.030
 too high also because I 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.470
 I imagine with 82 of overall with more than two 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.030
 speed plus 2 shot plus one passed to 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.950
 close in a more physical defense close 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.840
 or less than the 4- star weak foot and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.670
 three stars skill I repeat to you 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.610
 characteristics similar to the spine one 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.489
 very good throw above average a 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.739
 exceptional dribbling a lot 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.480
 good too with a decent physique is 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.340
 a defense that is not exactly the best 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.320
 a player that I repeat to you anyway 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.090
 maybe it will not be ideal to use 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.670
 just precisely paired with the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.959
 Croatian bar midfielder knows not 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.790
 it will be just ideal because I am too 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.160
 similar as a player but maybe used a 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.500
 flank side as it could be 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 busquets as it should be now 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.370
 obviously no one else to one more 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.470
 defensive could really do the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.500
 difference in my opinion so I hope that 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.970
 he too be paid because he too 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.530
 deserves the version you move decided no 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.820
 this player was devastating 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.239
 try it if you haven't done it yet 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.489
 because I believe it doesn't cost much but it was 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.870
 however very strong so we hope good 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.670
 for this player we hope well too 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.049
 for de jong and we hope especially good 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.329
 for darmian darmian more than one 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.190
 predict a certainty because this 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.780
 player in my opinion it is outstanding 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.550
 is showing very well in bpl 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 well guys this video ends here me 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.370
 I hope you enjoyed it as usual 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.120
 cia not like to enroll in the channel if 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.800
 you haven't done yet 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.910
 thank you as always for the vision 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.910
 Hi everyone
