00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.870
 and this 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 to cure it I will go through this where 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.079
 I make the molcajete sauce that he uses 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.079
 anything 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.049
 now let's start adult because no 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.820
 be very very demolished 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.080
 but so stolen that the pieces are not left 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.920
 big 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.979
 A) Yes 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.259
 no the purchase applies to your taste but 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.770
 those minutes only as you like 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.399
 like this 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.399
 there it is 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.140
 I'm not going to cut it with scissors and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.560
 let's start we're going to put the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.560
 apple 5 apples of the 3 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.220
 regular not very large are with the 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.700
 very small and since I have the pineapple already 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.860
 in pieces and that is how we are going to put 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.860
 once we are going to remove the juice 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 all the games of the game that you can 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.170
 remove 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:39.860
 we have pineapple and we are going to drain the juice 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.860
 that is still in the tin 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.840
 and so we are emptying 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.610
 it's so easy because it was more with bullets 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 cans and here explains the pineapple is coming 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.090
 of the wheel cuts it into pieces and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.280
 chopped more healthy and that's it 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.800
 and the salad is very rich 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 can accompany it with any meat 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.450
 with any food that you like 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.990
 equal the amount is also to taste 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.500
 the potatoes 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.500
 now we are going to put him once 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.410
 pinion 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.959
 let's put the pinion I'm going to put almost 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.269
 most and the others leave a 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.269
 little to put it on 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.360
 now let's put the cream myself 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.360
 check this cream 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.840
 I'm going to put this 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.760
 I'm going to put him I'm going to put half and 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.110
 according to how we are going to see if it makes us 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.110
 it's missing because we're putting more 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.080
 there is 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.760
 and I'm going to put the mayonnaise once 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.820
 so that knowing how to be come back to everything together 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.880
 I'm going to put half of this jar 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.750
 a little less either that does not have 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.190
 a lot of mayonnaise let's see if with 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.580
 this is enough to see do not take away 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.580
 much 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.210
 and now let's move it 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.610
 you do not have to get anything or sugar or 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.950
 nothing because you can make sweet fruits 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.210
 we do not need to put anything else 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.110
 return it 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.990
 to love it with the pinion and the nut and 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.980
 we close a gelato either you can 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:06.550
 eat alone or accompanied by the state 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.710
 with a meat a fish on your equipment 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.980
 I do not know about you like 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.350
 I think necessary more is more cream anima 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.860
 the table and it seems that it is already 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.449
 enough 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.379
 you do not have to do much 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.379
 stir it 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.759
 and it's good it sounds delicious very delicious 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.759
 and also 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.140
 we are going to 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.140
