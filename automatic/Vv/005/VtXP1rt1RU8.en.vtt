00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 or the badges and compass and welcome to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.109
 another new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.150
 titulo youtube faults and notice 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 important and this was something that they 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 I wanted to talk today because 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.580
 recently youtube has had some 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 failures and I also wanted to tell them a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 notice something important that I know that to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
 many people may interest you ok and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.350
 well you will remember what it does 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.810
 some days I had told them that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 youtube admitted his mistakes and talked about 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 everything that was happening and they said that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 they wanted to make the platform better and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 much easier and this was published in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 your YouTube channel create orts not in the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 which mentioned in some of the failures 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.690
 and that this error did not just happen to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.370
 small people but big people 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.860
 also so today I 'm going to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.539
 I'm just going to help you solve that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 I fail and I also want you to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.289
 do with any channel that you like 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.700
 suppose this must be done so that my 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 videos always reach them since the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 videos like that sometimes do not go do not usually 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
 get what they must do to make the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.379
 pencil do well will be to address me 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.910
 channel that I suggest you do 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 with mine since if they like me 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.239
 content that's the best way to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 it arrives to them and a week does not arrive 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.050
 after or after that it does not reach them yet 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.000
 then pass them some 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.250
 failures here as you see it I find myself in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 my main channel from the channel 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 secondary since if not I would not 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.700
 I would let you teach them this option so 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
 we go to the nut here and how 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.570
 that these pictures are going to come out 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 unmarked we mark the two pictures 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.890
 and once they have already marked the two 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.810
 pictures what they should do will be to oppress 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.150
 blue button what is there as they see 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 says that I want to receive news and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 little else and that is what they should 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.300
 do if they like other channels 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.770
 also do it with other channels like this 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.530
 What guys please I ask you to leave 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.660
 like in this video since it's very 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.430
 important for a lot of people this because 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.260
 if not, the videos do not arrive and they pass 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.660
 very strange things not here as they see it 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.910
 surcharge and then well I would get super 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.680
 well the content that I want now 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.030
 give an important notice remember that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.010
 they can only do with any channel 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.480
 that you like it a lot as I have 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.070
 done with other channels that are more a 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.290
 interesting content not for me 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.630
 come all the news I give you that and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.590
 they will come to my life without any kind 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.940
 error ok 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.740
 those are the two while in what 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.210
 youtube is repairing its failures that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.790
 they already accept that there are some failures 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.380
 it's like a small arrangement that can be 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.780
 do right for now 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
 I'm going to give you an important notice I saw that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.190
 many people in the comments I was 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 putting comments like after the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.970
 tricks and all that prevented me much 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.730
 people who upload a different content 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.040
 or more than anything new content like that 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.990
 that today dawns and I started to 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.030
 see some things I did the things that 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.250
 had to do and I got into the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.230
 computer and I'm a fan of all 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.050
 the big car saga then I 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.880
 I proposed and now I want to bring you new ones 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.980
 gameplays but it's not just big 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.900
 5 points but also from big car 4 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.220
 that is playing with mods since they are 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.620
 pretty funny and you can do 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120
 a lot of things like lately what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 we have done in big cars 5 of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.050
 computer then I want to bring you 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 Emos variety of large gameplays 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.430
 car 4 of big auto san andreas more 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.810
 that no gta previous to that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.420
 we are playing today that is the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 great car 5 and it was what I want to do ok 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 I want to play 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.370
 what do I know I want I'm already creating a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.520
 series which is called grand theft auto 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.860
 mods in which I play with mods that I eat 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.810
 be it ironman's on July or others 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.430
 more and it is something that has proposed me to do 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.600
 since I do not have a good time 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.220
 playing this type of games too 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.350
 can you give me some recommendations 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.020
 once someday play another type of game 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.820
 but all this is apart to the content 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.890
 that we have today of great 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.200
 5 cars no longer be the mods either 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.270
 some important things that I tell you 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.010
 some important information or a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.560
 gameplay also grand theft auto 5 and 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.360
 that's totally apart more like to 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.130
 give a more variety to the channel 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.800
 since I like many others 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.420
 Yes, I think they are pretty good 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.070
 so chao is now what I wanted them 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.530
 say today because practically 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.320
 was this about this failure I wanted to talk to you 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.450
 Many people have already seen this failure 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.490
 Many people know it and the truth is that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.110
 it is a bad thing that this fault exists but 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.120
 unfortunately you can not yet 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 do something to fix it if it's not 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.450
 this method so kids wait for them 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.770
 have liked this video you have your 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.720
 opinion in the comments and also 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.340
 tell your opinion about the new 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.620
 activity that I want to upload to the channel 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.570
 apart from the big car 5 upload other types 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.550
 of big cars and I can also upload 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.530
 suddenly another kind of games like network 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.270
 dead redemption others belonging to 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.770
 the rockstar games company also 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.140
 Later, I really like the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.790
 shooters I have planned when the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.470
 black ops 3 play it because I like a 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.510
 heap the black ops 2 loved it 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.310
 like it's going to be very good and it was something 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.390
 I wanted to tell you today like this 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.370
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.510

 and without more than saying goodbye goodbye
