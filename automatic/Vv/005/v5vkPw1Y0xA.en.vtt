we checked out all the tools we're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.430 
we checked out all the tools we're
between<00:00:44.910> three<00:00:45.480> designs<00:00:45.810> right<00:00:45.990> now<00:00:46.200> we're

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
between three designs right now we're

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.620 
between three designs right now we're
doing<00:00:46.830> an<00:00:46.890> in-ground<00:00:47.220> concrete<00:00:47.820> pool

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.360 

we're<00:00:53.110> in<00:00:53.200> phase<00:00:53.380> one<00:00:53.680> right<00:00:53.860> now<00:00:53.980> so<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.250> goes

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
we're in phase one right now so it goes

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.860 
we're in phase one right now so it goes
the<00:00:54.490> design<00:00:54.790> stage<00:00:55.060> or<00:00:55.270> getting<00:00:55.480> some<00:00:55.630> boats

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
the design stage or getting some boats

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.080 
the design stage or getting some boats
are<00:00:56.080> working<00:00:56.320> with<00:00:56.440> different<00:00:56.590> diners<00:00:57.090> once

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
are working with different diners once

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.310 
are working with different diners once
we<00:00:58.240> decide<00:00:58.510> which<00:00:58.690> oh<00:00:58.780> we're<00:00:58.900> gonna<00:00:59.050> text

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
we decide which oh we're gonna text

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.240 
we decide which oh we're gonna text
because<00:00:59.530> we<00:00:59.590> have<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.770> wait<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.980> see<00:01:00.040> if<00:01:00.130> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
because we have to wait to see if the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.710 
because we have to wait to see if the
city<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.520> actually<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.330> one<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.540> their

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
city is actually the one of their

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.660 
city is actually the one of their
supposed<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.080> open<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.250> don't<00:01:03.430> want<00:01:03.460> to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
supposed to open it you don't want to

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.930 
supposed to open it you don't want to
the<00:01:03.790> same

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.400 

so<00:01:08.940> then<00:01:09.120> we're<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.080> soil

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
so then we're going to then do soil

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.620 
so then we're going to then do soil
drilling<00:01:10.950> test<00:01:11.190> see<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:11.850> deep<00:01:12.120> we<00:01:12.300> can<00:01:12.480> go

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
drilling test see how deep we can go

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510 
drilling test see how deep we can go
doesn't<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.620> shallow<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> deep<00:01:14.370> end

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
doesn't want a shallow into the deep end

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950 
doesn't want a shallow into the deep end
so<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.910> have<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.090> for<00:01:15.240> beginners<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.780> also

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
so we can have it for beginners but also

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.600 
so we can have it for beginners but also
have<00:01:16.230> it<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.620> experts<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
have it for the experts as well so it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580 
have it for the experts as well so it's
a<00:01:17.760> challenge<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.180> everybody<00:01:18.600> yeah<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.470> then

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a challenge for everybody yeah and then

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560 
a challenge for everybody yeah and then
we're<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.830> build<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.520> lace<00:01:20.730> concrete

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
we're going to build with lace concrete

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.850 
we're going to build with lace concrete
and<00:01:21.720> concrete<00:01:21.870> come<00:01:22.230> is<00:01:22.350> don't<00:01:22.560> any<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.830> have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and concrete come is don't any we have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.740 
and concrete come is don't any we have
three<00:01:23.190> sponsors<00:01:23.730> so<00:01:23.910> far<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> need<00:01:24.420> three<00:01:24.720> more

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
three sponsors so far we need three more

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
three sponsors so far we need three more
to<00:01:25.110> give<00:01:25.230> their<00:01:25.380> name<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to give their name on there and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.130 
to give their name on there and
realistically<00:01:27.390> it'll<00:01:27.870> prolly<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.380> fall

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
realistically it'll prolly be the fall

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
realistically it'll prolly be the fall
2010<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.410> it's<00:01:32.010> going<00:01:32.190> behind<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.760> halfpipe

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
2010 so it's going behind the halfpipe

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.590 
2010 so it's going behind the halfpipe
writer<00:01:33.630> they<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.840> behind<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.200> half

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.960 

coping<00:01:45.600> block<00:01:45.870> or<00:01:46.110> steal<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.730> very<00:01:47.940> good

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
coping block or steal it's a very good

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.640 
coping block or steal it's a very good
question<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.960> sure<00:01:49.230> yet<00:01:49.440> if<00:01:49.590> it's

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
question we are not sure yet if it's

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.470 
question we are not sure yet if it's
going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.980> be<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> old<00:01:50.400> pool<00:01:50.730> coping<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.330> the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
going to be the old pool coping with the
