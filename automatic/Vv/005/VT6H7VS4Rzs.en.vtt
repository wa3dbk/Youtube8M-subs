three dollars and I know it's mostly
from<00:03:57.930> mineral<00:03:58.200> eyeshadow<00:03:58.350> but<00:03:58.739> I've<00:03:58.860> been

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
from mineral eyeshadow but I've been

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.490 
from mineral eyeshadow but I've been

using it for regular eyeshadow and I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.410 
using it for regular eyeshadow and I
think<00:04:01.800> it<00:04:01.890> does<00:04:02.070> its<00:04:02.250> job<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:02.730> really<00:04:03.030> really

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
think it does its job it's really really

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.240 
think it does its job it's really really
trying<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.110> can't<00:04:04.350> afford<00:04:04.440> other<00:04:04.860> primers

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
trying if you can't afford other primers

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.150 
trying if you can't afford other primers
this<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:06.030> good<00:04:06.330> start<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:07.590> doesn't<00:04:08.070> really

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
this is a good start it doesn't really

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.660 
this is a good start it doesn't really
hold<00:04:08.489> um<00:04:09.440> like<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.769> as<00:04:10.950> vibrant<00:04:11.280> your

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
eyeshadows won't look as vibrant as they

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.360 
eyeshadows won't look as vibrant as they
will<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:14.010> say<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:15.000> face<00:04:15.270> or<00:04:15.630> um<00:04:16.190> yeah<00:04:17.190> to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
faint shadow

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.370 
faint shadow
at<00:04:18.370> urban<00:04:18.670> decay<00:04:18.940> but<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.630> mean<00:04:19.959> it<00:04:20.050> doesn't

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
at urban decay but I mean it doesn't

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.700 
at urban decay but I mean it doesn't
straub<00:04:20.650> it's<00:04:20.920> really<00:04:21.160> trying<00:04:22.530> another<00:04:23.530> thing

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
straub it's really trying another thing

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.620 
straub it's really trying another thing
that<00:04:23.740> i<00:04:23.860> would<00:04:23.980> recommend<00:04:24.580> are<00:04:24.820> there<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.390> shot

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
that i would recommend are there I shot

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.420 
that i would recommend are there I shot
liquid<00:04:26.050> eye<00:04:26.140> shadows<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.130> think<00:04:27.310> these<00:04:27.370> are

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
liquid eye shadows and I think these are

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.640 
liquid eye shadows and I think these are
good<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.910> bases<00:04:28.420> or<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.290> you're<00:04:29.440> just<00:04:29.470> looking

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
good for bases or if you're just looking

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.290 
good for bases or if you're just looking
for<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.250> single<00:04:30.670> color<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.150> don't

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
for like a single color and you don't

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.090 
for like a single color and you don't
want<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.480> worry<00:04:31.660> about<00:04:31.780> like<00:04:31.990> blending<00:04:32.830> and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
want to worry about like blending and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.690 
want to worry about like blending and
all<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.270> good<00:04:34.510> um<00:04:34.840> they<00:04:35.380> dry<00:04:36.340> like

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
really really fast it's so you have to

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.010

doesn't really work that well but the
powder<00:05:00.580> I<00:05:00.760> notice<00:05:01.330> is<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:01.780> really<00:05:02.050> light<00:05:02.440> for

is the darkest they have so if you have
dark<00:05:06.970> eyebrows<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.840> would<00:05:08.110> be<00:05:08.230> wary<00:05:08.530> of<00:05:08.680> that

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
dark eyebrows I would be wary of that

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.520 
dark eyebrows I would be wary of that

but once you put the gel on it it's not

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.420 
but once you put the gel on it it's not
really<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.830> big<00:05:11.980> problem<00:05:13.590> other<00:05:14.590> people<00:05:15.100> love

but i really like the blush and it's
three<00:05:26.170> dollars<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.650> it's<00:05:26.800> definitely<00:05:27.250> worth<00:05:27.460> a

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
three dollars so it's definitely worth a
