00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
right as you can clearly see there's a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.290 
right as you can clearly see there's a
difference<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.800> size<00:00:42.469> size<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.890> thickness

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.470 

yeah<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.680> main<00:00:50.039> difference<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.210> see

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
yeah so the main difference we have see

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
yeah so the main difference we have see
first<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:53.039> won't<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
first what you won't see but you can

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
first what you won't see but you can
feel<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.379> Japanese<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
feel was that the Japanese one has a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
feel was that the Japanese one has a
slipcover<00:00:57.949> see<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.660> slipcover<00:01:00.660> whereas<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
slipcover see a slipcover whereas the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
slipcover see a slipcover whereas the
Japanese<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.539> American<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.199> should<00:01:04.409> say

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
Japanese one the American one should say

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
Japanese one the American one should say
America<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> translated<00:01:06.420> version

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
America one all the translated version

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.670 
America one all the translated version
does<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:08.360> there<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> downfall<00:01:09.930> with<00:01:10.439> that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
does not there is a downfall with that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.899

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
for the translated version and reason is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.130 
for the translated version and reason is

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
be around that place still if you think

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.570

of<00:05:19.880> buying<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.300> older<00:05:20.780> versions<00:05:21.409> like<00:05:21.650> any

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
of buying the older versions like any

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.559 
of buying the older versions like any
well<00:05:23.150> here<00:05:23.479> live<00:05:24.379> volumes<00:05:24.860> one<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.580> probably

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.070 

fifty<00:05:29.569> maybe<00:05:29.919> it<00:05:30.919> will<00:05:31.009> be<00:05:31.599> 390<00:05:32.599> yen<00:05:32.750> which<00:05:32.960> is

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
fifty maybe it will be 390 yen which is

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.080 
fifty maybe it will be 390 yen which is
quite<00:05:33.289> good<00:05:33.319> at<00:05:33.560> ease<00:05:33.740> of<00:05:34.069> that<00:05:34.310> two<00:05:34.520> pounds<00:05:34.969> I

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
quite good at ease of that two pounds I

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.499

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
think'll pool for four or five dollars

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.580 
think'll pool for four or five dollars
American<00:05:39.409> dollars<00:05:39.710> so<00:05:40.669> it's<00:05:40.789> quite<00:05:40.940> good<00:05:41.590> just

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590
