at the gas trap here in the nether and

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.180 
at the gas trap here in the nether and
it's<00:00:09.330> been<00:00:09.510> filling<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.019> with<00:00:10.170> gas<00:00:10.230> while<00:00:11.070> I've

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
it's been filling up with gas while I've

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.810 
it's been filling up with gas while I've
been<00:00:12.139> testing<00:00:13.139> out<00:00:13.259> some<00:00:13.500> things<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.099> threw<00:00:14.639> in

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
been testing out some things I threw in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.269 
been testing out some things I threw in
some<00:00:15.120> rail<00:00:16.049> tracks<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:19.279> quickly

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
some rail tracks here and quickly

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.230 
some rail tracks here and quickly
removed<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:22.820> yeah<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.060> put<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
removed that for now yeah just put a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
removed that for now yeah just put a
cart<00:00:24.570> along<00:00:25.010> that<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.779> within<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.170> glass

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
cart along that is within this glass

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.240 
cart along that is within this glass
wall<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.320> these<00:00:31.320> carts<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:32.040> along

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
wall here and these carts can go along

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.510 
wall here and these carts can go along
here<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.700> pick<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> ghasts<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.520> then

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
here and pick up the ghasts and then

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 
here and pick up the ghasts and then
take<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:35.969> out<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.140> got<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
take them out and I've just got this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.100 
take them out and I've just got this
simple<00:00:37.829> loop<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
simple loop out here for now because I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
simple loop out here for now because I
wanted<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.800> tests<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.629> I<00:00:42.629> wanted<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
wanted to do some tests and I wanted to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.490 
wanted to do some tests and I wanted to
find<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:44.570> blocks<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:46.170> cause

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
find out where blocks would cause

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
find out where blocks would cause
suffocation<00:00:47.070> damage<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.840> gas<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
suffocation damage to the gas now you

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
suffocation damage to the gas now you
may<00:00:51.180> already<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
may already know that if you have a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.990 
may already know that if you have a
solid<00:00:53.100> block<00:00:53.510> above<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.750> track<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
solid block above the track like this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.979 
solid block above the track like this
tall<00:00:57.000> mobs<00:00:57.440> will<00:00:58.440> take<00:00:58.739> suffocation<00:00:59.460> damage

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
tall mobs will take suffocation damage

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
tall mobs will take suffocation damage
going<00:01:00.989> through<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> obviously<00:01:04.369> zombie

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
going through that so obviously zombie

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
going through that so obviously zombie
zombie<00:01:05.400> pigmen<00:01:08.090> any<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> tall<00:01:09.630> mob

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
zombie pigmen any kind of tall mob

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.010 
zombie pigmen any kind of tall mob
skeletons<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:13.430> Endermen<00:01:14.430> won't<00:01:15.020> because

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
skeletons but Endermen won't because

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.370 
skeletons but Endermen won't because
endermen<00:01:16.530> would<00:01:16.740> need<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.250> block<00:01:18.170> one<00:01:19.170> block

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
endermen would need a block one block

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
endermen would need a block one block
higher<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.850> cause<00:01:21.060> suffocation<00:01:21.689> damage<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
higher to cause suffocation damage to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.440 
higher to cause suffocation damage to
them<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.549> they're<00:01:23.820> taller<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.759> similar

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
them as they're taller and in a similar

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.920 
them as they're taller and in a similar
way<00:01:27.500> spiders<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.770> need<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.280> block<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
way spiders would need a block to the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
way spiders would need a block to the
side<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> track<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> take

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
side of the track for them to take

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
side of the track for them to take
damage<00:01:34.790> with<00:01:35.960> ghasts<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.560> combination<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
damage with ghasts it's a combination of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.620 
damage with ghasts it's a combination of
the<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.680> solid<00:01:41.100> blocks<00:01:41.369> out<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the two you can have solid blocks out to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
the two you can have solid blocks out to
the<00:01:42.750> side<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:44.299> in<00:01:45.299> place<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the side like this in place here and the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
the side like this in place here and the
gasps<00:01:47.549> still<00:01:47.939> won't<00:01:47.970> take<00:01:48.390> any<00:01:48.600> damage<00:01:48.810> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
gasps still won't take any damage in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.870 
gasps still won't take any damage in
these<00:01:49.350> spaces<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> side<00:01:51.290> but<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
these spaces off to the side but what I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
these spaces off to the side but what I
will<00:01:54.000> figured<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> go

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
will figured out is that you have to go

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.749 
will figured out is that you have to go
out<00:01:56.040> from<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> track<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.369> up<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.610> this

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
out from the track and up to this

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.270 
out from the track and up to this
position<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.350> I've<00:02:01.530> gone<00:02:01.710> out<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
position here so I've gone out from the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.600 
position here so I've gone out from the
level<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.579> track<00:02:02.969> two<00:02:03.270> blocks<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.460> I've

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
level of track two blocks and then I've

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.810 
level of track two blocks and then I've
gone<00:02:05.790> up

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
gone up

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.650 
gone up
to<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.940> fourth<00:02:08.210> block<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:10.210> there's<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.330> gas

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
to the fourth block and there's the gas

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.940 
to the fourth block and there's the gas
taking<00:02:12.140> damage<00:02:12.670> if<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.850> put<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.680> block<00:02:15.680> higher

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
taking damage if I put it a block higher

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.730 
taking damage if I put it a block higher
than<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.910> block<00:02:17.210> inside<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.320> like

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
than that or a block inside that like

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.940 
than that or a block inside that like
here<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.490> here<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:19.880> here<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.570> here<00:02:23.950> no

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
here and here and here and here no

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.020 
here and here and here and here no
damage<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:27.080> that's<00:02:28.070> kind<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.430> strange<00:02:28.670> I

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
damage so that's kind of strange I

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.790 
damage so that's kind of strange I
didn't<00:02:29.270> expect<00:02:29.630> that<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.960> all<00:02:31.450> so<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.410> could

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
didn't expect that at all so that could

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.560 
didn't expect that at all so that could
be<00:02:34.010> used<00:02:34.400> as<00:02:34.780> an<00:02:35.780> advantage<00:02:36.850> because<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:38.360> can

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
be used as an advantage because that can

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.930 
be used as an advantage because that can
help<00:02:38.780> with<00:02:39.110> separation<00:02:39.680> between<00:02:40.220> different

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
help with separation between different

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.480 
help with separation between different
types<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.330> mobs<00:02:41.570> if<00:02:41.840> you've<00:02:42.800> ever<00:02:42.920> seen<00:02:43.220> red

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
types of mobs if you've ever seen red

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.480 
types of mobs if you've ever seen red
eyes<00:02:43.780> set<00:02:44.780> up<00:02:44.900> where<00:02:45.170> he's<00:02:45.320> using<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:46.100> cart

would<00:03:26.480> suffocate<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.920> zombie<00:03:28.340> pigmen<00:03:28.760> but<00:03:29.600> it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
would suffocate the zombie pigmen but it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.449 
would suffocate the zombie pigmen but it
wouldn't<00:03:29.989> do<00:03:30.080> any<00:03:30.110> damage<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.800> gas<00:03:31.040> and

wouldn't do any damage to the gas and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.790 
wouldn't do any damage to the gas and
then<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.030> block<00:03:32.470> right<00:03:33.470> there<00:03:33.970> would<00:03:34.970> suffocate

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
then a block right there would suffocate

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.560 
then a block right there would suffocate
ghasts<00:03:36.800> but<00:03:37.400> obviously<00:03:37.880> wouldn't<00:03:38.180> do<00:03:38.420> any

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
ghasts but obviously wouldn't do any
