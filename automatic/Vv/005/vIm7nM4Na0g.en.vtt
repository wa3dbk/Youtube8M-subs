00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.130
 if you are a cinema you have not been yet 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.710
 but we also mentioned that people 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.680
 rip off and I wanted to know first 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.770

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.350
 big thing okay you have weird 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 interests well how often do you have 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.649
 people off so on average 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.750
 tell all the numbers 3 drift 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.100
 he has when I think times as you relish 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.810
 not that you like the whole game like that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 a bit too serious and with the people 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 Do not rip off because they have that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 all so earned and yet a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.590
 bit shit if you just to the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590
 take away 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.630
 moreover, himself always says 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 Deduction has no idea and they the 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.550
 Girls are two main people 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.580
 besides, you also do yourself 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.960
 videos as you said and how long 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.740
 would still play with the two 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.740
 make videos 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:58.430
 Maybe now means up to 80 ok 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.200
 then we all could do so now 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.940
 small picture of the make and can 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.350
 to estimate about 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.619
 then we come to the serious part now 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.150
 From now on I will alter egos this what 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.740
 he did piece for me against 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.130
 pick pieces apart and through 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.920
 show how ridiculous the boy is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.100
 Let's start with the description Jolo 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:27.650
 people so topic in the head little 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.650
 up saying and indeed he knows 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.209
 destines the dear master the little one 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.150
 love circle is in the small basin 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.560
 We summarize such good ones together 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.630
 I am the dear Mr. Tarek and I am 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.489
 a little fat German that says 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.180
 someone of me never in real 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.830
 has seen and no picture at all 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.360
 can make 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.240
 In addition , you claim at the end 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.580
 your video not because of German 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.050
 or something but have directly with so 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.460
 a shit in any case 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.980
 I have a few interviews from the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.690
 interviews his gay analyzes of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.640
 of course, theirs is also the foreign exchange 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.440
 not true 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.550
 only to skillfully rendered by 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.050
 The subscriptions are financed and the clicks through 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.230
 my name and brocken's name and that 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.700
 and in an interview with broken 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.860
 I have re-packed water from the beginning 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.470
 says so far okay my friend plays 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.430
 sensation game made like thousands 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.990
 Analyzes could be so extensive 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.500
 Analyzes about other players 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.200
 if only one player could do that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.990
 Really a lot about a ball but not 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.960
 I could not answer that yet 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.540
 I did not do the analysis and 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.640
 to get clicks but to the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.560
 Girls 2 community already fuller 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.080
 weak is aware of it once 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.850
 to make whom their heads in the hand 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.500
 press so they will not be ripped off 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.060
 because we always have such a hard time on the bag 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.950
 is that the good players stop 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.020
 because I am idiotic from anybody 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.380
 rip off because they just too much 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.480
 nice but those are all things again 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.799
 that you do not understand because you are ego 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.780
 player views and you all the people you 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.840
 Trust directly and immediately withdrew 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.180
 Alone you are not a team player 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.169
 you never know everything alone 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.650
 make a movie or a witch or dragon 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:33.810
 Some things online mirror are team games 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.540
 that's not you alone 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.490
 by that 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.760
 Well so far that was just the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.130
 in the beginning there is still much going on without 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.710
 Access mails turn now here 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.300
 receive breaking maximum sitting 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.810
 then no partners then not 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.330
 I could work so now 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.850
 together - architect video once 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.350
 gone through and I wonder where late 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.700
 I thought he wanted me with it 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.330
 get ready and you have one more left 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.010
 make learning about good videos quantity 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.680
 if that's a rap battle now 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.760
 I would not have any compare 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.980
 attack surface 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.470
 you have more than enough that I show 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.190
 you right now because you still you I 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.580
 Never need anything of your own 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.590
 have built up or thought so 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.940
 now it will be interesting for all those 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.850
 we know 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.680
 or just not because he is 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.770
 really never built something myself 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:40.310
 he calls himself eg grandfather 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:44.330
 Alter ego still concludes like rooney's 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.110
 or finally , and he himself 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.090
 none of this is what I am showing you now 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.910
 Let's start with the word you are not 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.310
 the boss colleague it the boss is simple 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.310

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.700
 I mean, there are kool savas 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.980

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:10.310
 why ever that you are the father 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:15.320
 eko fresh is the father and also older 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:18.860

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.590

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:30.230

 even the level 9 6 794 is the jihad 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.229

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:38.429
 I suddenly just compare poverty 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.549

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:44.579
 I would have been sexy opponents 

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:47.610

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.099
 brought together and tried the 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:56.339
 monotonically to save down 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:58.739
 but that does not fit and believes 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.389

00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:02.819
