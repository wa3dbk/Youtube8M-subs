00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
through like a lot of trauma and it's

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.949 
through like a lot of trauma and it's
really<00:03:47.190> calmed<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.940> skin<00:03:48.209> down<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.720> it's

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
really calmed this skin down and it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.920 
really calmed this skin down and it's
nourishing<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.890> it's<00:03:50.489> pumping<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.510> area

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
