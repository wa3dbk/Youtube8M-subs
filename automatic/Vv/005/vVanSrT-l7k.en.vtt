00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.030 
there's always a different monsters and
stuff<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:46.989> pretty<00:02:47.230> sweet<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.859> never

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
stuff so it's pretty sweet so never

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.860 
stuff so it's pretty sweet so never
really<00:02:48.220> gets<00:02:48.430> what's<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.299> predator<00:02:49.660> because

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
really gets what's the predator because

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.569 
really gets what's the predator because
you<00:02:49.959> do<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.170> same<00:02:50.350> thing<00:02:50.530> every<00:02:50.680> time<00:02:50.739> but<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
you do the same thing every time but the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.229 
you do the same thing every time but the
level<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.910> always<00:02:52.150> different<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:55.090> this

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
level is always different I think this

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.099 
level is always different I think this
is<00:02:55.299> actually<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:57.579> type<00:02:57.790> one<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.030> was<00:02:58.299> um<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.870> got

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
is actually the type one I was um I got

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:10.330 
is actually the type one I was um I got
my<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.859> good<00:03:00.010> score

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
