00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
because I am pretty frustrated in case

because I am pretty frustrated in case

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
last three hours and I'm kind of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
last three hours and I'm kind of
embarrassed<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.510> admit<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
embarrassed to admit that but for the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.770 
embarrassed to admit that but for the
last<00:00:43.950> three<00:00:44.219> hours<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.760> been<00:00:45.059> playing<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
last three hours I have been playing the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420 
last three hours I have been playing the
game<00:00:45.960> trying<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> million<00:00:46.950> dollars

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
game trying to get the million dollars

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
game trying to get the million dollars
and<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> hot<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and it's not been going to hot the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.200 
and it's not been going to hot the
farthest<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.010> I've<00:00:50.100> gotten<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> sixth

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
farthest that I've gotten is the sixth

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
farthest that I've gotten is the sixth
inning<00:00:51.980> now<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.520> MLB<00:00:53.969> 2k11<00:00:54.390> pitching<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
inning now with MLB 2k11 pitching is a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.380 
inning now with MLB 2k11 pitching is a
lot<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:55.770> difficult<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.789> last<00:00:56.820> year

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
lot more difficult than it was last year

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.729 
lot more difficult than it was last year
so<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.140> part<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> what's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so I think that's part of what's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.420 
so I think that's part of what's
contributing<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> seems<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:01.430> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
contributing to it seems like the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.030 
contributing to it seems like the
hitters<00:01:02.910> definitely<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.480> an<00:01:03.570> advantage

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
hitters definitely have an advantage

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
hitters definitely have an advantage
because<00:01:05.040> there's<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.700> many<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.299> loops

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
because there's so many little loops

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.980 
because there's so many little loops
like<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.909> just<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.840> in

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
like that one there that just get in

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.940 
like that one there that just get in
there<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:10.409> nothing<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.830> really

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
there and there's nothing you can really

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
there and there's nothing you can really
do<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.000> mean<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> course<00:01:12.390> makes

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
do about it which I mean of course makes

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.170 
do about it which I mean of course makes
sense<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.369> there's<00:01:14.369> been<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> whole<00:01:14.880> bunch<00:01:15.060> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
sense but there's been a whole bunch of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.380 
sense but there's been a whole bunch of
things<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.740> frustrate<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> I'm

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
things that really frustrate me and I'm

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
things that really frustrate me and I'm
making<00:01:18.600> me<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.290> thing's<00:01:19.530> rigged<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
making me think this thing's rigged a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.830 
making me think this thing's rigged a
little<00:01:20.189> bit<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.090> can't<00:01:21.299> tell<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.600> how

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
little bit because I can't tell you how

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
little bit because I can't tell you how
many<00:01:21.900> plays<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.909> third<00:01:24.150> base

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
many plays that go up the third base

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
many plays that go up the third base
line<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.140> been<00:01:25.200> absolutely<00:01:25.380> no

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
line that would have been absolutely no

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
line that would have been absolutely no
problem<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> third<00:01:26.610> baseman<00:01:26.930> had<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
problem for the third baseman had the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
problem for the third baseman had the
computer<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.770> had<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> third<00:01:29.369> baseman<00:01:29.610> turn

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
computer not had the third baseman turn

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.440 
computer not had the third baseman turn
in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> wrong<00:01:31.110> direction<00:01:31.430> like<00:01:32.430> say<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.360> on

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in the wrong direction like say it's on

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.170 
in the wrong direction like say it's on
his<00:01:33.630> right<00:01:33.869> side<00:01:34.369> well<00:01:35.369> he<00:01:35.579> turns<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> left

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
his right side well he turns to the left

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.080 
his right side well he turns to the left
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.070> whizzes<00:01:38.369> by<00:01:38.549> him<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> then

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and then it just whizzes by him and then

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
and then it just whizzes by him and then
he<00:01:39.180> turns<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.860> seems<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
he turns around so there seems to be a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.859 
he turns around so there seems to be a
lot<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.670> glitches<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> its<00:01:42.780> really

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
lot of glitches in this and its really

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.300 
lot of glitches in this and its really
frustrating<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.890> seems<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> be

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
frustrating me and it seems to be

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.510

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.430 
me want to be Johnson right now too and
this<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.340> kind<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.670> weird<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.240> each<00:02:30.900> game<00:02:31.200> right

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this is kind of weird is each game right

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.970 
this is kind of weird is each game right
now<00:02:31.470> has<00:02:31.860> different<00:02:32.310> camera<00:02:32.670> angles<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
now has different camera angles so you

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.920 
now has different camera angles so you
go<00:02:35.130> into<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.580> game<00:02:35.820> like<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.360> played<00:02:36.630> as<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
go into one game like I played as the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.130 
go into one game like I played as the
A's<00:02:37.560> against<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.700> Mariners<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:41.220> A's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
A's against the Mariners and the A's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.420 
A's against the Mariners and the A's
camera<00:02:43.140> angle<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> lot<00:02:43.830> different<00:02:43.980> than<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
camera angle is a lot different than the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
camera angle is a lot different than the
one<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.790> Marlins<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> Mets<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.950> I

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
one with the Marlins and the Mets so I

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.800 
one with the Marlins and the Mets so I
don't<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.120> that's<00:02:48.330> been<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.630> of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
don't know that's been kind of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.120 
don't know that's been kind of
frustrating<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.590> don't

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
know I'd kind of I mean I understand why

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.979

ridiculous and I think a lot of people

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.520 
ridiculous and I think a lot of people

thinking of posting a fake i won just to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.070 
thinking of posting a fake i won just to
see<00:03:06.000> if<00:03:06.120> that'll<00:03:06.300> make<00:03:06.390> some<00:03:06.690> more<00:03:06.780> people

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080

I<00:03:10.380> don't<00:03:10.680> know<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.920> probably<00:03:11.130> won't<00:03:11.310> do<00:03:11.459> that

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
I don't know I probably won't do that

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.150 
I don't know I probably won't do that
because<00:03:11.670> that's<00:03:11.850> dishonest<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:13.040> shouldn't<00:03:14.040> do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
because that's dishonest I shouldn't do

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.570 
because that's dishonest I shouldn't do
that<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> thing<00:03:15.209> that's<00:03:15.980> about<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.250> too

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
that but the thing that's about this too

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.340 
that but the thing that's about this too
is<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:20.370> very<00:03:20.820> very<00:03:21.360> easy<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.900> get<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.079> video

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
is it is very very easy to get a video

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.990 
is it is very very easy to get a video
disqualified<00:03:23.160> because<00:03:23.310> one<00:03:23.549> thing<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
disqualified because one thing that you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.610 
disqualified because one thing that you
have<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.870> record<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.319 

it<00:03:28.620> has<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.920> be<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.370> certain<00:03:29.519> quality<00:03:29.880> like

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
it has to be of a certain quality like

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.910 
it has to be of a certain quality like
it<00:03:30.510> has<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.780> be<00:03:30.870> able<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.110> read<00:03:31.290> certain<00:03:31.560> things

it has to be able to read certain things

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
it has to be able to read certain things
and<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.209> been<00:03:33.390> kind<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.720> difficult

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and so that's been kind of difficult

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.750 
and so that's been kind of difficult
because<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.440> lot<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.739> people<00:03:34.860> with<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.579> whole

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
because a lot of people with a whole

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.930 
because a lot of people with a whole
bunch<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:36.120> recording<00:03:36.810> devices<00:03:37.519> are<00:03:38.519> having<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
bunch of recording devices are having a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
bunch of recording devices are having a
hard<00:03:39.120> time<00:03:39.180> with<00:03:39.480> that<00:03:39.510> because<00:03:39.780> one<00:03:40.170> screen

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
hard time with that because one screen

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.770 
hard time with that because one screen
it's<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.100> white<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.670> has<00:03:41.820> grey<00:03:42.150> text<00:03:42.630> and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
it's like white and has grey text and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.229 
it's like white and has grey text and
the<00:03:43.440> white<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.920> TV<00:03:44.430> definitely

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
the white of the TV definitely

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.060 
the white of the TV definitely
overpowers<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.290> grain<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:46.860> very

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
overpowers the grain so it's very

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.210 
overpowers the grain so it's very
difficult<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:48.170> I've<00:03:49.170> been<00:03:49.440> actually

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
difficult to see I've been actually

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.440 
difficult to see I've been actually
making<00:03:50.400> some<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.970> friends<00:03:51.150> mad

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
making some of my friends mad

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.140 
making some of my friends mad
because<00:03:53.450> one<00:03:54.439> of<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.739> things<00:03:54.769> too<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.340> you

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
because one of the things too is you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.899 
because one of the things too is you
have<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.510> record<00:03:56.870> your<00:03:57.110> xbox<00:03:57.650> starting<00:03:58.159> out<00:03:58.280> so

field I was so surprised that I got this
hit<00:05:52.070> over<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:52.909> wall<00:05:53.300> because<00:05:54.139> i<00:05:54.320> don't<00:05:54.470> think

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
hit over the wall because i don't think

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.980 
hit over the wall because i don't think
i've<00:05:54.740> ever<00:05:54.770> gotten<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.490> home

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
i've ever gotten a home

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.180 
i've ever gotten a home
and<00:05:56.110> in<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.770> minor<00:05:56.980> leaks<00:05:57.370> like<00:05:57.850> an<00:05:58.000> MLB<00:05:58.420> 2k10

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
and in the minor leaks like an MLB 2k10

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.250 
and in the minor leaks like an MLB 2k10
especially<00:06:00.190> here<00:06:00.340> in<00:06:00.370> 2k11<00:06:00.790> that<00:06:01.660> is<00:06:01.810> my<00:06:01.960> first

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
especially here in 2k11 that is my first

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.410 
especially here in 2k11 that is my first
professional<00:06:02.470> home<00:06:03.070> run<00:06:03.310> that's<00:06:03.880> awesome

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
professional home run that's awesome

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.030 
professional home run that's awesome
because<00:06:04.570> I<00:06:04.720> have<00:06:04.990> some<00:06:05.230> more<00:06:05.350> skill<00:06:05.650> points

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
because I have some more skill points

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.390 
because I have some more skill points
now<00:06:06.190> because<00:06:06.700> of<00:06:06.880> that<00:06:07.030> home<00:06:07.210> run<00:06:07.530> so<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:08.890> was

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
now because of that home run so I was

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.100 
now because of that home run so I was
surprised<00:06:09.730> but<00:06:10.030> one<00:06:10.510> of<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.690> things<00:06:10.750> too<00:06:11.080> is

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
surprised but one of the things too is

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.630 
surprised but one of the things too is
you<00:06:11.320> look<00:06:11.470> at<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.770> measurements<00:06:12.250> on<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.460> wall

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
you look at the measurements on the wall

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.360 
you look at the measurements on the wall
you<00:06:12.790> can<00:06:12.940> see<00:06:13.180> that<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:14.050> wall<00:06:14.230> is<00:06:14.260> a<00:06:14.770> lot<00:06:15.130> more

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
you can see that the wall is a lot more

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.770 
you can see that the wall is a lot more
closer<00:06:15.670> and<00:06:15.970> than<00:06:16.120> what<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.300> typically<00:06:16.690> see

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
closer and than what you typically see

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.170 
closer and than what you typically see
in<00:06:17.260> a<00:06:17.800> major<00:06:17.980> league<00:06:18.220> ballpark<00:06:18.700> but<00:06:18.880> the<00:06:18.940> walls

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
in a major league ballpark but the walls

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.690 
in a major league ballpark but the walls
higher<00:06:19.360> so<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:19.660> guess<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:19.960> balances<00:06:20.080> out<00:06:20.700> either

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
higher so I guess it balances out either

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.300 
higher so I guess it balances out either
way<00:06:21.820> though<00:06:22.030> that<00:06:22.720> is<00:06:22.900> a<00:06:22.930> home<00:06:23.200> run<00:06:23.440> and<00:06:23.830> had

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
way though that is a home run and had

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.770 
way though that is a home run and had
his<00:06:24.460> skill<00:06:24.730> points<00:06:25.060> for<00:06:25.210> me<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.450> build<00:06:25.570> myself

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
his skill points for me to build myself

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.500 
his skill points for me to build myself
up<00:06:26.170> with<00:06:26.410> so<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.400> was<00:06:27.550> a<00:06:27.580> big<00:06:27.850> hit<00:06:28.090> for<00:06:28.330> me

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
up with so that was a big hit for me

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.450 
up with so that was a big hit for me
like<00:06:29.230> I<00:06:29.320> said<00:06:29.380> I<00:06:29.530> was<00:06:29.650> really<00:06:29.950> surprised<00:06:30.340> that
