right here by this glowstone lamp and it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
right here by this glowstone lamp and it
couldn't<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.910> simpler<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.690> just

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
that rule number two is that there is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.010

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
three only if you have any more then

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.070 
three only if you have any more then
you're<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.970> disqualified<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
you're going to be disqualified the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.200 
you're going to be disqualified the
reason<00:02:28.590> we're<00:02:28.710> keeping<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.220> down<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.610> three<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
reason we're keeping it down to three is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.330 
reason we're keeping it down to three is
we<00:02:30.720> need<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.990> keep<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.290> flowing<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.980> six

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we need to keep this flowing and six

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.750 
we need to keep this flowing and six
pokémon<00:02:32.610> could<00:02:33.150> take<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> very<00:02:33.870> very<00:02:33.990> long<00:02:34.470> time

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
pokémon could take a very very long time

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.060 
pokémon could take a very very long time
so<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.510> rule<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.500> rule<00:02:37.770> so

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
so that's that rule and on that rule so

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.370 
so that's that rule and on that rule so
rule<00:02:38.250> number<00:02:38.280> three<00:02:38.790> level<00:02:39.360> 100<00:02:39.780> max<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.260> were

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
rule number three level 100 max we were

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.010 
rule number three level 100 max we were
gonna<00:02:40.560> do<00:02:40.770> 70<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.030> realized<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.690> some

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
gonna do 70 but we realized that is some

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.290 
gonna do 70 but we realized that is some
people<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:44.100> forget<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> click<00:02:44.820> their<00:02:45.090> little

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300

level cap or whatever some people just

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.580 
level cap or whatever some people just
go<00:02:48.000> over<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> then<00:02:48.570> they<00:02:48.690> can't<00:02:48.930> enter<00:02:49.440> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
go over and then they can't enter and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.020 
go over and then they can't enter and
they'll<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.800> disqualified<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.850> not

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
they'll be disqualified and it's not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
they'll be disqualified and it's not
very<00:02:51.060> fair<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> level

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
very fair so if we just do a level

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
very fair so if we just do a level
hundred<00:02:53.010> max<00:02:53.220> then<00:02:53.610> pretty<00:02:53.910> much<00:02:54.000> anyone<00:02:54.600> can
