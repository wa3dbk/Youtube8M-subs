under<00:01:12.860> motor<00:01:13.250> power<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.910> we<00:01:14.299> do<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:14.960> that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
under motor power and we do that so that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.289 
under motor power and we do that so that
it's<00:01:15.260> not<00:01:15.530> regulated<00:01:16.280> as<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.430> motor<00:01:16.700> vehicle<00:01:16.790> in

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
miles of range with normal pedaling you

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.630 
miles of range with normal pedaling you
can<00:01:23.840> also<00:01:23.990> get<00:01:24.260> an<00:01:24.409> extended<00:01:24.979> battery<00:01:25.130> pack

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
can also get an extended battery pack

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.520 
can also get an extended battery pack
which<00:01:26.240> will<00:01:26.420> give<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:26.659> fifty<00:01:26.990> percent<00:01:27.290> more

miles<00:01:30.170> per<00:01:30.890> charge<00:01:30.920> on<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:31.640> bike<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:32.180> know

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
miles per charge on this bike I know

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.600 
miles per charge on this bike I know
that<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:33.350> said<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.950> interesting<00:01:34.460> thing

that you said that the interesting thing
about<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.939> white<00:01:35.150> was<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.540> battery

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
about this white was the battery

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.870 
about this white was the battery
placement<00:01:36.560> rate<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:36.920> once<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.189> tell<00:01:37.369> what

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
placement rate here once you tell what

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.300 
placement rate here once you tell what
makes<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.270> unique<00:01:38.659> at<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.049> bike<00:01:39.290> sure<00:01:39.799> so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
makes that unique at this bike sure so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.920 
makes that unique at this bike sure so
then<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.850> great<00:01:41.090> thing<00:01:41.270> about<00:01:41.360> this<00:01:41.509> bike<00:01:41.900> is

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
then the great thing about this bike is

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.499 
then the great thing about this bike is
because<00:01:42.530> we<00:01:42.710> put<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.070> battery<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.729> line<00:01:44.240> with

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
because we put the battery in line with

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.810 
because we put the battery in line with
the<00:01:44.630> riders<00:01:45.049> core<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.710> seat<00:01:45.920> post<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
the riders core in the seat post the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.999 
the riders core in the seat post the
extra<00:01:47.270> weight<00:01:47.360> literally<00:01:47.930> disappears<00:01:48.680> any

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
extra weight literally disappears any

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.069 
extra weight literally disappears any
other<00:01:49.610> place<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.210> put<00:01:50.420> extra<00:01:50.689> weight<00:01:50.930> on

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
other place that you put extra weight on

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.899

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
a bike changes the handling dynamics

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.179 
a bike changes the handling dynamics
pretty<00:01:53.540> significantly<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.560> bike<00:01:55.159> is

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
pretty significantly and this bike is

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.880 
pretty significantly and this bike is

very unique and patented because of the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.300 
very unique and patented because of the
battery<00:01:58.250> placement<00:01:58.939> I<00:01:59.710> know<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:01.100> this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
battery placement I know you have this
