00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.039 
homeless our veterans fifth ground to me
is<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:44.210> even<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> homeless<00:01:45.570> safe

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
is not just about even the homeless safe

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.679 
is not just about even the homeless safe
it's<00:01:46.409> about

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
it's about

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.870 
it's about
trying<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.680> make<00:01:48.799> it<00:01:48.950> safe<00:01:49.220> through<00:01:49.520> all<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
trying to make it safe through all the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.960 
trying to make it safe through all the
restless<00:01:50.299> citizens<00:01:50.780> -<00:01:51.369> how<00:01:52.369> many<00:01:52.549> things<00:01:52.790> all

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
restless citizens - how many things all

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.179 
restless citizens - how many things all
over<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.360> street<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.200> everywhere<00:01:54.799> else<00:01:54.830> it's

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
over the street and everywhere else it's

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:01.480 
over the street and everywhere else it's
not<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.369> safe<00:01:55.610> condition<00:01:58.270> by<00:01:59.270> having<00:02:00.490> no

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
not a safe condition by having no

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.950 
not a safe condition by having no
sanitation<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:02.600> not<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> safe<00:02:03.229> condition

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
sanitation that's not a safe condition

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.330 
sanitation that's not a safe condition
so<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:07.119> think<00:02:08.119> it's<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.810> very<00:02:09.110> good<00:02:09.380> idea<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.860> try
