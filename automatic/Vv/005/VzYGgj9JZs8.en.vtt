department today we're going to talk
about<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> Earth's<00:00:07.200> oceans

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about the Earth's oceans

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.430 
about the Earth's oceans
now<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.700> Earth's<00:00:08.910> oceans<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.480> such<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> vast

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
now the Earth's oceans are such a vast

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.530 
now the Earth's oceans are such a vast
feature<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.610> planet<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:12.269> actually

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
feature here on the planet they actually

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.289 
feature here on the planet they actually
cover<00:00:12.719> about<00:00:12.900> 75%<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.040> so<00:00:14.460> 75%<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.210> our

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
cover about 75% of it so 75% of our

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.680 
cover about 75% of it so 75% of our
earth<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.719> covered<00:00:15.750> by<00:00:16.080> salt<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:16.710> saline<00:00:17.130> water

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
earth is covered by salt or saline water

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.970 
earth is covered by salt or saline water
most<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> change<00:00:19.140> within<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> oceans<00:00:19.830> can

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
most of the change within the oceans can

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010 
most of the change within the oceans can
be<00:00:20.100> found<00:00:20.369> right<00:00:21.000> along<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> shoreline<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
be found right along the shoreline and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.240 
be found right along the shoreline and
we'll<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.650> limit<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> change

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
we'll get into the limit of that change

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.189 
we'll get into the limit of that change
a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.460> bit<00:00:23.640> later<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.090> let's<00:00:24.900> start<00:00:25.080> out

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
a little bit later on let's start out

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.480 
a little bit later on let's start out
with<00:00:25.230> actually<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> topography<00:00:26.279> that's

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with actually the topography that's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
with actually the topography that's
underwater<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> good<00:00:28.170> portion<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
underwater you have a good portion of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.839 
underwater you have a good portion of
the<00:00:28.680> continent<00:00:29.099> underwater<00:00:29.519> called<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the continent underwater called the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.060 
the continent underwater called the
content<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.330> shelf<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.590> give<00:00:31.800> way<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
content of shelf that will give way to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
content of shelf that will give way to
the<00:00:32.309> continental<00:00:32.940> slope<00:00:33.020> which<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the continental slope which is kind of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
the continental slope which is kind of
the<00:00:34.559> end<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> content<00:00:35.460> underwater<00:00:35.910> which

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the end of the content underwater which

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840 
the end of the content underwater which
gives<00:00:36.660> rise<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> abyssal<00:00:37.649> plain<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.700> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
gives rise to the abyssal plain which is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
gives rise to the abyssal plain which is
the<00:00:38.940> beginning<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.750> deep<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.260> section

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the beginning of the deep water section

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
the beginning of the deep water section
of<00:00:41.010> our<00:00:41.129> oceans<00:00:41.550> now<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> abyssal<00:00:42.780> plain

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
of our oceans now on the abyssal plain

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
of our oceans now on the abyssal plain
you<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.530> features<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.070> have<00:00:44.100> trenches

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you have some features you have trenches

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.660 
you have some features you have trenches
you<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.210> ridges<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.379> Islands<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you have ridges you have Islands you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
you have ridges you have Islands you
have<00:00:47.789> underwater<00:00:48.360> mountains<00:00:48.840> called<00:00:49.050> sea

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
have underwater mountains called sea

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
have underwater mountains called sea
mounts<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.309> underwater<00:00:50.700> mountains

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
mounts you have underwater mountains

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.389 
mounts you have underwater mountains
that<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.420> flat<00:00:51.660> tops<00:00:51.930> called<00:00:52.230> diodes<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
that are flat tops called diodes so you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
that are flat tops called diodes so you
have<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> significant<00:00:54.300> number<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> features

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
have a significant number of features

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
have a significant number of features
that<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.289> be<00:00:55.320> found<00:00:55.559> along<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> ocean<00:00:56.370> bottom

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that can be found along the ocean bottom

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
that can be found along the ocean bottom
notice<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.449> ocean<00:00:57.629> bottom<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.960> not

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
notice that the ocean bottom is not

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.369 
notice that the ocean bottom is not
completely<00:00:58.530> flat<00:00:59.570> now<00:01:00.570> there<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> number

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
completely flat now there are a number

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
completely flat now there are a number
of<00:01:01.890> parts<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.030> need<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.449> idea

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of parts that you need to have an idea

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.539 
of parts that you need to have an idea
about<00:01:03.899> regarding<00:01:04.409> waves<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> have

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
about regarding waves and if you have

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.160 
about regarding waves and if you have
any<00:01:05.850> recollection<00:01:06.540> about<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
any recollection about the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
any recollection about the
electromagnetic<00:01:07.619> spectrum<00:01:08.220> those<00:01:09.180> same

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
electromagnetic spectrum those same

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
electromagnetic spectrum those same
features<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.020> applied<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> ocean<00:01:10.890> waves

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
features would be applied to ocean waves

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.820 
features would be applied to ocean waves
as<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> includes<00:01:12.390> wavelength<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
as well and that includes wavelength the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
as well and that includes wavelength the
crest<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.310> wave<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.909> trough<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> wave

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
crest of the wave the trough of the wave

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.109 
crest of the wave the trough of the wave
and<00:01:15.810> also<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> amplitude<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> wave<00:01:17.820> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and also the amplitude of the wave so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.060 
and also the amplitude of the wave so
make<00:01:18.900> sure<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.409> idea<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.740> terms<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
make sure you have an idea in terms of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
make sure you have an idea in terms of
different<00:01:20.369> characteristics<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.720> waves

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
different characteristics of the waves

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
different characteristics of the waves
themselves<00:01:22.790> now<00:01:23.790> waves<00:01:24.119> themselves<00:01:24.750> are

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
themselves now waves themselves are

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
themselves now waves themselves are
important<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.470> they're<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> main

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
important because they're the main

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
important because they're the main
reason<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.330> changing<00:01:27.720> shoreline<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
reason for the changing shoreline and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
reason for the changing shoreline and
waves<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.340> created<00:01:29.729> by<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> circular

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
waves are can be created by the circular

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.120 
waves are can be created by the circular
pattern<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> water<00:01:31.200> molecules<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
pattern of the water molecules the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.590 
pattern of the water molecules the
bigger<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> circular<00:01:32.850> pattern<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.390> bigger

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
bigger the circular pattern the bigger

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.450 
bigger the circular pattern the bigger
the<00:01:33.720> wave<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.799> essentially

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the wave is going to be and essentially

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.039 
the wave is going to be and essentially
that's<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> associated<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:36.750> wind

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's going to be associated with wind

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.870 
that's going to be associated with wind
speed<00:01:37.320> we'll<00:01:37.860> talk<00:01:38.040> about<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> relationship

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
speed we'll talk about the relationship

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.390 
speed we'll talk about the relationship
between<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.390> coming<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:40.310> there's<00:01:41.310> your

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
between the two coming up there's your

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
between the two coming up there's your
circular<00:01:41.880> pattern<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:43.170> water<00:01:43.439> molecules

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
circular pattern of your water molecules

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.600 
circular pattern of your water molecules
creating<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.399> waves<00:01:46.070> now<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.430> are<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
creating your waves now there are a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190 
creating your waves now there are a
couple<00:01:47.820> factors<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
couple factors here that are going to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
couple factors here that are going to
determine<00:01:49.470> wave<00:01:49.770> height<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.280> first<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
determine wave height and the first and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
determine wave height and the first and
number<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.390> reason<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.560> greater<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
number one reason is the greater the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.740 
number one reason is the greater the
wind<00:01:53.130> speed<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.399> bigger<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> wave<00:01:54.030> there's<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
wind speed the bigger the wave there's a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.109 
wind speed the bigger the wave there's a
tremendous<00:01:55.170> amount<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.439> friction<00:01:55.829> between

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
tremendous amount of friction between

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.850 
tremendous amount of friction between
wind<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> water<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.409> more<00:01:58.590> friction

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
wind and water and the more friction

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
wind and water and the more friction
that<00:01:59.040> there<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.000> energies<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.570> be

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
that there is the more energies can be

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
that there is the more energies can be
transferred<00:02:01.110> from<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> moving<00:02:01.680> air<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
transferred from the moving air to the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.980 
transferred from the moving air to the
moving<00:02:02.520> water<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.329> bigger<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> wave<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
moving water the bigger the wave is

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
moving water the bigger the wave is
actually<00:02:04.320> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:05.369> also<00:02:05.520> want<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
actually going to be we also want to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.399 
actually going to be we also want to
measure<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.600> long<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> winds<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.320> been

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
measure how long the winds have been

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.779 
measure how long the winds have been
blowing<00:02:07.619> across<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> water<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
blowing across the water and the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
blowing across the water and the
distance<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.509> been<00:02:09.720> blown

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
distance it's been blown

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.610 
distance it's been blown
the<00:02:10.979> distance<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.549> what<00:02:11.700> we<00:02:11.790> call<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.060> fetch

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the distance is what we call the fetch

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.839 
the distance is what we call the fetch
so<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:13.829> how<00:02:13.980> big<00:02:14.219> some<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.459> these<00:02:14.579> waves

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
so you see how big some of these waves

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.339 
so you see how big some of these waves
actually<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:17.209> now<00:02:18.209> waves<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:19.170> going<00:02:19.290> to

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
actually can get now waves are going to

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.809 
actually can get now waves are going to
carry<00:02:19.560> sediments<00:02:20.159> that's<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.549> we<00:02:20.609> call

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
carry sediments that's what we call

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.809 
carry sediments that's what we call
longshore<00:02:21.299> drift<00:02:21.329> or<00:02:21.810> longshore<00:02:22.349> currents

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
longshore drift or longshore currents

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.709 
longshore drift or longshore currents
longshore<00:02:23.819> currents<00:02:24.239> are<00:02:24.329> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> carry

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
longshore currents are going to carry

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.809 
longshore currents are going to carry
sediment<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.499> the<00:02:25.620> beaches<00:02:26.010> they're<00:02:26.639> going<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
sediment to the beaches they're going to

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.569 
sediment to the beaches they're going to
travel<00:02:27.000> parallel<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.780> shoreline<00:02:27.989> and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
travel parallel to the shoreline and

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.860 
travel parallel to the shoreline and
deposit<00:02:29.579> sediment<00:02:29.819> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> beach<00:02:30.510> itself

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
deposit sediment on the beach itself

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.229 
deposit sediment on the beach itself
which<00:02:31.379> will<00:02:31.530> basically<00:02:32.010> make<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> beach<00:02:32.969> get

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
which will basically make the beach get

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.599 
which will basically make the beach get
bigger<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:34.439> you<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.620> see<00:02:34.739> how<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:34.980> longshore

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
bigger so you can see how the longshore

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.550 
bigger so you can see how the longshore
current<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.419> going<00:02:36.659> to<00:02:36.719> carry<00:02:36.930> their<00:02:37.109> sediment

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
current is going to carry their sediment

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.979 
current is going to carry their sediment
to<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.250> beach<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.000> sediment<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.780> going

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
to the beach and that sediment is going

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.530 
to the beach and that sediment is going
to<00:02:40.049> be<00:02:40.139> deposited<00:02:40.439> on<00:02:40.889> the<00:02:40.980> beach<00:02:41.389> now<00:02:42.389> there

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
to be deposited on the beach now there

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.270 
to be deposited on the beach now there
are<00:02:42.659> some<00:02:42.870> manmade<00:02:43.200> structures<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:44.219> are

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
are some manmade structures that are

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.589 
are some manmade structures that are
going<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.549> be<00:02:44.639> put<00:02:44.879> out<00:02:44.909> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> water<00:02:45.359> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
going to be put out in the water to

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.780 
going to be put out in the water to
disrupt<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.200> longshore<00:02:46.709> current<00:02:47.159> these

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
disrupt this longshore current these

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.129 
disrupt this longshore current these
structures<00:02:48.329> are<00:02:48.449> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.629> reduce<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
structures are going to reduce the

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.809 
structures are going to reduce the
amount<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.349> erosion<00:02:49.859> going<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.669> also

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
amount of erosion going on but also

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.479 
amount of erosion going on but also
stimulate<00:02:51.480> deposition<00:02:52.219> and<00:02:53.219> they're<00:02:53.400> going

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
stimulate deposition and they're going

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.059 
stimulate deposition and they're going
to<00:02:53.579> include<00:02:53.760> jetties<00:02:54.299> joins<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.379> breakwaters

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
to include jetties joins and breakwaters

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.339 
to include jetties joins and breakwaters
let's<00:02:56.549> take<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> look<00:02:56.969> at<00:02:57.060> them<00:02:57.319> jetties<00:02:58.319> can

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
let's take a look at them jetties can

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.319 
let's take a look at them jetties can
either<00:02:58.889> be<00:02:59.069> rock<00:02:59.340> walls<00:02:59.639> going<00:02:59.969> out<00:03:00.090> into<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
either be rock walls going out into the

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.209 
either be rock walls going out into the
water<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.930> disrupt<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.409> longshore<00:03:01.829> current

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
water to disrupt the longshore current

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.129 
water to disrupt the longshore current
or<00:03:02.340> they're<00:03:03.090> going<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.359> wooden<00:03:03.719> walls<00:03:03.930> as

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
or they're going to be wooden walls as

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.360 
or they're going to be wooden walls as
well<00:03:04.349> you're<00:03:04.620> both<00:03:04.799> gonna<00:03:05.040> stimulate

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
well you're both gonna stimulate

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.119 
well you're both gonna stimulate
deposition<00:03:06.209> groins<00:03:07.139> are<00:03:07.680> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> be

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
deposition groins are going to be

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.550 
deposition groins are going to be
slotted<00:03:08.459> fences<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.599> are<00:03:09.750> going<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.199> allow

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
slotted fences that are going to allow

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.379 
slotted fences that are going to allow
wind<00:03:10.949> to<00:03:11.069> pass<00:03:11.250> through<00:03:11.579> but<00:03:12.060> they're<00:03:12.209> going

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
wind to pass through but they're going

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.420 
wind to pass through but they're going
to<00:03:12.480> limit<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.870> carrying<00:03:13.260> power<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.829> also

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
to limit the carrying power and also

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.229 
to limit the carrying power and also
reduce<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.819> amount<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.659> dune<00:03:16.259> migration<00:03:16.979> and

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
reduce the amount of dune migration and

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.729 
reduce the amount of dune migration and
then<00:03:18.239> finally<00:03:18.540> breakwaters<00:03:19.079> breakwaters<00:03:19.650> are

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
then finally breakwaters breakwaters are

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.199 
then finally breakwaters breakwaters are
big<00:03:20.040> walls<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.549> are<00:03:20.669> put<00:03:20.849> out<00:03:20.879> into<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
big walls that are put out into the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.089 
big walls that are put out into the
water<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.930> allow<00:03:22.049> waves<00:03:22.409> to<00:03:22.590> crash<00:03:22.859> into

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
water to allow waves to crash into

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.499 
water to allow waves to crash into
they're<00:03:23.699> going<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.909> lose<00:03:24.000> their<00:03:24.180> carrying

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:24.509 
they're going to lose their carrying

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.689 
they're going to lose their carrying
power<00:03:24.689> which<00:03:25.229> is<00:03:25.349> going<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.560> basically<00:03:26.280> lead

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
power which is going to basically lead

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.939 
power which is going to basically lead
to<00:03:26.879> deposition<00:03:27.599> on<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.379> beaches

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
to deposition on the beaches

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.949 
to deposition on the beaches
so<00:03:29.400> there's<00:03:29.579> your<00:03:29.699> breakwaters<00:03:30.239> there<00:03:32.959> that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
so there's your breakwaters there that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.539 
so there's your breakwaters there that
leads<00:03:34.169> us<00:03:34.319> to<00:03:34.349> basically<00:03:34.949> the<00:03:35.009> purpose<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.489> a

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
leads us to basically the purpose of a

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.420 
leads us to basically the purpose of a
jetty<00:03:35.790> okay<00:03:36.780> your<00:03:37.049> jetties<00:03:37.439> again<00:03:37.889> are<00:03:38.069> going

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
jetty okay your jetties again are going

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.520 
jetty okay your jetties again are going
to<00:03:38.579> basically<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.359> going<00:03:40.079> to<00:03:40.169> be<00:03:40.229> put<00:03:40.409> out<00:03:40.500> in

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
to basically be going to be put out in

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.429 
to basically be going to be put out in
water<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.340> stimulate<00:03:41.759> deposition<00:03:42.389> so<00:03:43.079> one

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
water to stimulate deposition so one

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.809 
water to stimulate deposition so one
side<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.859> your<00:03:43.919> jetty<00:03:44.189> you're<00:03:44.519> going<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.699> get

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
side of your jetty you're going to get

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.759 
side of your jetty you're going to get
deposition<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.959> other<00:03:46.109> side<00:03:46.379> the<00:03:46.530> jetty

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
deposition the other side the jetty

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.339 
deposition the other side the jetty
you're<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.519> get<00:03:47.729> a<00:03:48.109> little<00:03:49.109> bit<00:03:49.259> of

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
you're going to get a little bit of

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.039 
you're going to get a little bit of
erosion<00:03:49.650> now<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> side<00:03:50.759> of<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> jetty<00:03:51.419> that's

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
erosion now the side of the jetty that's

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.140 
erosion now the side of the jetty that's
going<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.530> get<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.829> position<00:03:53.009> that's<00:03:53.879> the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
going to get that position that's the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.369 
going to get that position that's the
side<00:03:54.389> that's<00:03:54.599> going<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.810> tell<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.049> where<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
side that's going to tell you where the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.229 
side that's going to tell you where the
waves<00:03:55.560> are<00:03:55.739> coming<00:03:55.859> from<00:03:56.189> so<00:03:56.969> if<00:03:57.120> you're

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
waves are coming from so if you're

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.969 
waves are coming from so if you're
looking<00:03:57.359> at<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.629> jetty<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.319> left<00:03:58.530> side<00:03:58.739> is

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
looking at a jetty and the left side is

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.830 
looking at a jetty and the left side is
built<00:03:59.219> up<00:03:59.400> more<00:03:59.699> than<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.939> right<00:04:00.120> side<00:04:00.150> waves

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
built up more than the right side waves

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.749 
built up more than the right side waves
coming<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.229> from<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.439> left<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.549> right

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:02.759 
coming in from the left if the right

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.129 
coming in from the left if the right
side<00:04:02.969> is<00:04:03.120> going<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.269> be<00:04:03.359> built<00:04:03.629> up<00:04:03.780> more<00:04:03.989> than

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
side is going to be built up more than

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.289 
side is going to be built up more than
left<00:04:04.409> then<00:04:05.009> your<00:04:05.250> right<00:04:05.519> side<00:04:05.699> is<00:04:05.759> going<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.180> be

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
left then your right side is going to be

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.699 
left then your right side is going to be
the<00:04:06.419> area<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.959> which<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.259> waves<00:04:07.439> are<00:04:07.590> coming

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the area in which the waves are coming

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.949 
the area in which the waves are coming
in<00:04:07.949> from<00:04:08.129> so<00:04:09.060> when<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.299> take<00:04:09.419> a<00:04:09.479> look<00:04:09.689> here<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
in from so when you take a look here you

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.749 
in from so when you take a look here you
see<00:04:10.289> that<00:04:10.469> the<00:04:10.680> two<00:04:10.949> jetties<00:04:11.340> are<00:04:11.370> put<00:04:11.669> out

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
see that the two jetties are put out

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.439 
see that the two jetties are put out
into<00:04:11.969> the<00:04:12.030> water<00:04:12.180> you'll<00:04:12.810> notice<00:04:13.229> the

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
into the water you'll notice the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.610 
into the water you'll notice the
longshore<00:04:15.449> current<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.959> going<00:04:16.079> from<00:04:16.320> left<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
longshore current is going from left to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.949 
longshore current is going from left to
right<00:04:16.859> across<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.190> picture<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.449> so<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.930> see

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
right across the picture here so you see

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.479 
right across the picture here so you see
the<00:04:19.139> word<00:04:19.289> accretion<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.070> also<00:04:20.219> means

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the word accretion that also means

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.879 
the word accretion that also means
deposition<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.719> left<00:04:21.930> side<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.650> jetty

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
deposition so the left side of the jetty

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:23.659 
deposition so the left side of the jetty
is<00:04:23.130> being<00:04:23.340> built

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
is being built

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.339 
is being built
more<00:04:23.939> so<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.210> waves<00:04:24.389> are<00:04:24.509> coming<00:04:24.629> in<00:04:24.840> from<00:04:25.199> the

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
more so the waves are coming in from the

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.550 
more so the waves are coming in from the
left<00:04:25.969> he's<00:04:26.969> an<00:04:27.090> actual<00:04:27.330> photograph<00:04:27.569> notice

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
left he's an actual photograph notice

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.350 
left he's an actual photograph notice
the<00:04:28.650> left<00:04:28.830> side<00:04:29.009> of<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.189> jetty<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.610> much<00:04:30.090> much

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
the left side of the jetty is much much

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.450 
the left side of the jetty is much much
bigger<00:04:30.780> than<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.409> right<00:04:31.650> side<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.159> your<00:04:32.279> waves

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
bigger than the right side so your waves

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.379 
bigger than the right side so your waves
must<00:04:32.759> be<00:04:32.879> coming<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.300> from<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:33.749> left<00:04:38.120> now<00:04:39.120> you

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
must be coming in from the left now you

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.390 
must be coming in from the left now you
do<00:04:39.509> have<00:04:39.539> some<00:04:39.810> depositional<00:04:40.289> features<00:04:40.680> that

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
do have some depositional features that

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.670 
do have some depositional features that
we<00:04:41.610> need<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.819> come<00:04:41.969> talk<00:04:42.180> about<00:04:42.479> one<00:04:43.379> is<00:04:43.499> what

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
we need to come talk about one is what

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.320 
we need to come talk about one is what
calls<00:04:43.919> spit<00:04:44.310> that's<00:04:44.789> going<00:04:44.999> to<00:04:45.060> be<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> narrow

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
calls spit that's going to be a narrow

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.239 
calls spit that's going to be a narrow
sandbar<00:04:45.629> that<00:04:46.110> almost<00:04:46.439> acts<00:04:46.650> like<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.860> finger

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
sandbar that almost acts like a finger

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.610 
sandbar that almost acts like a finger
and<00:04:47.430> it<00:04:47.520> shows<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.909> wave<00:04:48.090> direction<00:04:48.689> and<00:04:48.870> also

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
and it shows the wave direction and also

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.969 
and it shows the wave direction and also
barrier<00:04:49.949> islands<00:04:50.520> which<00:04:50.909> are<00:04:51.090> narrow<00:04:51.979> bands

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
barrier islands which are narrow bands

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.219 
barrier islands which are narrow bands
of<00:04:53.129> sand<00:04:53.520> that<00:04:54.090> can<00:04:54.270> extend<00:04:54.509> for<00:04:54.719> hundreds<00:04:55.139> of

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
of sand that can extend for hundreds of

miles<00:04:55.469> along<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.039> coastline<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.669> basically

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
miles along the coastline that basically

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.420 
miles along the coastline that basically
make<00:04:57.569> a<00:04:57.599> very<00:04:58.080> very<00:04:58.289> narrow<00:04:58.650> island<00:04:59.219> chain

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
make a very very narrow island chain

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.519 
make a very very narrow island chain
called<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.240> barrier<00:05:00.539> island<00:05:00.779> and<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.379> good

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529 
called a barrier island and a good

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.749 
called a barrier island and a good
example<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.009> might<00:05:02.069> be<00:05:02.250> Long<00:05:02.580> Beach

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
Island in New Jersey and these things

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.409 
Island in New Jersey and these things
are<00:05:04.710> actually<00:05:04.889> good<00:05:05.729> enough<00:05:05.849> and<00:05:06.210> big<00:05:06.360> enough

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
are actually good enough and big enough

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.649 
are actually good enough and big enough
to<00:05:06.750> actually<00:05:06.900> protect<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.439> shoreline<00:05:08.659> so

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
to actually protect the shoreline so

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.209 
to actually protect the shoreline so

see<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:33.539> narrow<00:05:33.779> strip<00:05:34.139> there<00:05:34.409> usually<00:05:34.949> need

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
see the narrow strip there usually need

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:36.499 
see the narrow strip there usually need
a<00:05:35.099> little<00:05:35.339> bit<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:35.639> bridge<00:05:35.849> to<00:05:36.060> get<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> there

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
a little bit of a bridge to get to there

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:37.969 
a little bit of a bridge to get to there
but<00:05:36.900> essentially<00:05:37.379> you're<00:05:37.500> looking<00:05:37.529> at<00:05:37.949> a

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
but essentially you're looking at a

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.719 
but essentially you're looking at a
barrier<00:05:38.400> island<00:05:39.770> now<00:05:40.770> our<00:05:40.979> ocean<00:05:41.460> currents

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
barrier island now our ocean currents

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.129 
barrier island now our ocean currents
are<00:05:41.789> extremely<00:05:42.360> important<00:05:42.810> here<00:05:42.930> because

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
are extremely important here because

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.929 
are extremely important here because
first<00:05:44.039> off<00:05:44.219> they're<00:05:44.370> going<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.550> be<00:05:44.610> powered<00:05:44.909> by

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
first off they're going to be powered by

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.240 
first off they're going to be powered by
our<00:05:45.210> Sun<00:05:45.419> they're<00:05:46.349> going<00:05:46.589> to<00:05:46.680> help<00:05:46.919> distribute

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
our Sun they're going to help distribute

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.860 
our Sun they're going to help distribute
energy<00:05:47.759> across<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.210> planet<00:05:48.449> so<00:05:48.689> ocean

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
energy across the planet so ocean

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.110 
energy across the planet so ocean
currents<00:05:49.319> bring<00:05:49.500> cold<00:05:49.770> water<00:05:50.069> towards<00:05:51.060> the

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
currents bring cold water towards the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.290 
currents bring cold water towards the
equator<00:05:51.449> and<00:05:52.460> ocean<00:05:53.460> currents<00:05:53.759> bring<00:05:53.909> warm

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
equator and ocean currents bring warm

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.179 
equator and ocean currents bring warm
water<00:05:54.539> from<00:05:54.839> the<00:05:55.020> equator<00:05:55.050> towards<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:55.949> poles

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189 
water from the equator towards the poles

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.790 
water from the equator towards the poles
so<00:05:56.460> there's<00:05:57.270> a<00:05:57.330> constant<00:05:57.899> circulation<00:05:58.620> of

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
so there's a constant circulation of

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.279 
so there's a constant circulation of
energy<00:05:59.669> this<00:05:59.819> con<00:06:00.089> circulation<00:06:00.689> of<00:06:00.779> nutrients

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
energy this con circulation of nutrients

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.709 
energy this con circulation of nutrients
throughout<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.770> entire<00:06:02.189> planet<00:06:02.729> so<00:06:03.539> you'll

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
throughout the entire planet so you'll

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.629 
throughout the entire planet so you'll
notice<00:06:03.990> here<00:06:04.139> that<00:06:04.379> your<00:06:04.649> ocean<00:06:05.069> currents<00:06:05.490> are

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
notice here that your ocean currents are

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.290 
notice here that your ocean currents are
going<00:06:06.539> to<00:06:06.629> be<00:06:06.930> a<00:06:06.960> major<00:06:07.529> conveyor<00:06:08.520> belt<00:06:08.849> with

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
going to be a major conveyor belt with

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.040 
going to be a major conveyor belt with
cold<00:06:09.629> water<00:06:09.810> sinking<00:06:10.289> and<00:06:10.469> warm<00:06:11.279> water<00:06:11.490> rising

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
cold water sinking and warm water rising

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.269 
cold water sinking and warm water rising
essentially<00:06:13.050> you're<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:13.529> to<00:06:13.710> get<00:06:13.830> a<00:06:13.860> major

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
essentially you're going to get a major

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.790 
essentially you're going to get a major
convection<00:06:15.060> cell<00:06:15.270> throughout<00:06:15.629> your<00:06:15.810> oceans

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
convection cell throughout your oceans

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.170 
convection cell throughout your oceans
throughout<00:06:17.279> the<00:06:17.399> planet<00:06:17.759> just<00:06:18.120> like

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
throughout the planet just like

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.149 
throughout the planet just like
convection<00:06:18.779> in<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.050> asthenosphere<00:06:19.349> just

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
convection in the asthenosphere just

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.369 
convection in the asthenosphere just
like<00:06:20.279> convection<00:06:20.819> in<00:06:20.969> the<00:06:21.029> atmosphere<00:06:21.870> your

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
like convection in the atmosphere your

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.100 
like convection in the atmosphere your
ocean<00:06:22.770> currents<00:06:23.069> work<00:06:23.219> the<00:06:23.399> exact<00:06:23.759> same<00:06:23.789> way

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
ocean currents work the exact same way

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.450 
ocean currents work the exact same way
what<00:06:25.110> also<00:06:25.319> is<00:06:25.620> going<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:25.949> have<00:06:26.189> a<00:06:26.219> major

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
what also is going to have a major

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.579 
what also is going to have a major
impact<00:06:26.610> here<00:06:27.180> is<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.870> deflection<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.439> your

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
impact here is the deflection of your

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.499 
impact here is the deflection of your
ocean<00:06:28.889> currents<00:06:29.189> your<00:06:29.610> ocean<00:06:30.029> currents<00:06:30.419> are

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
ocean currents your ocean currents are

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:31.730 
ocean currents your ocean currents are
going<00:06:30.689> to<00:06:30.750> be<00:06:30.810> affected<00:06:31.229> by<00:06:31.319> the<00:06:31.379> Coriolis

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
going to be affected by the Coriolis

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.769 
going to be affected by the Coriolis
effect<00:06:32.279> just<00:06:32.940> like<00:06:33.060> your<00:06:33.240> wind<00:06:33.419> belts<00:06:33.659> are

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:33.779 
effect just like your wind belts are

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:35.540 
effect just like your wind belts are
there's<00:06:34.319> something<00:06:34.529> because<00:06:34.800> ocean<00:06:35.190> currents

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
there's something because ocean currents

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.360 
there's something because ocean currents
are<00:06:35.659> flu

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
are flu

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.800 
are flu
so<00:06:38.370> you<00:06:38.460> see<00:06:38.610> here<00:06:38.760> is<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:38.940> major<00:06:39.120> convection

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
so you see here is the major convection

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.950 
so you see here is the major convection
belt<00:06:40.050> all<00:06:40.650> the<00:06:41.610> way<00:06:41.760> throughout<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.660> entire

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
belt all the way throughout the entire

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.570 
belt all the way throughout the entire
planet<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.380> blue<00:06:43.680> represents<00:06:44.250> the<00:06:44.370> cold

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
planet the blue represents the cold

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.430 
planet the blue represents the cold
water<00:06:44.820> that's<00:06:45.090> going<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:45.300> sink<00:06:45.540> you<00:06:46.080> see<00:06:46.290> the

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
water that's going to sink you see the

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.260 
water that's going to sink you see the
warm<00:06:46.710> waters<00:06:47.040> relatively<00:06:47.580> red<00:06:47.820> are<00:06:47.940> aren't

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
warm waters relatively red are aren't

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.110 
warm waters relatively red are aren't
here<00:06:48.450> which<00:06:48.660> is<00:06:48.810> going<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.080> rise<00:06:49.440> and<00:06:50.060> also<00:06:51.060> you

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
here which is going to rise and also you

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.060 
here which is going to rise and also you
can<00:06:51.450> see<00:06:51.660> here<00:06:51.690> very<00:06:51.900> simply<00:06:52.440> if<00:06:52.500> you<00:06:52.590> look<00:06:52.860> at

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
can see here very simply if you look at

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.690 
can see here very simply if you look at
the<00:06:53.790> North<00:06:54.210> Atlantic<00:06:54.750> and<00:06:55.430> the<00:06:56.430> South

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
the North Atlantic and the South

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.030 
the North Atlantic and the South
Atlantic<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.570> also<00:06:58.440> if<00:06:58.530> you<00:06:58.620> look<00:06:58.770> in<00:06:58.950> the

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
Atlantic and also if you look in the

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.490 
Atlantic and also if you look in the
North<00:06:59.250> and<00:06:59.400> South<00:06:59.460> Pacific<00:06:59.900> you<00:07:00.900> will<00:07:01.020> notice

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
North and South Pacific you will notice

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.340 
North and South Pacific you will notice
that<00:07:01.770> the<00:07:02.750> ocean<00:07:03.750> currents<00:07:04.169> are<00:07:04.260> being

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
that the ocean currents are being

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.710 
that the ocean currents are being
affected<00:07:05.130> by<00:07:05.250> the<00:07:05.310> Coriolis<00:07:05.730> effect<00:07:06.210> you'll

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
affected by the Coriolis effect you'll

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.090 
affected by the Coriolis effect you'll
see<00:07:06.900> that<00:07:07.050> your<00:07:07.200> ocean<00:07:07.560> currents<00:07:07.889> for<00:07:08.040> the

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
see that your ocean currents for the

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.100 
see that your ocean currents for the
most<00:07:08.280> part<00:07:08.520> go<00:07:08.669> in<00:07:08.880> a<00:07:09.030> clockwise<00:07:09.180> direction<00:07:09.690> in

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
most part go in a clockwise direction in

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.719 
most part go in a clockwise direction in
the<00:07:10.200> North<00:07:10.410> they're<00:07:10.860> deflected<00:07:11.370> to<00:07:11.460> the<00:07:11.550> right

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
the North they're deflected to the right

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.640 
the North they're deflected to the right
southern<00:07:12.510> hemisphere<00:07:12.870> they're<00:07:13.350> in<00:07:13.560> a

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
southern hemisphere they're in a

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.650 
southern hemisphere they're in a
counterclockwise<00:07:13.950> direction<00:07:14.540> deflected<00:07:15.540> to

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 
counterclockwise direction deflected to

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.659 
counterclockwise direction deflected to
the<00:07:15.690> south<00:07:15.990> so<00:07:16.860> make<00:07:17.010> sure<00:07:17.040> you<00:07:17.250> check<00:07:17.370> out<00:07:17.520> my

we<00:07:20.490> get<00:07:20.610> into<00:07:20.729> a<00:07:20.760> little<00:07:20.820> bit<00:07:20.970> more<00:07:21.060> detail

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
we get into a little bit more detail

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.360 
we get into a little bit more detail
about<00:07:21.540> that<00:07:21.780> so<00:07:22.500> that's<00:07:22.650> it<00:07:22.800> for<00:07:22.919> now<00:07:23.010> on<00:07:23.040> ocean

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
about that so that's it for now on ocean

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.360 
about that so that's it for now on ocean
currents<00:07:23.669> we'll<00:07:23.880> talk<00:07:24.060> to<00:07:24.150> you<00:07:24.240> soon
