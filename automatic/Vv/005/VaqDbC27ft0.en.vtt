in<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.530> horrible<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> people

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
in it's horrible I think a lot of people

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.060 
in it's horrible I think a lot of people
liked<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.199> though<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> mean<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.710> guess<00:00:58.859> that's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
liked it though I mean I guess that's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.240 
liked it though I mean I guess that's
this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> big<00:01:00.510> reasons<00:01:00.539> why<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
this is one of the big reasons why I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.889 
this is one of the big reasons why I
became<00:01:02.250> successful<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.090> guess<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.539> people

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
became successful I guess because people

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
became successful I guess because people
found<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> video<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> entertaining<00:01:05.460> and
