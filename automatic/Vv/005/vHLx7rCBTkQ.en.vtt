00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
bag and actually did a video like this
about<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> year<00:00:46.260> ago<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:46.950> using<00:00:47.250> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
has a day I'm not the biggest fan of it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
has a day I'm not the biggest fan of it
I<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.009> works<00:01:32.159> okay<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.939> has<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> really

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
I think it works okay it has a really

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
I think it works okay it has a really
really<00:01:33.720> big<00:01:34.049> brush<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
really big brush but I think that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.890 
really big brush but I think that
because<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.939> flexible<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:36.869> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
because it's so flexible it's kind of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.130 
because it's so flexible it's kind of
harder<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.950> work<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.329> me<00:01:39.570> but

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
harder to like work with it for me but

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.929 
harder to like work with it for me but

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
using the NYX retractable lip liner in

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.259 
using the NYX retractable lip liner in
Ruby<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.019> it's<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.500> really<00:03:49.530> beautiful

bright<00:03:51.269> red<00:03:52.170> color<00:03:52.530> and<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:54.360> thought<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.660> I'd

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
bright red color and I thought that I'd

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.210 
bright red color and I thought that I'd
be<00:03:54.810> easier<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.380> bring<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.860> lip<00:03:56.040> liner

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
be easier to just bring a lip liner

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.280 
be easier to just bring a lip liner
instead<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.730> lipstick<00:03:57.180> since<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.870> lasts

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
instead of lipstick since it lasts

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.160 
instead of lipstick since it lasts
longer<00:03:58.650> also<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.510> another<00:04:00.510> lipstick<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:00.989> I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
