00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hello everybody 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.570
 Today I want you the k4 104 b 15 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.980
 to introduce kaiser chiefs 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.389
 the knife became friends with the knife 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 facebook from the manufacturer for a few 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.260
 surround provided at the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.050
 Thank you to miro that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 pastor and organized we come to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 the knife will make of no 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 china made, however, it is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.449
 Emperor is not about the typical 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.590
 manufacturer of Chinese knives so come 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.630
 comparatively high value 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329
 materials for use from japan 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.829
 or america are imported and also 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 Processing technology are the knives 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.489
 of emperor of a slightly higher level 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.469
 this is reflected in the price 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.980
 Contrary to that, the knives cost between 100 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.980
 and 200 euros 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.750
 but let's get started with them 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.719
 technical data on the knife 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 altogether it is 21 3 cm long whereby the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.609
 cutting phase is 91 centimeters long 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.590
 it weighs 145 grams and the blade it 4 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.789
 mm wide 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 so I would rate it as medium-sized to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.390
 designate a big knife 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.610
 as mentioned above is based on 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 higher quality materials are included 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.760
 the knife a blade from the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220
 japanese vg10 steel for use 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.799
 The stall is ostric and has one 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.320
 neat cut kite containing the one 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.200
 side is black gc and the side 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.430
 with the framework is titan 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.530
 the titan side became blue first 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 analyzed and then with a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.930
 higher voltage with yellow and again 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.930
 strip provided 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.920
 let's start with the things at the fair 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.810
 have liked it 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.430
 that would be the first of the small gang 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.509
 who had a knife with bronze 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.509
 already quite okay 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.530
 especially considering that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.369
 knife is still new and is still new 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.439
 will import 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.719
 another point of me very well 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.070
 like the frame lures often have 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:01.039
 titan frameworks the properties 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.509
 so they do not jam anymore 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.409
 can be unlocked easily 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.070
 this is not the case with the master 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.630
 except for a very light one 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:17.239
 grind it wonderful and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:18.550
 rules in the open state holds the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.500
 Frame lures the blade securely locked 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.870
 vertical is none and horizontal only 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.370
 minimal game available which 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.930
 a tightening of the ax screw adjusted 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 could be left at the ax 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.470
 screw that I like quite well 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 Although you need either a special 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.049
 tool or a very narrow one 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.830
 screwdriver around the clean gear 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.599
 adjust 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.599
 There's more to it than visually 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.709
 I like the sanding notch next 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.930
 The knife can be so long 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.430
 sharpen without having to deal with the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.720
 time a small recurve bow pure 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.130
 grinds now to the things that me 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.410
 the masters did not like it so much 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.260
 First, there would be the optics to me 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 It's playful to me personally 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.190
 more like titan page only 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.190
 blue would have been noted and emperor is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.359
 the colorful stripes would have been omitted 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.799
 Of course that's a matter of taste, though 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.380
 this reminds me a little bit of the knife 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.790
 Wrapping paper 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.230
 another point of criticism is like you 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.250
 the extradition can see sharpness 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.250
 which leaves much to be desired 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.240
 It does not bother me since I mean 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.500
 new knife first time even sharpen this 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.180
 but is also different you can see 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:53.910
 for example at this spyder weird yet 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:55.530
 the delivery sharpness sits there 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.600
 little sense makes a blunt knife 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.920
 I have to test it after consultation with 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.030
 me without the other participants of the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.030
 Patrons sharpened 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.550
 and others for a few semesters 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.509
 typical tasks pose no problem 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.509
 for the knife there 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.550
 we come to the other points the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.500
 I did not like it that much 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.700
 kaiser live there is on the homepage 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.770
 that the fair is at the highest level 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.690
 finished and every component with the 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.610
 lowest tolerances is produced 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.080
 besides the not so good delivery 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.729
 sharpness was already in the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.729
 Delivery condition cats of the sounds 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.810
 of course you can argue now 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.060
 that the knife is a tool and 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.669
 Come in now , that costs 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.080
 knife 120 euro and with the analyzed 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.820
 Maybe it will be the titan side too 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.010
 to appeal to one or another collector 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.150
 then the coward will not come 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.150
 is completely medical 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.720
 besides, there were a few more 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.400
 Titan later from the production better 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.330
 which I would have quite easy 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.740
 avoid it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.490
 I'll tell you a few pictures 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.490
 fade in 

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:13.220
 another point is the belt click 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.130
 tip down what can be attached to me 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.570
 I would like it very much 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.360
 I do not want any style for one 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.840
 Cover with supplies the children is to 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.840
 example dead 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.260
 do not get me wrong apart from 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.790
 the sharpness of delivery concern the 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.250
 just mentioned points just that that are 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.810
 not the functionality and the problem 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.830
 the delivery sharpness can be 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.380
 fix it quickly 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.940
 However, acts an award of 120 euros 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.310
 for a knife made in china 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.680
 and the statement of the manufacturer world 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.260
 to design and produce class 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.460
 but certain expectations on one point 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.590
 I still want to go in is the 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.360
 flipper the only knife with pinball 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.640
 what I currently have and with this here 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.100
 I can compare to the 18 of 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.190
 hinderer Here's what to you I rufer 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.540
 just to have the best pinball machine 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.860
 but what I like is that 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.080
 hinder the often with a camping 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.220
 understand so that you know the same 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.100
 that you do not pull the pinball machine 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:20.660
 but you also have to press the 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.070
 ill rounded so that it too 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.090
 a long time not unpleasant 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.920
 becomes the whiz of k 44 p1 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.300
 works fine though 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.350
 i miss a camping so that you can 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.150
 not very clear if I am the pinball 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.150
 should pull or press 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.510
 In addition, the edges would have rounded 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.510
 can be 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.320
 apart from that , I am missing myself 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.360
 negative on the knife on the rest 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.950
 Processing is alright the knife 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.480
 is good in the hand and also in the 

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.960
 one can not use the materials used 

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.880
 say 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.590
 and if you have a sharp model without 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.710
 scratch or titan is caught later 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.820
 the price quite reasonable 

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.300
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.300
 next time
