00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.990
 so comrade boris, hello to you 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.380
 today we mean I donâ€™t even remember 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.859
 What about the day of the battle with the crouton? 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.270
 here today we despise the valve that is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.789
 washed cleaned from us 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.439
 pretty valve paradise means so take 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.870
 fist take oil think nothing 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.840
 this is the absolute oil motul and kuindzhi 530 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 frequency we apply valve stem to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.530
 he went well in his sleeve then we 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.710
 take this one 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.050
 abrasive paste for grinding valves 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 Production America speak very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.300
 good well as I looked she really 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.610
 stricter adjust oneself but just two valves 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.979
 our so become a valve take insert 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:14.040
 place we had such a problem that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 intake we have us bad she went to 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 good condition graduations were in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 average satisfactory condition so 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.610
 can be said but to make it so for yourself 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 and hints take and wipe for everything and 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.960
 intake and exhaust means intake me 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 already at ter doing graduation 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.860
 valves 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 to speed up your process and not 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.100
 torment took the screw and that means 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.500
 pre clothing yes so to speak 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 oxygen hose 9 millimeters 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.370
 slim just exactly fit on 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:00.210
 valve for easy shooting 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:03.930
 and lapping dressing means hose and skouma 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 valve most important valve 3 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.860
 somewhere 30 seconds one way 3 friend 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.110
 100 for 3 means not constantly leaning 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.060
 that is, wipe you a little twist 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 there is a moment when a little against 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.730
 you let go so as not to set fire to the edge 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.590
 there is a valve chamfer then pressed a little 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.380
 released pressed I switch another 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.160
 slightly twisted the side pressed it 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.710
 so makarom 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.720
 that is, we give the bridge the chamfer edition and 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.040
 same time we are all good 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.040
 rubs it so look 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.400
 yes means rubbed shoot 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.400
 screwdriver pull out our valve 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:09.489
 wiped out our night river pasta tyrannus 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:17.079
 panther and george wipe cycles 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:20.190
 heads wipe yes the most important thing is 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.160
 if we have 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.389
 rubbing valve well that is 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.370
 paschka 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.490
 It turns out what should not be brilliant 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.910
 be from like a burmatov we take an ordinary 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.830
 pencil is the simplest 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.070
 pencil do such reading marks 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.419
 two or three 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:47.680
 not necessarily 4 i.e. spread 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.509
 we design the valve we insert at the place 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.630
 and so simple 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:56.729
 tricks it turns 108 degrees 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.729
 slightly pressing down the right 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:05.409
 then deliver it with a fist and check if 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:11.199
 tags erased they we erased 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:14.110
 it means smooth well with damn well it 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.349
 half the case that is, it may seem that 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.530
 well come maybe something else after 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:23.610
 everything has been fully trailing head 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.260
 sugared back flipped 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.900
 that way and that is 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.810
 camera data itself camera 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.580
 the girl burns it all down 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.110
 develops diesel do the level 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.630
 the head to put the form is poured 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.910
 a dog for the night as a result 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.160
 in the morning you come and you can if you 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.720
 level and well worth still here 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.030
 you know everything will come to us and 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:00.200
 amazing if any of that 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:05.000
 diesel flowed out means the valve is bad when 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.730
 rubbed because of this you can see 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.640
 on start-up and releases which valve will 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:13.760
 bad come and means grinding it 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.760
 valve must be implemented again for 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:20.840
 so that everything is good as 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:25.720
 do it for yourself and not someone here and our 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.330
 so here and we live every day 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.100
 thank everyone for watching 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.100
 come see a lot of new
