other transmission control unit that I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
other transmission control unit that I
got<00:00:47.660> they've<00:00:48.660> replaced<00:00:49.020> those<00:00:49.350> resistors

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
with half watt resistors like I did this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
with half watt resistors like I did this
one<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.710> burned<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
one was actually burned up when I got it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150 
one was actually burned up when I got it
or<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.260> having<00:00:55.500> trouble<00:00:55.649> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
or when I was having trouble this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
or when I was having trouble this
resistor<00:00:56.579> here<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.879> burned<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.329> that's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
resistor here was burned out and that's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.880 
resistor here was burned out and that's
why<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> replaced<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> said<00:00:58.590> no<00:00:58.680> no<00:00:58.770> they

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
why I replaced it and I said no no they

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
why I replaced it and I said no no they
should<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.160> been<00:00:59.250> using<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.579> half<00:00:59.730> walk<00:00:59.969> turn

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
should have been using a half walk turn

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
should have been using a half walk turn
off<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> other<00:01:01.170> transmission<00:01:01.859> they've

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
off on the other transmission they've

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
off on the other transmission they've
replaced<00:01:02.760> these<00:01:03.149> two<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.860> these<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:04.920> with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
replaced these two and these two with

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.060 
replaced these two and these two with
half<00:01:05.549> watts<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.619> I'm<00:01:07.619> gonna<00:01:07.770> check<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
half watts and I'm gonna check the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.570 
half watts and I'm gonna check the
voltage<00:01:08.189> value<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.659> all<00:01:09.780> 35

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
voltage value because these are all 35

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
voltage value because these are all 35
and<00:01:11.689> 35<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.049> 50s

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and 35 to 50s

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
and 35 to 50s
except<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> 10<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
except they have a 10 this one here I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.920 
except they have a 10 this one here I
believe<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> 10<00:01:16.830> volt<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.330> too

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
believe is a 10 volt which is way too

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219 
believe is a 10 volt which is way too

you'd<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> put<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.939> least<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.210> 10<00:02:00.479> bull

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you'd want to put it at least a 10 bull

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.139 
you'd want to put it at least a 10 bull
or<00:02:00.930> bigger<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.469> there<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> 12<00:02:02.909> volt

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
or bigger in there if this is a 12 volt

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.630 
or bigger in there if this is a 12 volt
you<00:02:03.479> could<00:02:03.630> put<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> like<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> 25<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.250> bigger<00:02:05.430> in

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
you could put it like a 25 or bigger in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.900 
you could put it like a 25 or bigger in
there<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.020> again<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> rest<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.399> are<00:02:08.489> 35

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
there and again the rest of them are 35

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.410 
there and again the rest of them are 35
and<00:02:08.940> 50<00:02:09.539> s<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.099> there's<00:02:11.099> 110<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and 50 s and there's 110 and it's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.510 
and 50 s and there's 110 and it's
Plus<00:02:13.050> these<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.319> electrolytic<00:02:13.920> capacitors

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
Plus these are electrolytic capacitors

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.160 
Plus these are electrolytic capacitors
in<00:02:14.700> electronic<00:02:15.510> industry<00:02:15.630> they've<00:02:16.020> been

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
in electronic industry they've been

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.770 
in electronic industry they've been
having<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.530> lot<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.709> trouble<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.220> these<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
having a lot of trouble with these the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.420 
having a lot of trouble with these the
lectures<00:02:19.140> break<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:22.250> chemicals<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
lectures break the chemicals and it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.920 
lectures break the chemicals and it
break<00:02:23.610> down<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.209> there's<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> little

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
break down and then there's a little

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.059 
break down and then there's a little
excess<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.290> don't<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.739> see<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:25.980> on

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
excess I don't know if you can see it on

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.800 
excess I don't know if you can see it on
top<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.400> there<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.880> X<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.750> that's

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
top of there is a little X and that's

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.930 
top of there is a little X and that's
actually<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.739> fails<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.400> explodes

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
actually so when this fails and explodes

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.170 
actually so when this fails and explodes
internally<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.860> has<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.040> relief<00:02:32.340> valve<00:02:32.370> kind<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
internally it has a relief valve kind of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.820 
internally it has a relief valve kind of
built<00:02:33.540> into<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.050> why<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.319> cuts<00:02:34.620> in

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
built into it that's why that cuts in

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.770 
built into it that's why that cuts in
the<00:02:34.920> top<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.580> it'll<00:02:35.880> bulge<00:02:36.209> out<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.660> that's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the top and it'll bulge out and that's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.880 
the top and it'll bulge out and that's
usually<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
usually a you can see it but that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.220 
usually a you can see it but that
doesn't<00:02:38.220> mean<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.580> capacitors<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.180> good<00:02:40.080> if

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
doesn't mean the capacitors not good if

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.339 
doesn't mean the capacitors not good if
it<00:02:40.350> doesn't<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> bulge<00:02:41.900> because<00:02:42.900> like<00:02:43.230> on

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
it doesn't have a bulge because like on

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.710 
it doesn't have a bulge because like on
this<00:02:43.470> one<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.830> almost<00:02:44.040> looks<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.720> don't

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
this one it almost looks like I don't

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.000 
this one it almost looks like I don't
know<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.019> can<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.560> or<00:02:46.620> not<00:02:46.680> but

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
know if you can see it or not but

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.460 
know if you can see it or not but
there's<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> bulge<00:02:48.150> coming<00:02:48.569> out<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.870> side<00:02:49.200> on

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
there's a bulge coming out the side on

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.479 
there's a bulge coming out the side on
one<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.830> capacitors<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:53.370> can

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
one of the capacitors and so that can

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:53.840 
one of the capacitors and so that can
happen

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
happen

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.910 
happen
they<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.269> also<00:02:54.390> leak<00:02:54.660> out<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.019> bottom<00:02:55.530> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
they can also leak out the bottom and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.170 
they can also leak out the bottom and
they<00:02:56.040> might<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:56.370> leak<00:02:56.519> at<00:02:56.670> all<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.940> could<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
they might not leak at all it could just

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.940 
they might not leak at all it could just
degree<00:02:57.600> internally<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.680> didn't

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
degree internally and it didn't

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.699 
degree internally and it didn't
catastrophic<00:02:59.670> ly<00:02:59.819> fail<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.200> not<00:03:01.380> longer

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
catastrophic ly fail but it's not longer

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.800 
catastrophic ly fail but it's not longer
giving<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.700> correct<00:03:02.819> capacitance<00:03:03.600> which

giving the correct capacitance which

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.970 
capacitors and there's a formula for
figuring<00:03:12.480> stuff<00:03:12.780> out<00:03:13.049> that's<00:03:13.319> how<00:03:13.769> they're

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
figuring stuff out that's how they're

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
figuring stuff out that's how they're
supposed<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.280> behave<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.260> either<00:03:16.260> the
