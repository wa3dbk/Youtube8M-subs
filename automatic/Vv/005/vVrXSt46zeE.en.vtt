00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.780 
battery it is battery to sit right here
and<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.290> reason<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.650> got<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.340> because<00:02:18.640> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
and the reason I got this is because it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
and the reason I got this is because it
includes<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.540> cigarette<00:02:20.290> lighter<00:02:20.350> port<00:02:20.890> so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
includes a cigarette lighter port so

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.470 
includes a cigarette lighter port so
when<00:02:21.310> I'm<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.579> car<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.120> charge<00:02:22.329> my
