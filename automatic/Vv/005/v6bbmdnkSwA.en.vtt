00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.429
 Yes Leon Channel is Masked Rider Glidon with Acorn Arms 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:15.349
 It looks like the above, but in this video, we use the other four riders 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.349
 I would like to verify if I can wear Acorn Arms more than Greenon 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.840
 Arm So of brown under-suit of brown 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.230
 Surprising and per Yoroibu I'd have no reason that do not meet Connie feel a great match likely 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.410
 I will 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.519
 First of all, it will be attached to Samu 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.790
 The first is acorn state or this is not it hard to look good 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:41.240
 This acorn building is enough even in this state 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.270
 Let's expand if it looks like fighting 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.780
 Yes Ayumu acorn arms are ah ah ah ah ah 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:52.250
 This is it suits very much as expected 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.370
 After all brown arms match in this navy undersuit 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:01.700
 I can see clearly that the clothes are already changing 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.260
 It's not good, but next time I'm going to Barong , let's walk in the dongle state and reply 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.400
 Yes Acorn Arms of Masked Rider Baron 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.580
 It is not too cool even with a balloon, but it looks good. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 I do not hate so much when I look at it as a whole 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.710
 It's surprisingly cool even if you don't have one . 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.200
 It does not fit into such will do this combination 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.969
 Next is the dragon garden 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.969
 Court Sanmichi 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.590
 It is a Kamen Rider Ryugen Acorn Arms Mitch who looks good on anything but this is also a little 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 Is it floating? 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 It and Aikawara not areola will change the impression of the face so easy to understand changes in the compound eye is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 Then in the end is Zantsuki first astringent state 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.370
 Melo 23 is also expected to change in this state 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.020
 Outside house 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.960
 Produce 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 Yes it is the acorn Arms of Rider Zangetsu this is good or cool or uncool 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.579
 I do not know 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:04.390
 The remaining moon is cool but it is acorn ah 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.040
 When someone wears anything, it looks like to arms 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.470
 Seeing behind like this near me, it looks fine 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.370
 I do not agree with such in white body, even I have a twin-lens also changed 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.519
 If you take the Don value and put on your usual equipment 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.160
 It doesn't look cool 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.480
 Oh 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.820
 It doesn't match, and the melon defender and the acorn go out, so the affinity of the guest is so much 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.570
 Yes there is a place to put on the Dandelaire 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:35.040
 It still has is becoming a little small fish-ish feel 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.150
 For various riders using the Acorn Arms of Masked Rider Gridone by entering 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.480
 To arrive just below 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 From the conclusion, after all Gridon looks best 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.780
 Just individuals 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:50.220
 In fact, I liked Amui's Acorn Arms quite well 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 This was the acorn Arms of attachment verification moving more'm pretty cool 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030
