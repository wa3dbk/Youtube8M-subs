00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.820
Hi folks and welcome to one more video on the Pompeia Hidroméis Channel!

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.300
Today I'll gonna talk about how to make Requeijão (a cream cheese) at home.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.620
Easy and fun you'll spend no more than 20 or 30 minutes.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.620
and you'll have your cheese made.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.480
I'll tell about the ingredients as they are used, but in the end I'll put a list (That I forgot in the video... is in the description!)

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.160
let's take a look at this recipe, 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.240
But before, just remembering, if you like Pompeia Hidroméis Channel, thanks

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.680
This helps me to keep up with this channel!

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.920
Back to our homemade cream cheese.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.360
First thing to do is: put on the stove two liters of milk

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.820
Prefereable the as pure as possible

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.380
In Brazil milk grade A or B will result in a better cream cheese

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.380
Heat the milk, if you wanna boil it to pasteurize that's ok.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.260
Soon as it heat or boil

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.360
add six teaspoons (four work as well) of vinager

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.280
may be any kind of vinager, we just need it to make the curds

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.160
Can I use rennet? Yes, but I choose vinager cause is something we probably have at home.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160
Let's wait it to get hot.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.660
So.... my milk is very hot already

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.120
As it's almost boiling I'll turn off the fire

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.260
So I'll add my six teaspoons of vinager and mix well

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.340
After this you wait to curds to form.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.060
Just remembering: the curds should not take long to form

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.740
I just mixed the vinager and I already can see some curds forming on the top

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.560
So this sould be very quick

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.180
From time to time you can check wit the spoon

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.460
Look how we already have some curd

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.260
So when is well firm we can continue the proccess

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.060
No more than 5 minutes and I already have it!

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360
Curds are ready!

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.320
Now we must take this cream that formed

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
I'll use a strain to do this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.300
And I'll place it inside the blender jar

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.780
So... capture your curd...

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.140
All the serum that will remain in the pan will be discharged

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.280
And try to remove as much serum as possible

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.640
Keep moving the curds, press with the spoon

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.600
It'a really important you remove the serum

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.800
Do it before use the blender. If you let some serum in the curds it'll give some rancid taste

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.280
And we don't wan't it

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Just press well

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.400
You will have at the end a very homogeneous cheese mass

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.440
Se repeat this process until you have removed the serum from all the curd

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.820
Now that I have all my curd in here, 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.680
next step is to add two teaspoons of salted buttter

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.840
If you don't know how to make butter at home, just check the link on the screen

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.600
You will learn how to make your own butter.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.080
So here are two teaspoons of salted butter.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.680
And if you want you can add some more salt

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.800
Add as much as you like the salt

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.640
Now let's take this to the blender

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.440
And the secret to adjust the texture is to add little by little some whole milk as you blend it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440
until reach the creaminess you like

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.360
If you don't add milk it will probably be like a processed cheese

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.900
So add milk and let it the way you like it

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.480
Let's start blending our "requeijão"

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.760
Add milk little by little

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.840
Only to adjust the final texture

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.260
Don't over do it. Put 50ml by time until reach what you want

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.580
Weel actually check the texture even before the first milk addition, maybe is the way you like it!

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.240
But if needed little by little...

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.560
I just fineshed mine here... and it's already with a very nice texture

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.060
Can you see it? no... let me turn here..

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.720
it's already creamy, nice

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.480
But it's a little bit hot

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.800
Now put it in a pot and tomorrow it will be firm and creamy

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.280
How beautiful.... less than half an hour... easy to do!

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.080
And not half an hour strait... some steps you need just to wait!

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.300
I'll put it to cool and after I'll show you!

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.580
After a while in the refrigerator

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.080
Look at this... ups I messed here... 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.460
but look at the texture of our "requeijão"

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.220
What you think about it? Cool doesn't it?

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.660
Try passing it in a cracker

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.760
I'll pass a lot... ohhh, it already holds!

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.320
That's the real thing!

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760
now... let me taste it!

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.140
Let's try this "requeijão"

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.320
humm!

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:40.140
Amazing!Home made!And well kept you can store it one week in the refrigerator!

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.740
