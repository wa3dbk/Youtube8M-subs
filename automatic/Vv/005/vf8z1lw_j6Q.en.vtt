you<00:01:45.819> go<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:45.999> market<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.740> reason<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.159> that

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
you go to market and the reason of that

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.190 
you go to market and the reason of that
side<00:01:48.490> as<00:01:48.729> two<00:01:49.299> people<00:01:49.479> could<00:01:49.719> left<00:01:49.929> them<00:01:50.049> onto

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
side as two people could left them onto

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.289 
side as two people could left them onto
the<00:01:50.350> side<00:01:50.529> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.679> horse<00:01:50.770> or<00:01:51.069> smaller<00:01:51.819> volume

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
the side of the horse or smaller volume

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.870 
the side of the horse or smaller volume
but<00:01:52.689> easier<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.229> left<00:01:53.439> so<00:01:53.859> we've<00:01:54.549> reintroduced

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
but easier to left so we've reintroduced

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.480 
but easier to left so we've reintroduced
this<00:01:55.389> process<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.109> it's<00:01:56.409> become<00:01:57.069> one<00:01:57.099> of<00:01:57.310> our

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
this process and it's become one of our

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.399 
this process and it's become one of our
fastest<00:01:57.909> growing<00:01:58.060> vines<00:01:58.420> over<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:58.990> last<00:01:59.139> few

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
fastest growing vines over the last few

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.069 
fastest growing vines over the last few
years<00:02:00.209> what<00:02:01.209> I<00:02:01.240> think<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.539> should<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.779> know<00:02:01.810> I

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
years what I think we should you know I

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.569 
years what I think we should you know I
think<00:02:02.289> we<00:02:02.349> should<00:02:02.469> basically<00:02:02.889> pull<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> boner

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.339 
think we should basically pull a boner
at<00:02:03.849> one<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.060> these<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.389> you<00:02:04.719> can<00:02:04.899> show<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.139> the
