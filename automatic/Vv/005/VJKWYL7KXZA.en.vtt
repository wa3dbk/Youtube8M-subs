00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.510
 other players and some little ones 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.640
 bonus in 1.7 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 so I'm going to want to do heavy 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.529
 that I'm going to do it in 1.8 since the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.950
 orders are no longer the same 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.620
 then we will get back to normal view 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.710
 and I made a kind of small 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.059
 laboratory a long time I took advantage 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.850
 here is nothing a few small bugs 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 still with my computer but that's it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:57.379
 these words so here's for the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.379
 heads of characters from other heads 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:08.320
 other players it's very simple 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:16.690
 do yves slash at space @ b 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:32.090
 colada had the honor with a capital s 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 to no ono with a big o and you do 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.970
 two points and there you put the name of the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:44.990
 player so here I'm going to put the ten ones 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.729
 feel and use 00 it closes there only for 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.550
 hug 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.450
 hop I think I have not put any p 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.280
 upper case and that's so you can 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:06.080
 do that with all the players 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:08.770
 6 blu best 9 hop here you see 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.130
 you can do with all the heads 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.800
 idem for creatures you can 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.020
 have the heads of creatures doing 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.090
 just the same command except you 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.240

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.140
 you put the name of the creature 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.720
 so here I'm going m bigs obviously with 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.910
 always capitalized in front of others 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.480
 ways I will put you all the all 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.400

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.520

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.950
 heads 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.010
 then we'll go to the little ones 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.030
 little bonuses like that I do it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.800
 quickly since how 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.620
 more to say compared to 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.830
 the other video but it's very simple mhf 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:19.470
 for example but your gestures hop c 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.420
 uppercase chest hop I know there are some 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.700

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.830
 I did not find them but I 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.040

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.080
 with the arrows the different 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:50.459
 stuff actually in the end 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:54.660
 so this is you this time you 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:57.510
 do where there are arrows so there 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:04.230
 where the heads wholesale with arrows 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:07.410

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:13.130
 water like that and there you put left 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.900
