00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.800
 with the last few releases you have become 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.230
 actively criticize geopolitics and all 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.940
 what is connected with it before this is not 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.010
 noticed you could you 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.920
 tell in brief about the history of this science 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.570
 if this is pseudoscience why its terminology 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.080
 publicly used by many respected 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.270
 people including Putin means in 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.130
 lately i can politics became 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.239
 often speak because geopolitics 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.680
 so let's say intensified and trying 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.750
 swing those questions that relate to 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.380
 global policy areas and pervert 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.130
 their understanding 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.140
 same science it is not it just 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.110
 cargo cult again I repeat it altogether 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.570
 no science how can you imagine 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.590
 there is some sort of Papuan tribe and 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.780
 the book and is there a base of americans whether 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.520
 they sometimes there toss stew but 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.760
 they see something someone flies by 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.309
 the plane is given then give the stew and 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.189
 here the Papuans think that if we are now out 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.780
 straw with weave to the plane on him 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:15.770
 let us pray and it will give us stew yes or 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.680
 there is still some kind of something and here weaved not 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.960
 it turns out you are wrong here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.840
 Here's a straw wove it should be like this 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.360
 here weave you then your stew 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.360
 will come here is geopolitics 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.600
 and what kind of science can go here? 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.180
 it is generally crazy understanding of what 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.939
 there is a civilization sea ​​civilization land 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.210
 Yes, here is the fleet of China in the 16th century was and more powerful 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.229
 and better than the European fleet as 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.330
 technologically and in terms of management 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:57.259
 however, China is recorded in civilization 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:00.620
 sushi a and let's say spain write down 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.670
 civilization there is a sea because it sleeps 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.480
 conquistadors there swam in clean 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.860
 geography 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.400
 breaks off but why yes because or 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.310
 the same Carthage had a better fleet than Rome 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.880
 but because rome conquered civilization 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.250
 grief and Carthage lost means themselves 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.700
 zation of sushi and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 handed down with this expression of napoleon 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.450
 geography is a sentence like you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.920
 civilization land never win 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.320
 Well, then what is Russia to twitch 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.690
 sushi civilization beacon against 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.560
 uk twitch but everybody lie down and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.180
 and give up so talk about some 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.590
 there is no science at all 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.620
 why another thing 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.310
 why did she even appear and how are you 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.730
 what people are doing 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.250
 control they understand that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.640
 don't even do this management what 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.770
 there is domestic state policy 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.489
 there is foreign policy but 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.230
 suddenly people involved in foreign policy 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.660
 state and partly domestic 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.930
 face manifestations of some 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.680
 policy that changes position 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.720
 states here is a state in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.930
 relations with other states and 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.150
 here comes some process and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.150
 political who do not fit either 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.930
 political processes it 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.080
 foreign policy process they are some 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.690
 Others so that people could not with this 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.380
 Deal deal they say and this deal 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 politics is the politics of the earth you let's 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.670
 here it is there nato master the science 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.900
 which is there british rehab 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.730
 planted by the way 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.330
 in order to dig in this sandbox 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.680
 they thought how to weave straw 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.430
 instead of mastering the real 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.080
 management and while people rummage in 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.080
 they do not interfere with geopolitics 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.030
 the same about britain by seas 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.130
 britten is an empire which is not 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.960
 the sun sets to rule the world well and 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.890
 that the British Empire broke up 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.410
 Many there think that the British Empire 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.290
 broke up that she in the second world 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.760
 the war entered the empire over which not 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.370
 the sun set and after the second world 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.990
 of war she already collapsed in fact 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.150
 not so the fact is that the nations 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:38.150
 they do not accept direct dictation and 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.890
 how to capture the country and manage 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.200
 it and use its resources 6 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.170
 prioritization management was therefore 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.110
 changed form was upgraded with 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.730
 which is the colonization of this 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:56.690
 State 6 management priority by 3 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.660
 and everything and no have already disappeared for dea 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.490
 British Empire politicians can not see it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.170
 and in global politics it manifests itself 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.340
 and not to understand how she 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.370
 here you are functioning 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.310
 understand geopolitics let's 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.450
 delve into this sandbox play 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.140
 just do not bother us to carry out 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.140
 global policy 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.830
 follow fire and in that respect 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.790
 why politicians use a pr 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.100
 do you understand when the media 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.810
 information analysts of different begin 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.140
 speak group levitskogo politics 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.669
 certain terminology is introduced 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.660
 planted down management structures 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.120
 different countries on this but when 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.050
 politics uses the term and geopolitics 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.740
 need to understand 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.190
 he understands control and use 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.640
 for 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.590
 on the fact that etiquette is so understand that 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.979
 here should use these words for 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.380
 to be led as if for his own 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.550
 there was no unnecessary confrontation or he 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.940
 as 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.730
 the parrot just thoughtlessly repeats this 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.390
 these words of this for politics 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.020
 any policy is very important and at the same time 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:11.150
 need to understand a simple thing well imposed 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.030
 us geopolitics well, it's not a sentence 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.870
 that someone out there with is geopolitics 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.180
 plunge somewhere reconsider 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.220
 rate and move on this is you new 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.340
 knowledge no one is left to lie in 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:28.570
 puddle when it fell 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.550
 rise go further then my clothes 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:33.920
 how Stalin used her time in 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.680
 terminology to Marxism yes but it is not 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.610
 prevented him before stalin used 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.990
 Marxist terminology in order to 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.210
 build true communism 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.080
 although Marxism and communism are perfect 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.080
 Different things
