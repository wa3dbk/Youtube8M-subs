00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
showed you on the guitar one two three

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.039 
showed you on the guitar one two three
four<00:03:47.409> five<00:03:47.709> frets<00:03:48.099> right<00:03:48.430> you've<00:03:49.419> got<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.659> name

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
four five frets right you've got a name

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.709 
four five frets right you've got a name
each<00:03:50.319> chord<00:03:50.680> so<00:03:51.299> even<00:03:52.299> though<00:03:52.389> this<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.659> a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:52.719 
each chord so even though this is a

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.470 
each chord so even though this is a
t-shape<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:53.469> no<00:03:53.650> longer<00:03:53.889> d<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:54.609> five<00:03:54.909> frets

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
t-shape it's no longer d it's five frets

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.059 
t-shape it's no longer d it's five frets
higher<00:03:55.689> so<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:55.989> would<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.230> D<00:03:56.680> d<00:03:57.639> sharp<00:03:57.669> e<00:03:58.389> F<00:03:59.349> F

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
higher so that would be D d sharp e F F

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.670 
higher so that would be D d sharp e F F
sharp<00:04:00.519> G<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.840> G<00:04:02.169> chord<00:04:02.620> now<00:04:03.459> has<00:04:03.790> a<00:04:03.819> d-shake

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
sharp G so the G chord now has a d-shake

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.289 
sharp G so the G chord now has a d-shake
you<00:04:05.680> know<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:05.799> could<00:04:06.040> explain<00:04:06.639> it<00:04:06.819> again<00:04:07.060> but

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
you know I could explain it again but

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.809 
you know I could explain it again but
look<00:04:07.629> at<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.780> this<00:04:07.840> way<00:04:08.159> every<00:04:09.159> chord<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.669> you

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
look at it this way every chord that you

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.930 
look at it this way every chord that you
play<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:11.069> five<00:04:12.069> frets<00:04:12.370> higher<00:04:12.579> than<00:04:12.819> it

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
play is five frets higher than it

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.399 
play is five frets higher than it
normally<00:04:13.060> would<00:04:13.299> be<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.810> got<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> name<00:04:14.199> it
