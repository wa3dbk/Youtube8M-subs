00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
can imagine that I know 56 doesn't

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.779 
can imagine that I know 56 doesn't
actually<00:01:31.000> look<00:01:31.420> too<00:01:31.899> strong<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:33.580> certain

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
actually look too strong it in certain

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.999 
actually look too strong it in certain
situations<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:34.660> I<00:01:34.929> actually<00:01:35.560> like<00:01:35.860> these

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
situations but I actually like these

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.520 
situations but I actually like these
kind<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.369> hands<00:01:36.670> believe<00:01:37.300> me<00:01:37.420> if<00:01:37.599> I<00:01:37.750> had<00:01:38.020> an<00:01:38.289> ace

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
kind of hands believe me if I had an ace

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.150 
kind of hands believe me if I had an ace
five<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.459> an<00:01:39.819> a6<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.509> would<00:01:40.899> fold<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:42.009> a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
five or an a6 I would fold this in a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.609 
five or an a6 I would fold this in a
second<00:01:42.640> because<00:01:43.300> I<00:01:43.840> could<00:01:44.380> pretty<00:01:44.530> much

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
second because I could pretty much

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.830 
second because I could pretty much
assume<00:01:45.069> that<00:01:45.190> I'm<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.580> be<00:01:45.729> dominated<00:01:46.209> so

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
assume that I'm going to be dominated so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.990 
assume that I'm going to be dominated so
I<00:01:46.869> let's<00:01:47.560> say<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:48.009> he<00:01:48.130> does<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.520> some<00:01:48.729> over

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
I let's say that he does have some over

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.290 
I let's say that he does have some over
cards<00:01:49.530> I'm<00:01:50.530> 32<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:51.459> I'm<00:01:51.550> getting<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:51.910> exact

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
cards I'm 32 so I'm getting the exact

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.919 
cards I'm 32 so I'm getting the exact
pot<00:01:52.780> odds<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.410> call<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:55.149> that's<00:01:55.330> not<00:01:55.509> the

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
pot odds to call this but that's not the

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.719 
pot odds to call this but that's not the
only<00:01:55.989> thing<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.410> look<00:01:56.590> at<00:01:56.739> when<00:01:56.979> you're<00:01:57.220> in<00:01:57.670> a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
only thing you look at when you're in a

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.719 
only thing you look at when you're in a
single<00:01:58.300> situation<00:01:58.979> because<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.130> do<00:02:00.369> have<00:02:00.399> to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
single situation because you do have to

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.609 
single situation because you do have to
look<00:02:00.849> at<00:02:00.970> your<00:02:01.119> situational<00:02:01.780> analysis<00:02:02.440> as

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
look at your situational analysis as

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.169 
look at your situational analysis as
well<00:02:02.649> but<00:02:03.009> just<00:02:03.310> before<00:02:03.459> we<00:02:03.700> get<00:02:03.789> back<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.149> that

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
well but just before we get back to that

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.650 
well but just before we get back to that
let's<00:02:05.050> say<00:02:05.349> he's<00:02:05.920> got<00:02:06.340> an<00:02:06.789> even<00:02:06.970> slightly

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
let's say he's got an even slightly

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
let's say he's got an even slightly
better<00:02:08.200> hand<00:02:08.649> maybe<00:02:09.489> he's<00:02:09.819> got<00:02:10.060> pocket<00:02:10.840> jacks

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
better hand maybe he's got pocket jacks

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.830 
better hand maybe he's got pocket jacks
which<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.819> likely<00:02:13.300> move<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:16.510> know<00:02:16.629> he

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
which is a likely move that you know he

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.720 
which is a likely move that you know he
might<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.140> been<00:02:17.260> playing<00:02:17.770> here<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.370> I'll

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
might have been playing here so I'll

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.380 
might have been playing here so I'll
just<00:02:19.349> get<00:02:20.349> those<00:02:20.560> odds<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.129> I'm<00:02:22.060> actually

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
just get those odds and I'm actually

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
just get those odds and I'm actually
quite<00:02:23.080> an<00:02:23.290> underdog<00:02:23.650> here<00:02:24.129> at<00:02:24.280> nearly

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
quite an underdog here at nearly

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.640 
quite an underdog here at nearly
while<00:02:27.640> i'm<00:02:27.790> getting<00:02:28.120> about<00:02:28.210> twenty<00:02:28.660> two

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
while i'm getting about twenty two

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.310 
while i'm getting about twenty two
percent<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.370> i'm<00:02:30.550> slightly<00:02:31.510> better<00:02:31.810> than<00:02:31.900> four

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
percent so i'm slightly better than four

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.160 
percent so i'm slightly better than four
to<00:02:32.440> one<00:02:32.560> odds<00:02:32.710> are<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.490> or<00:02:33.580> less<00:02:34.170> 31

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
to one odds are it's more or less 31

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.360 
to one odds are it's more or less 31
really<00:02:35.500> three-to-one<00:02:36.280> odds<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:38.160> he's<00:02:39.160> going

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
really three-to-one odds that he's going

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.020 
really three-to-one odds that he's going
to<00:02:39.430> win<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:40.660> i<00:02:41.050> really<00:02:41.440> don't<00:02:41.470> think<00:02:41.680> he<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.040> he

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
to win but i really don't think he is he

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.880 
to win but i really don't think he is he
has<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.170> put<00:02:44.350> him<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.620> over

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
has that I really do put him on the over

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.280 
has that I really do put him on the over
cards<00:02:45.190> another<00:02:45.580> even<00:02:45.910> better<00:02:46.210> situation<00:02:47.020> let

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
cards another even better situation let

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.590 
cards another even better situation let
me<00:02:47.520> point<00:02:48.520> something<00:02:48.610> out<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.240> he

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
me point something out to you that he

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.360 
me point something out to you that he
could<00:02:49.780> very<00:02:50.110> likely<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.770> moving<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.220> with

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
could very likely be moving in with

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.550 
could very likely be moving in with
something<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:51.850> pocket<00:02:52.270> fours<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.870> this

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
something like pocket fours and this

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.590 
something like pocket fours and this
would<00:02:53.710> even<00:02:53.860> be<00:02:54.010> better<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.730> me<00:02:54.760> because<00:02:54.880> in

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
would even be better for me because in

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.810 
would even be better for me because in
this<00:02:55.750> spot<00:02:55.990> here<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.650> am<00:02:57.610> virtually<00:02:58.420> even<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
this spot here I am virtually even and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.340 
this spot here I am virtually even and
so<00:03:00.820> these<00:03:00.940> are<00:03:01.120> some<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> likely<00:03:01.780> hands

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
so these are some of the likely hands

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.340 
so these are some of the likely hands
you<00:03:03.010> know<00:03:03.100> eights<00:03:03.580> nines<00:03:04.090> tens<00:03:04.780> things<00:03:05.170> like

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
you know eights nines tens things like

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.840 
you know eights nines tens things like
that<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.730> really<00:03:07.060> I'm<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:08.820> quite<00:03:09.820> sure

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
that but really I'm up I'm quite sure

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.180 
that but really I'm up I'm quite sure
that<00:03:10.360> he<00:03:10.600> has<00:03:10.780> over<00:03:11.170> cards<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.680> he's<00:03:11.770> moving

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
that he has over cards and he's moving

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.920 
that he has over cards and he's moving
in<00:03:12.310> on<00:03:12.460> me<00:03:12.700> because<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.180> his<00:03:13.390> first<00:03:13.600> decent

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
in on me because it's his first decent

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.760 
in on me because it's his first decent
pace<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.500> he's<00:03:14.680> had<00:03:14.950> now<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.000> am<00:03:16.480> getting<00:03:17.020> the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
pace that he's had now I am getting the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.210 
pace that he's had now I am getting the
actual<00:03:18.520> right<00:03:18.910> odds<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:20.170> call<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:20.680> because

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
actual right odds to call this because

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.660 
actual right odds to call this because
it's<00:03:21.460> three<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.790> two<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.680> know<00:03:23.800> in<00:03:23.950> terms<00:03:24.460> of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it's three to two you know in terms of

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.460 
it's three to two you know in terms of
him<00:03:24.880> having<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.270> over<00:03:25.690> cards<00:03:25.990> that<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
him having to over cards that and

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.260 
him having to over cards that and
unassumingly<00:03:27.280> I'm<00:03:27.550> guessing<00:03:27.910> right<00:03:28.030> there

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
unassumingly I'm guessing right there

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.760 
unassumingly I'm guessing right there
too<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.600> there<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.780> course<00:03:29.110> there<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.590> risk

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
too and there of course there is risk

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.760 
too and there of course there is risk
that<00:03:30.010> I'm<00:03:30.160> not<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:31.450> I'm<00:03:31.570> not<00:03:31.690> correct<00:03:32.110> but

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
that I'm not that I'm not correct but

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.600 
that I'm not that I'm not correct but
the<00:03:33.459> thing<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.770> actually<00:03:36.070> have

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
the thing is is that you actually have

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.970 
the thing is is that you actually have
to<00:03:36.730> look<00:03:36.940> more<00:03:37.330> or<00:03:37.480> less<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:38.020> chip<00:03:38.530> stack<00:03:38.770> and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
to look more or less at chip stack and

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.770 
to look more or less at chip stack and
where<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.430> going<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.790> be<00:03:39.910> in<00:03:40.360> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
where you are going to be in the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.310 
where you are going to be in the
situation<00:03:41.320> where<00:03:41.590> you've<00:03:42.900> where<00:03:43.900> you've<00:03:44.080> lost

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
situation where you've where you've lost

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.210 
situation where you've where you've lost
and<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:46.030> would<00:03:46.330> think<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.930> after<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:48.010> know<00:03:48.160> I

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
and I would think that after you know I

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.070 
and I would think that after you know I
put<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.580> another<00:03:48.820> thousand<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.600> would<00:03:49.780> still<00:03:49.959> be

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
put in another thousand I would still be

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.160 
put in another thousand I would still be
at<00:03:50.140> 4,600<00:03:51.239> so<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.510> that<00:03:52.630> would<00:03:52.810> move<00:03:52.989> this

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
at 4,600 so and that would move this

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.949 
at 4,600 so and that would move this
player<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:54.070> about<00:03:54.340> 2500<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.480> then<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.840> have

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
player up to about 2500 and then I have

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
player up to about 2500 and then I have
another<00:03:56.019> player<00:03:56.410> over<00:03:56.650> here<00:03:56.950> at<00:03:57.040> 1800<00:03:57.610> they

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
another player over here at 1800 they

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.720 
another player over here at 1800 they
have<00:03:58.390> both<00:03:58.540> been<00:03:58.600> playing<00:03:59.200> pretty<00:03:59.620> weak<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
have both been playing pretty weak and I

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.530 
have both been playing pretty weak and I
think<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:02.040> even<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.459> do<00:04:03.519> lose<00:04:03.880> I'm<00:04:04.180> still

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
think that even if I do lose I'm still

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.050 
think that even if I do lose I'm still
going<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.840> at<00:04:05.019> least<00:04:05.080> in<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.590> money<00:04:05.739> but<00:04:06.459> if

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
going to be at least in the money but if

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.550 
going to be at least in the money but if
I<00:04:07.209> win<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.690> then<00:04:07.989> I'm<00:04:08.260> pretty<00:04:08.500> much

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
I win this then I'm pretty much

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.350 
I win this then I'm pretty much
guaranteed<00:04:09.100> first<00:04:09.340> place<00:04:09.610> here<00:04:09.880> because<00:04:10.209> I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
guaranteed first place here because I

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.170 
guaranteed first place here because I
know<00:04:10.420> this<00:04:10.660> other<00:04:10.870> player<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.320> terribly<00:04:11.890> weak

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
know this other player is terribly weak

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.060 
know this other player is terribly weak
so<00:04:15.269> after<00:04:16.269> thinking<00:04:17.230> about<00:04:17.410> all<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.830> and
