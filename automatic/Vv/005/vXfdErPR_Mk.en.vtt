00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
here is a comparison with a mock I've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.560 
here is a comparison with a mock I've
made<00:00:37.160> roughly<00:00:38.160> oh<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.640> made<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.120> year<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
made roughly oh I made it this year I

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.500 
made roughly oh I made it this year I
made<00:00:40.230> her<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.559> year<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.760> gotta<00:00:41.910> move<00:00:42.300> back

for<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> looks<00:00:44.520> totally<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
for this this looks totally it's just

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.119 
for this this looks totally it's just
really<00:00:48.300> weird<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.020> comparing<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.559> better<00:00:49.890> off

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
really weird and comparing it better off

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.529 
really weird and comparing it better off
for<00:00:50.879> something<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:53.000> very<00:00:54.000> extremely

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
for something like a very extremely

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.430 
for something like a very extremely
dusty<00:00:54.899> shadow<00:00:55.320> gear<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> yeah<00:00:59.399> um<00:01:00.440> definitely

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
dusty shadow gear so yeah um definitely

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not my best MOC as of now but it was at

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.789 
not my best MOC as of now but it was at
the<00:01:07.740> time<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:09.229> figured<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> might<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:10.619> just

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the time so figured I might as well just

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
the time so figured I might as well just
do<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> request

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
do this it was a little bit of request

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.280 
do this it was a little bit of request
also<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:14.040> bit<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> mention<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.450> apologize

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
for the weird background I have to use
this<00:01:18.390> cuz<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> white<00:01:18.869> balance<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.439> really

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
this cuz the white balance is really

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.149

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
can't do the cool thing where he could

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.580

put<00:04:42.730> his<00:04:42.850> arm<00:04:43.000> back<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.930> he<00:04:44.380> can<00:04:44.470> basically

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
put his arm back and he can basically

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.340 
put his arm back and he can basically
just<00:04:44.860> take<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.250> out<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:46.600> Foshee<00:04:46.990> --the

just take it out of the Foshee --the
it's<00:04:47.830> not<00:04:48.130> even<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.430> sheath<00:04:48.640> it's<00:04:48.850> just<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.120> peg

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
it's not even a sheath it's just a peg

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.670 
it's not even a sheath it's just a peg
but<00:04:49.950> just<00:04:50.950> take<00:04:51.550> that<00:04:51.730> out<00:04:51.820> of<00:04:51.910> there<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:53.530> he

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
but just take that out of there then he

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.630 
but just take that out of there then he
can<00:04:53.800> wield<00:04:54.310> it<00:04:55.050> backwards<00:04:56.460> this<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.520> terrible

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
can wield it backwards this is terrible

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.840 
can wield it backwards this is terrible
but<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:01.030> is<00:05:01.210> copy<00:05:01.450> tech<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:02.670> despite<00:05:03.670> the

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
but that this is copy tech I despite the

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.360 
but that this is copy tech I despite the
fact<00:05:04.060> how<00:05:04.420> old<00:05:04.720> he<00:05:05.200> is<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.380> still<00:05:05.860> love<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.250> way

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
fact how old he is I still love the way

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.580 
fact how old he is I still love the way
he<00:05:06.610> looks<00:05:06.900> what<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:07.930> want<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.200> update<00:05:08.470> his

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
he looks what I want to update his

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.580 
he looks what I want to update his
design<00:05:08.890> I'm<00:05:09.760> not<00:05:09.970> too<00:05:10.360> big<00:05:10.750> into<00:05:10.960> making<00:05:11.170> Toa

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
design I'm not too big into making Toa

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.910 
design I'm not too big into making Toa
anymore<00:05:12.430> but<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.210> think<00:05:14.170> just<00:05:14.440> for<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.680> sake<00:05:14.890> of

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
anymore but I think just for the sake of

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.790 
anymore but I think just for the sake of
aesthetics<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.640> might<00:05:15.850> just<00:05:16.290> revamp<00:05:17.290> them<00:05:19.800> so

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
aesthetics I might just revamp them so

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.540 
aesthetics I might just revamp them so
that's<00:05:21.250> that's<00:05:21.610> copy<00:05:21.910> tech<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.600> stuff<00:05:23.550> let's

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550
