distance<00:03:27.810> straight<00:03:28.140> across<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.560> water<00:03:28.770> like

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
distance straight across the water like

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.520 
distance straight across the water like
that<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.850> cause<00:03:30.060> water<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.720> engulf<00:03:31.290> this

with<00:05:43.069> my<00:05:43.219> arms<00:05:43.610> off<00:05:43.849> to<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.419> to<00:05:44.689> the<00:05:45.229> left<00:05:45.469> or

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
with my arms off to the to the left or

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.170 
with my arms off to the to the left or
to<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.740> right<00:05:45.830> depending<00:05:46.279> on<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:46.879> distance<00:05:47.089> I

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
to the right depending on the distance I

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.790 
to the right depending on the distance I
see<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.449> Frog<00:05:47.659> not<00:05:47.899> if<00:05:47.960> you<00:05:48.080> don't<00:05:48.259> understand

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
see the Frog not if you don't understand

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.469 
see the Frog not if you don't understand
which<00:05:48.949> this<00:05:49.099> which<00:05:49.399> direction<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:50.120> fish<00:05:50.330> is

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
which this which direction the fish is

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.959 
which this which direction the fish is
going<00:05:50.779> that'll<00:05:51.529> be<00:05:51.620> difficult<00:05:51.800> for<00:05:52.189> you<00:05:52.399> but

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
going that'll be difficult for you but

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:54.969 
going that'll be difficult for you but
over<00:05:53.330> time<00:05:53.539> you'll<00:05:53.810> start<00:05:53.990> realizing<00:05:54.589> it<00:05:54.740> make

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
over time you'll start realizing it make

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.230 
over time you'll start realizing it make
sure<00:05:55.009> you<00:05:55.250> use<00:05:55.399> some<00:05:55.550> kind<00:05:55.729> of<00:05:55.759> line<00:05:55.969> that<00:05:56.000> you

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
sure you use some kind of line that you

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.329 
sure you use some kind of line that you
can<00:05:56.389> see<00:05:56.419> again<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.199> use<00:05:57.379> braid<00:05:57.770> so<00:05:58.009> I<00:05:58.069> can<00:05:58.250> see

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
can see again I use braid so I can see

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:59.679 
can see again I use braid so I can see
it<00:05:58.430> like<00:05:58.669> cutting<00:05:58.969> the<00:05:59.029> line<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.419> I<00:05:59.449> know

00:05:59.679 --> 00:05:59.689 
it like cutting the line and I know

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:03.159 
it like cutting the line and I know
where<00:05:59.990> it's<00:06:00.349> at<00:06:00.589> now<00:06:01.539> what<00:06:02.539> you're<00:06:02.689> gonna<00:06:02.779> want

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
where it's at now what you're gonna want

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.649 
where it's at now what you're gonna want

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
roof of the mouth of that fish and once

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.159 
roof of the mouth of that fish and once
