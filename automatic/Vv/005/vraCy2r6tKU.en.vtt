00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:36.020
This time I want to show you how I make a soap cake. Starting with some really simple techniques.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:01:00.480
I used only pastell colours. Yellow, pink, brown and white.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:49.580
I'm doing a simple pot swirl. I pour the colours in from a high point so they go all down to the bottom.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:33.900
Now I go around with a spatula. Mix it a bit but don't overmix, so you can't see the seperate colours in the end.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:57.440
The brown was supossed to be the cake base but it was too thin so it didn't work out like I wanted it.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:26.240
I smoothed the top out with a palette knife to get a nice surface.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.200
I used a template and golden Mica to decorate the cake.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.260
You can buy those templates in stores where you can get regular cake decorating stuff.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.220
I waited 8 hours before decorating, so I was easily able to take the template off after using it.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.940
I also dusted the whole cake lightly with silver mica.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.840
First I'm doing a simple shell border.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:26.040
Now I put one tiny amount of soap on each slice.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.760
I also did a shell border on the bottom part.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:51.200
I piped some yellow soap roses a few days before I made this cake to use as decoration.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.300
The last step is to pipe on some leafs with a leaf tip and some green soap.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:02.100
This is my final result, I hope you like it. See you in my next video.
