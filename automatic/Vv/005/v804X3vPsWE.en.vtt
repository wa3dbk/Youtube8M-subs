this<00:02:52.210> is<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> full-day<00:02:52.660> Trek<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.530> people<00:02:53.800> often

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
this is a full-day Trek and people often

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.090 
this is a full-day Trek and people often
wonder<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.760> know<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.270> do<00:02:55.480> when<00:02:55.780> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
need a raw food diet and you go on a

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.560 
need a raw food diet and you go on a
trip<00:02:59.800> like<00:02:59.830> this<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.460> what<00:03:00.910> I've<00:03:01.000> noticed<00:03:01.210> is

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
trip like this and what I've noticed is

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.600 
trip like this and what I've noticed is
that<00:03:01.630> what<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.560> need<00:03:03.070> when<00:03:03.310> you're

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
that what you really need when you're

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.450 
that what you really need when you're
going<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> trip<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.320> or<00:03:05.500> Trek<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:06.040> a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
going on a trip like this or Trek is a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.700 
going on a trip like this or Trek is a
lot<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:07.030> energy<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.110> need<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> lot<00:03:08.680> of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
lot of energy so you need a lot of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.150 
lot of energy so you need a lot of
carbohydrates<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.700> see<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.030> lot<00:03:10.240> of<00:03:10.270> hikers

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
carbohydrates I see a lot of hikers

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.480 
carbohydrates I see a lot of hikers
bring<00:03:12.160> things<00:03:12.460> like<00:03:12.610> crackers<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.690> and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
bring things like crackers and and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.550 
bring things like crackers and and
cheese<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.970> meat<00:03:16.240> sandwiches<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.110> nut<00:03:17.320> bars

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
cheese and meat sandwiches and nut bars

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.860 
cheese and meat sandwiches and nut bars
and<00:03:18.100> really<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.180> doesn't<00:03:19.390> really<00:03:19.660> make<00:03:19.840> sense

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and really it doesn't really make sense

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.400 
and really it doesn't really make sense
because<00:03:20.290> when<00:03:20.650> you're<00:03:20.830> going<00:03:21.190> on<00:03:21.340> very<00:03:21.610> steep

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
because when you're going on very steep

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.460 
because when you're going on very steep
tracks<00:03:23.410> like<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.520> here<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:26.260> all<00:03:26.440> day

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
tracks like like here and going all day

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.440 
tracks like like here and going all day
you<00:03:26.800> spend<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.190> lot<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.370> energy<00:03:27.610> but<00:03:28.090> what<00:03:28.300> you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
you spend a lot of energy but what you

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.170 
you spend a lot of energy but what you
really<00:03:28.480> need<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:29.020> carbohydrates<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.850> what<00:03:31.150> I

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
really need is carbohydrates so what I

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.240 
really need is carbohydrates so what I
do<00:03:31.330> is<00:03:31.750> it's<00:03:31.960> kind<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.230> an<00:03:32.320> exception<00:03:32.920> what<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
do is it's kind of an exception what of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.180 
do is it's kind of an exception what of
what<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:33.940> normally<00:03:34.510> eat<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:34.960> I<00:03:35.140> eat<00:03:35.440> dried<00:03:35.800> fruit

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
what I normally eat is I eat dried fruit

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.420 
what I normally eat is I eat dried fruit
and<00:03:36.460> a<00:03:36.550> lot<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.870> dates<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.260> high<00:03:38.860> energy<00:03:39.130> high
