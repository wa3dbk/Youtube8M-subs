I am an artist visual artist programmer
based<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.490> London<00:00:11.910> UK<00:00:12.410> body<00:00:13.410> paint<00:00:14.509> came<00:00:15.509> about

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
based in London UK body paint came about

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.550 
based in London UK body paint came about
through<00:00:17.270> really<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> curiosity<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.990> had<00:00:19.289> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
through really a curiosity that I had of

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.490 
through really a curiosity that I had of
creating<00:00:20.550> visuals<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.930> using<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.350> mouse

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
creating visuals but not using a mouse

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
creating visuals but not using a mouse
and<00:00:22.769> keyboard<00:00:22.890> that's<00:00:23.820> really<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> was

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and keyboard that's really what it was

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.679 
and keyboard that's really what it was
it's<00:00:25.500> what<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> three-year-old<00:00:26.730> would<00:00:27.300> want<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it's what a three-year-old would want to

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.599 
it's what a three-year-old would want to
do<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.260> splatter<00:00:28.680> paint<00:00:29.039> onto<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> wall

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
do you know splatter paint onto the wall

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.310 
do you know splatter paint onto the wall
and<00:00:29.820> for<00:00:30.359> me<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> important<00:00:31.080> thing<00:00:31.199> about

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and for me the important thing about

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.290 
and for me the important thing about
something<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.800> body<00:00:32.040> painters<00:00:32.520> not

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
something like body painters not

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.060 
something like body painters not
necessarily<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> idea<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
necessarily the idea but the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.240 
necessarily the idea but the
believability<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:37.170> drips<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.129> way

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
believability of the drips and the way

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
believability of the drips and the way
it<00:00:38.399> moves<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.480> people<00:00:39.899> actually<00:00:40.280> feel

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it moves so that people actually feel

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
it moves so that people actually feel
like<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.850> are<00:00:42.050> painting<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.440> their

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
like they are painting with their

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
like they are painting with their
movements<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.730> public<00:00:45.149> need<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.809> able<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
movements the public need to be able to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
movements the public need to be able to
interact<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.950> understand<00:00:47.489> how<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
interact with it and understand how it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
interact with it and understand how it
works<00:00:47.850> immediately<00:00:48.480> body<00:00:49.440> paint<00:00:49.770> works<00:00:50.039> with

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
works immediately body paint works with

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.990 
works immediately body paint works with
the<00:00:50.730> camera<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.690> normal<00:00:52.020> web<00:00:52.170> cam<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:53.370> high

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the camera it's a normal web cam a high

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
the camera it's a normal web cam a high
quality<00:00:54.059> webcam<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.590> feed<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> passed

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
quality webcam and that feed is passed

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.240 
quality webcam and that feed is passed
on<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.120> computer<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> computer<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
on to a computer and on the computer is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.060 
on to a computer and on the computer is
a<00:00:59.280> custom<00:00:59.789> software<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.690> written<00:01:01.070> and

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
a custom software that I've written and

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.910 
a custom software that I've written and
which<00:01:02.309> analyzes<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> webcam<00:01:03.539> feed<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
which analyzes the webcam feed and it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.760 
which analyzes the webcam feed and it
creates<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.850> visuals<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.479> see

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
creates the visuals that you see

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.740 
creates the visuals that you see
essentially<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> video<00:01:09.450> game

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
essentially it's like it's a video game

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
essentially it's like it's a video game
it's<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.350> technology<00:01:10.890> as<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.460> video<00:01:11.790> game

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's the same technology as a video game

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's the same technology as a video game
it's<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.869> real-time<00:01:13.110> graphics<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:14.040> analyzes

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it's as real-time graphics it analyzes

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's as real-time graphics it analyzes
the<00:01:14.850> camera<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> designed<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.560> cope<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the camera so it's designed to cope with

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.480 
the camera so it's designed to cope with
as<00:01:17.100> many<00:01:17.250> people<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.700> possible<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:19.490> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
as many people as possible and that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.520 
as many people as possible and that's
part<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> fun<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.720> often<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> see

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
part of the fun because often you see

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
part of the fun because often you see
people<00:01:23.270> collaboratively<00:01:24.270> painting

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
people collaboratively painting

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
people collaboratively painting
something<00:01:25.380> together<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.220> destroying<00:01:27.180> each

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
something together or destroying each

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
something together or destroying each
other's<00:01:27.659> paintings<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.439> throwing<00:01:28.799> paint<00:01:29.159> at

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
other's paintings or throwing paint at

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640 
other's paintings or throwing paint at
each<00:01:29.490> other<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.110> creates<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.500> whole

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
each other and it just creates a whole

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.890 
each other and it just creates a whole
new<00:01:31.680> dynamic<00:01:31.920> between<00:01:32.490> how<00:01:32.880> people<00:01:33.329> engage

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
new dynamic between how people engage

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.230 
new dynamic between how people engage
with<00:01:34.409> each<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> installation

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
with each other through the installation

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.520 
with each other through the installation
it's<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.590> been<00:01:37.740> interesting<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's really been interesting to see the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.609 
it's really been interesting to see the
extreme<00:01:40.530> opposite<00:01:40.860> people<00:01:42.619> interacting

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
extreme opposite people interacting

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
extreme opposite people interacting
within<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.070> don't<00:01:44.790> consider<00:01:45.090> body<00:01:45.390> paint<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.049> be

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
within I don't consider body paint to be

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.240 
within I don't consider body paint to be
a<00:01:46.470> project<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.399> itself<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.869> part<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
a project in itself but it's part of a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.510 
a project in itself but it's part of a
very<00:01:50.460> long<00:01:50.640> project<00:01:51.110> which<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> create

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
very long project which is how to create
