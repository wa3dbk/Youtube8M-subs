got<00:06:14.860> us<00:06:14.890> a<00:06:15.100> runaway<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:17.770> don't<00:06:18.280> know<00:06:18.370> but<00:06:18.640> the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
got us a runaway I don't know but the

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.190 
got us a runaway I don't know but the
thing<00:06:18.880> is<00:06:19.060> they<00:06:19.270> cannot<00:06:19.450> afford<00:06:19.600> to<00:06:19.900> buy<00:06:20.020> on

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
thing is they cannot afford to buy on

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480 
thing is they cannot afford to buy on
because<00:06:20.350> they're<00:06:20.440> not<00:06:20.500> cheap<00:06:20.800> so<00:06:21.010> I'm<00:06:21.280> just

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
because they're not cheap so I'm just

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.580 
because they're not cheap so I'm just
guessing<00:06:21.730> maybe<00:06:22.210> that's<00:06:22.480> wrong<00:06:22.630> with<00:06:22.780> me<00:06:22.840> but

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
guessing maybe that's wrong with me but

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.010 
guessing maybe that's wrong with me but
I<00:06:23.650> think<00:06:24.130> he<00:06:24.250> had<00:06:24.490> a<00:06:24.520> horse<00:06:24.910> Yeah<00:06:25.570> right<00:06:25.600> so

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
I think he had a horse Yeah right so

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.180 
I think he had a horse Yeah right so
that's<00:06:26.200> why<00:06:26.380> the<00:06:26.440> family<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:26.920> everybody

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
that's why the family that everybody

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.610 
that's why the family that everybody
they'd<00:06:27.520> spread<00:06:27.730> on<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.060> audience<00:06:28.510> I'm<00:06:29.410> saying

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
they'd spread on the audience I'm saying

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.660 
they'd spread on the audience I'm saying
I<00:06:29.710> don't<00:06:29.770> think<00:06:30.040> they<00:06:30.100> would<00:06:30.250> have<00:06:30.370> bought<00:06:30.490> it
