00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659 
yard looked like this beautiful with the

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.530 
yard looked like this beautiful with the
grass<00:02:15.019> for<00:02:15.680> about<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.159> summer<00:02:16.459> or<00:02:16.730> two<00:02:16.909> but

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
grass for about of summer or two but

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
grass for about of summer or two but
since<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.900> have<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.379> much<00:02:18.590> shade<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.250> my<00:02:19.280> yard

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
since I have so much shade in my yard

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
since I have so much shade in my yard
the<00:02:20.420> grass<00:02:20.450> didn't<00:02:21.140> survive

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the grass didn't survive

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.720 
the grass didn't survive
so<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.239> started<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.110> look<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:24.349> this<00:02:24.800> which<00:02:25.430> is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
so it started to look like this which is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.979 
so it started to look like this which is
not<00:02:26.390> beautiful<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> decided<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.569> get<00:02:29.750> rid<00:02:29.959> of

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
not beautiful so I decided to get rid of

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.729 
not beautiful so I decided to get rid of
the<00:02:30.170> grass<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:31.190> find<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.819> more<00:02:32.140> bed<00:02:33.140> areas

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the grass to find some more bed areas

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.610 
the grass to find some more bed areas
and<00:02:34.069> turn<00:02:34.790> my<00:02:35.060> yard<00:02:35.390> into<00:02:35.810> sort<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.319> rock

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
and turn my yard into sort of a rock

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
and turn my yard into sort of a rock
garden

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.740 

I<00:02:39.800> got<00:02:40.800> super<00:02:41.340> lucky<00:02:41.370> when<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.880> passed<00:02:42.270> by<00:02:42.420> Home

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
I got super lucky when I passed by Home

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.530 
I think they got new ones in and just
didn't<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.860> room<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:51.030> anyway<00:02:51.510> I

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
didn't have room for these but anyway I

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.650 
didn't have room for these but anyway I
lucked<00:02:52.050> out<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.190> got<00:02:53.460> lots<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.970> stones<00:02:54.330> to

lucked out and I got lots of stones to

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.550 
lucked out and I got lots of stones to
create<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:56.250> nice<00:02:56.430> beds<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.330> yard<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
create really nice beds in the yard so I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.620 
create really nice beds in the yard so I
dug<00:03:01.920> around<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.550> find<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> areas<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
dug around if you find the areas in the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.610 
dug around if you find the areas in the
filled<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.080> with<00:03:04.110> River<00:03:04.530> box<00:03:05.870> my<00:03:06.870> yard<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.410> on<00:03:07.590> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
filled it with River box my yard is on a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.460 
filled it with River box my yard is on a
slant<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.400> down<00:03:08.700> here<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.720> all<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.200> water

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
slant going down here so all the water

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.710 
slant going down here so all the water
from<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.130> neighborhood<00:03:11.760> rushes<00:03:12.360> down

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
from the neighborhood rushes down

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
from the neighborhood rushes down
through<00:03:13.170> my<00:03:13.410> yard<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.070> is<00:03:14.459> another<00:03:14.880> reason

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
through my yard this is another reason

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.930 
through my yard this is another reason
why<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.630> grasped<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.440> survived<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.310> river

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
why I grasped it and survived the river

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.810 
why I grasped it and survived the river
rocks<00:03:18.360> really<00:03:18.780> helped<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.260> blow<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:20.130> water

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
rocks really helped to blow the water

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:28.360 
rocks really helped to blow the water
out<00:03:21.330> through<00:03:21.720> my<00:03:21.870> yard

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.979 

so<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.819> where<00:03:30.060> we<00:03:30.180> are<00:03:30.209> now

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
so this is where we are now

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.920 
so this is where we are now
