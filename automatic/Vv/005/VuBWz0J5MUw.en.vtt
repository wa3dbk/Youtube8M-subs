00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to the photo SchÃ¤tzel 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.759
 today there is lenting again 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 a second part in the end must today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.690
 want to steel photography or the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490
 animal welfare fatah coffee we are straight 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.380
 in toom Baumarkt and find no 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 steel wool we want steelworks 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 So what makes the state would need 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.810
 and I hope this is that tico tico 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:45.930
 do it also hope that burns otherwise 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:47.879
 I have to keep looking for steel wool 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 photography what could you not for it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.690
 others need steel wool here as the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.030
 thick 000 so that's the finest fat 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.250
 which you can have so to 0 I would 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.039
 recommend that you frequent enough that one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.090
 it can also be well separated the next 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.580
 we need something where we have the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 steel wool can catch in there now 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 we just have one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.930
 Construction built because the better 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 as a whisk, we also know why 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.990
 not exactly but we just have 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 no money for whisk but if you are 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.540
 For real money you have to buy one 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 whisk or claudio of hers 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.560
 mother into the rope needs also still 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.220
 then it could jump around nicely 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.220
 and a lighter 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.870
 In addition, now we have the steel 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.030
 roll we took 200 grams that 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.010
 should actually be enough if you have 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.840
 Try to do with it and completely 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.430
 important no additives something 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.869
 either the band exploded 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.840
 not just a stall 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.210
 now we have to whisk this or 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.860
 prohibit our replacement with the rope 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.900
 that we can escape it 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 you have to be careful not to do that 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.200
 right there is wanted by betty separate 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.789
 So it gets a bit away from that 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.420
 saarland race because otherwise there 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.520
 it what we do best yet against the 16 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.649
 then worked for the iss 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.239
 she wanted to make it very clear 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.730
 because for the technicians is among you 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.350
 also very much surface that is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.790
 also time burns and by that we had 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.730
 more surface is more reactive it is 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.250
 then make it as a gift, too 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.090
 such a tear and then, little 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.090
 here 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.850
 a lot of sparks on steel wool 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.530
 We would like to produce you to theirs 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.030
 do not offer your own security 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.490
 use flammable clients 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.140
 to cover your hair or in the main 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.170
 for example, by a cap or 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.460
 Hood to turn a protective cover and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.090
 if possible also gloves 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.590

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.380
 camera settings 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.360

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.670
