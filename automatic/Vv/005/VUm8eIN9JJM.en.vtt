00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.059
 the flight was very helpful first 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.770
 Of course the territory is huge and it is very 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.270
 valuable that is, we have once again confirmed 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.550
 we learned about it but it again 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.859
 confirmed the second that I am very 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.140
 I was pleased that there is much less 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.449
 people and virtually no livestock that is 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.329
 so here is this potential conflict 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.119
 which could be with the release of tigers 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.640
 after a few years, he generally reduces 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.010
 minimized now that there 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.110
 I think not much comparative work 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 with a very limited number of friends 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.760
 we will be able to completely disable the possible 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.770
 future conflicts especially as tigers 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.750
 my next five years to deliver is not exactly 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.180
 will they be delivered later when 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.270
 the territory will be ready as for 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.260
 the state of the territory is good 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.300
 that is, the forest 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.220
 vegetation there is all good but 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.470
 Of course few animals that is, we are here for 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.050
 four hours of flight we saw three times 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.910
 the boar of all trails was true a lot but 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.369
 boars themselves after all or only three times this 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.649
 Of course, very little is there 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.240
 big job because the strength 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:15.640
 boars will appear at least I think 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.329
 Well, 50 times the rouge minimum and maybe 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.759
 be and more 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.039
 and of course you need to have Bukhara 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.469
 deer as the second main species which 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.210
 which will be 15 grams non-standard 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.950
 situations of large predators of course with 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.310
 can never be ruled out but you can 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.149
 do so and practically will not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.850
 almost everywhere where the tiger lives 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.249
 high population density incomparable 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.999
 quite with what we saw today 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:41.350
 in the far east of russia in china 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.700
 southeast asia in india 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.009
 that is, everywhere population density 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.109
 tall and people are quite normal 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.549
 well they get on there network Thunder 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.679
 of course a conflict situation but they 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.899
 often so here i think that we 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.549
 do everything to the maximum in order to 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.439
 how are such conflict situations 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.240
 prevent and most importantly of course 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.219
 it's good enough food base 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.509
 when the game is a good feed base him 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.100
 absolutely not interested where either 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.109
 go beyond that territory on 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.999
 which he dwells for those tiger which 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.390
 we will bring from Amur tigers 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.349
 and now the question is being solved 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.220
 it is possible that we will use 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.330
 tigers both from nature and from bondage and 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.120
 it's a tiger that used to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.010
 because in the snow, that is, this is nothing 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.320
 new not for myself in this case 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.640
 here will not see prey too for them 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.370
 habitually it is a large deer 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.560
 Duck whose subspecies is Bukhara 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 a deer is a boar thats those that is those 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.670
 kinds of which is his self on 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.740
 far east in this regard nothing 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.480
 there will not be a special new horse 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.340
 slightly different but I think that here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.400
 no problem getting comfortable with that 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 the tiger comes down will not be the basis was 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.970
 taken that huge job which its 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.520
 time led 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.490
 outstanding Kazakhstani scientist tiger 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.860
 years arch itself Slutsky who first 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.610
 time raised the question of what 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.290
 can you save the Turin his you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.530
 passionate voice fifty third year 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 which he voiced and for many years spoke in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.790
 that time was not heard we will lose 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.190
 trance turns not only Kazakhstan 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.580
 the world community lost from the Ural 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.430
 like 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:20.219
 disappeared and when we talk scientists 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.150
 an international group of scientists was 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:28.120
 proved that it was proven that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.510
 cytogenetic parameters of the Ussuri 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.230
 tiger 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.599
 very close to trans disappeared 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.909
 tiger then there was a question on we took something 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.349
 do here for a few years 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.500
 World Wildlife Fund 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.980
 leading feline scientists 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.010
 groups 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.120
 scientists of our institute we will since 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.099
 discussed and talked 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.099
 and came to the conclusion that you can start
