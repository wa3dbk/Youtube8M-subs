00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
electric start it's not been started

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
electric start it's not been started
probably<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.719> hours<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:59.010> let's<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.370> what

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
probably in two hours so let's see what

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:23.080 
probably in two hours so let's see what
goes<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:01.699> yeah<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.090> thought

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.180 

and<00:01:24.090> idols<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.700> was<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:28.190> five

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
and idols good I was right at five

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:41.859 
and idols good I was right at five
thousand<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.510> bit<00:01:30.630> more

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.600 

so<00:01:42.869> there's<00:01:43.110> 2,000<00:01:43.740> miles<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.399> sort

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
so there's 2,000 miles on that this sort

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.649 
so there's 2,000 miles on that this sort
