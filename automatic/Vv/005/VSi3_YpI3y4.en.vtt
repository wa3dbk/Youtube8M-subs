00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
really hoping develops at the end of the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.490 
really hoping develops at the end of the

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.719 
whatever becomes shield in the Marvel
Cinematic<00:01:43.689> Universe<00:01:44.140> shield<00:01:44.890> was<00:01:45.100> created<00:01:45.609> as

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
Cinematic Universe shield was created as

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.370 
Cinematic Universe shield was created as
a<00:01:45.759> separate<00:01:46.210> organization<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.020> they<00:01:47.259> just

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
a separate organization and they just

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.469 
a separate organization and they just
kind<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.590> rolled<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.920> SSR<00:01:48.399> into<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.880> so

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
kind of rolled the SSR into that so

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:50.700 
kind of rolled the SSR into that so
hopefully<00:01:49.600> we'll<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.079> at<00:01:50.140> some<00:01:50.200> point<00:01:50.320> and

episode<00:02:54.740> when<00:02:54.950> when<00:02:55.190> they<00:02:55.310> found<00:02:55.520> out<00:02:55.610> about

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
episode when when they found out about

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.400 
episode when when they found out about
the<00:02:55.880> weapon<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.240> mass<00:02:56.330> destruction<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.140> kind

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the weapon of mass destruction that kind

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.170 
the weapon of mass destruction that kind
of<00:02:57.500> seemed<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.190> end<00:02:58.340> game<00:02:58.520> but<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:59.000> think

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
of seemed like the end game but I think

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.520 
of seemed like the end game but I think
that<00:02:59.270> they're<00:02:59.390> also<00:02:59.570> after<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.200> Captain

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
that they're also after the Captain

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.600 
that they're also after the Captain
America<00:03:00.590> blood<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.130> they<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.370> make<00:03:01.459> their<00:03:01.580> own

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
America blood so they can make their own

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.970 
America blood so they can make their own
army<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.270> super<00:03:02.540> soldiers<00:03:02.690> they<00:03:03.500> ended<00:03:03.800> things

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
army of super soldiers they ended things

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.380 
army of super soldiers they ended things
in<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> way<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.550> made<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.730> seem<00:03:04.940> like<00:03:04.970> Peggy's

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
in a way that made it seem like Peggy's

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.330 
in a way that made it seem like Peggy's
in<00:03:05.540> deep<00:03:06.020> but<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.350> do<00:03:06.500> think<00:03:06.830> that<00:03:07.040> agent

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
in deep but I do think that agent

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.949 
in deep but I do think that agent
Sousa<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.700> agent<00:03:08.030> Thompson<00:03:08.240> will<00:03:08.570> help<00:03:08.780> her

Sousa and agent Thompson will help her

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
there's only two episodes left so it's

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.070 
there's only two episodes left so it's
not<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.180> they're<00:03:11.300> gonna<00:03:11.390> wait<00:03:11.660> till<00:03:11.930> like

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
not like they're gonna wait till like

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.410 
not like they're gonna wait till like
the<00:03:12.290> last<00:03:12.560> 10<00:03:12.890> minutes<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> final<00:03:14.030> episode

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420

for them to finally believe her and go

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.740 
for them to finally believe her and go
after<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.310> villain<00:03:16.610> but<00:03:17.120> they<00:03:17.270> still<00:03:17.570> don't
