why<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.050> kickboxing<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:26.160> actual<00:00:26.580> real<00:00:27.170> bags

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
why is kickboxing with actual real bags

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.250

so<00:00:28.740> popular<00:00:29.189> right<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.810> think<00:00:30.810> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so popular right now I think that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
so popular right now I think that
kickboxing<00:00:32.189> allows<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.030> muscles

kickboxing allows you to work muscles

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.940 
kickboxing allows you to work muscles
that<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.960> normally<00:00:34.140> work<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.770> have

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that you don't normally work and we have

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.740 
that you don't normally work and we have
ten<00:00:35.219> trainers<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.790> nine<00:00:36.059> or<00:00:36.180> ten<00:00:36.329> trainers

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
ten trainers here nine or ten trainers

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
ten trainers here nine or ten trainers
and<00:00:36.960> everyone's<00:00:37.320> completely<00:00:37.829> different<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and everyone's completely different so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.000
