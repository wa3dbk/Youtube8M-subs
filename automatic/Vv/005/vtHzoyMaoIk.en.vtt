00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.210
 of coins 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.620
 and if he does not deny melo 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.189
 hello all kids welcome one day 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.720
 more to my channel today I bring you a video 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.460
 something different I will not bring a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.860
 team neither opening envelopes nor a 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.860
 tournament or anything like that today I'm going to 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.840
 bring some possible players that are going to 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.550
 get out apps that you want to tell the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610
 players which are making a 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.470
 very good season and then she goes to 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.750
 do better what you are going to do is improve 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.300
 your letters and raise them a bit because your 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.739
 valuation because because as I'm already 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.930
 saying they have done and are making a 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.420
 very good season and opinion of the people and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.040
 they themselves think that the letter 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.449
 that you were assigned because it is not the correct one and 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.299
 It is not what it deserves but it is 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.949
 deserves to have some more points before 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.989
 start before you start talking about the 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.839
 players which I think are going to 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.850
 have this letter I want to tell you and I want 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.710
 recommend you the channel of putis which 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
 you will have in the description because if not 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.270
 out by the this video would not be so 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
 nice since it has helped me a lot 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.350
 the theme of photoshop and all this makes 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.290
 that makes the video so it's more 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.759
 pretty visually and all that we're going 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.530
 I leave your channel in the description he 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.940
 also fifa goes up and other things the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.890
 which we may be interested in 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.400
 Look, let's start talking to the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.290
 players 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600
 to tell you if you like it if you like it 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.090
 what I'm going to show you like 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.170
 because it's something that helps me a lot 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.990
 let's start talking for the first 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.670
 player this is david de gea player the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.010
 which is doing a very very season 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.720
 very very good already has two and efe its 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.450
 original letter the letter with which 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.550
 came out the fifa is 1,083 and I think that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.580
 after this they will put a half 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.880
 of 85 since his last boss was that 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.440
 of 1,085 the one who does not know 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.960
 how this player right now will go to 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.290
 have 85 on average according to my 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.290
 criterion 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.640
 forgive for the cough you know I'm 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.680
 a little bad throat according to my 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.720
 criterion this is something that I am 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 pulling out of the sleeve like it comes out but 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.550
 It does not come out with the media which I am 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.710
 giving comes out simply with 84 but let's go 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.110
 what I'm going to do if this player is 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.330
 came out with this mean with an average 85 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.520
 your letter and your letters and bosses would go up 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.320
 one more point I want to say then that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320
 the first and efe would happen to have a 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.180
 mean of 86 and elche and the second which 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.330
 now it has an average of 85 would happen to 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.590
 have an average of 87 there is already a youtuber 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.240
 which is called tobal which has 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.740
 explained I will leave the link in the 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.440
 description who wants to know well 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.990
 and soak a little bit of what the matter is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.550
 and nothing kids this is for me the 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.350
 version of de gea that can reach 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.270
 take out and for me a player who has 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.520
 quite enough chips to come out 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.170
 let's move on to the second player which 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.510
 I think it's going to take away 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.810
 bring this this app this is antonio 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.930
 griezmann good both antoine griezmann 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.140
 in French as well you see also has 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.520
 two bosses and his original letter is 82 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.770
 I think the average rise is 83 83 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.370
 84 I really do not have it completely clear 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.810
 everything could be and well there they are 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.030
 some stockings which I think that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.740
 you can put this player to be that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.230
 whether they are exact or not, I am telling you that it is very 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.930
 difficult to be exact but good I 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.250
 I leave them there and see if I already see if 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.770
 come out 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.600
 as you can see you have two bosses the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.810
 which for the said thing will go up a point to 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.880
 each one because in case you get this up 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.650
 of course we are going to move on to the third 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.600
 player this as you see we already changed a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.950
 little does not have two and if it does not have one 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.860
 but he's doing a season 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.310
 spectacular has gone from being one of the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.170
 Real Madrid players more important 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.510
 this beetle to the player which 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.820
 he started with an average of 79 or his 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.610
 original letter is 79 pulled out a uni 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 efe of media 80 but I think that this 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.090
 player and will even have more media 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.720
 280 because the one who is doing it very 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.720
 very very good 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.500
 as you see, I have put 84 of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.010
 rhythm because I think it's something that is 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.600
 well 82 of defense and 84 of physical is a 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.160
 very complete player and how they take it out 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.990
 so the truth is that the boss will go to 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.290
 be a player and a player that 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.440
 wants him to perform very well in the league in 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.299
 the one in the bv to go to 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.490
 move to another player this is the cassette 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.130
 player that we were almost signed from 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.590
 that will come up because it will come out 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.590
 why is he doing it 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.590
 Awesome 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.770
 is making it awesome this 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.539
 player in the one in which he is being 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.910
 some most important forwards of all 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.430
 the league has two bosses and I think that 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.840
 they will put the average of 81 and the letters 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.030
 and efe are going to raise a bestiality 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.580
 they will even be worth their gold price because 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.190
 They will be great if this player goes up 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.289
 of 81 going to have some states that can 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.150
 that can be little things the truth is that 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.639
 if we are going to go for other players 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.710
 you cisco another player that as you can see 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.810
 He has two bosses and he has earned 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.150
 many points to have your 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.669
 letter up I have put the letter 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.500
 that will be taken out will average 85 and there 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.370
 you see the stands your letter right now from 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.330
 83 in the offensive midfielder I think that 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.900
 you can upload those two points 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.870
 easily and care for the last boss 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.580
 because it will have an average of 87 if 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.130
 this people that there is complete 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.199
 bought some some discs 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.659
 just in case the truth comes out that 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.220
 can get a lot of pasta we're going to 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.150
 move to one of the bets that I have 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.150
 taken out of my sleeve 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.380
 this is the player who plays in the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.100
 tottenham which if I 'm not wrong 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.080
 he scored two goals at chelsea the day he was 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.370
 they won more than one they put a 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.500
 Manita is a player who did not expect 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.270
 He was not expected to give him a 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.530
 performance so good but the truth that 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.480
 he's doing pretty well in league 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.510
 apart from that party plays quite 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.280
 It performs very well and I think you already know 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.070
 this player right now is an idol for 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.080
 many English and why not I think that 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.020
 yes you can get one perfectly 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.180
 and if it's not 71 they could put it up 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.280
 of 74 because I have to what is 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.990
 doing very well now let's move on 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.810
 for the last one and for me I think the one 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:20.190
 more ball can hit this is alexis 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.190
 sanchez player which 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.290
 sorry again for the voice but that 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.300
 I'm pretty pretty annoyed this 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.340
 is alexis sanchez as well you see I have 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.230
 since you can go up to 86 already 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.710
 that his last boss is this average 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.080
 86 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.390
 if this player comes out I tell you that the 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.340
 bosses are going to cost more than a million 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.250
 because it's that the last boss who is 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.730
 mean 86 would reach average 88 and that's 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.370
 a bestiality hopefully hopefully 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.650
 let's have a 788 law of average would be a 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.850
 pelotazo is difficult yes it is difficult 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.970
 but just like last year it came out 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.640
 hazard and it came up on an average of 91 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:03.090
 that seems like nonsense but 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.890
 got to have a head of media 91 hazard 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.350
 Alexis can perfectly reach 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.050
 have a boss of average 88 I do not see it 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.120
 no exaggeration these are some of 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.760
 those of the players which I believe 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.320
 that they will have a letter up I hope that 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.570
 you liked the video that I 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.960
 comment if you believe that some 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.310
 another player deserves to have this card 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.900
 what to say below in the description 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.970
 you have a page of coins in the 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.210
 which are 14 euros a million 14 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.770
 euros the million of playstation 4 and the one of 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.780
 kids with this I say goodbye again 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.060
 thanks putis down if you 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.130
 you want to inform more about the change of 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.230
 the bosses when the apps come 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.830
 I'll leave the video of tobal and kids 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.430
 until another 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.430
 goodbye
