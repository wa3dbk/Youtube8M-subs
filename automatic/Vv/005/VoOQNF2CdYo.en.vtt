00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 Hello everyone, Mikhail Zuev is the author and 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.320
 host blog mastercard dot com and in 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.350
 today's video I want to tell you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760
 how to make an operating system 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.240
 windows 8 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.420
 as usual as we saw 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 windows 7 and windows vista since 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.949
 release windows 8 has passed very little 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.160
 time but during this period it became clear 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.010
 those users who consider windows 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.460
 8 uncomfortable consider it as such 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.649
 because she lost her habitual very 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.620
 the usual element of the start button if 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 she used to be the whole paradigm of working with 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.750
 the operating system was conducted precisely from 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.410
 it is in the eight she died is not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.300
 reason to roll back to seven 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.010
 because there is a program that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 released by stardock 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 she's called start8 and she returns 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 familiar start menu in windows 8 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
 you can watch her now 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 looks like a link to download this 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.150
 the program will be under this video which 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.250
 you are watching the program is not free but 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.549
 she costs only 5 dollars what little 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.950
 more than 150 rubles and has no limit 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.310
 by duration of use 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.380
 its key difference from all the others 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.869
 programs created for windows 8 which 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.020
 called to return the start button this then 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.590
 that start8 completely imitates everything 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.659
 functions normal start menu 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.740
 you don't even see the badge in 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.380
 system tray 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.119
 she works as a service and say the word 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.400
 consumes very few system resources 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.250
 about 500 kilobytes 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.220
 it starts immediately and at startup 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.369
 windows 8 and you can click on the button 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.070
 a start which was not here before means 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.390
 and is available all the same features such 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.049
 like shutdown 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.140
 and sleep mode and so on just as well 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.320
 All programs are displayed. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.969
 absolutely changes everything in its usual form 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.940
 as she was in the operating system 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:16.030
 windows 7 and windows vista 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.100
 here as the most 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 which search window is so lacking 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.400
 windows 8 to call it is necessary 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 go to normal windows 8 in the world in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 window start select search and so on 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.190
 here just click let it look 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 means and hence the principle of access to all 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:42.190
 places like my computer so panel 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:45.040
 controls are also here that is all in 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.840
 principle as it should about the menu itself and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.120
 I will not tell you only 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 said it is completely identical 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.640
 one in windows 7 let's see 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 settings because there is something there 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.330
 interesting that can be useful just 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.550
 click the start button 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.590
 right click to configure 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.120
 start8 opens this window where you are 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.410
 You can choose how it will be 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.660
 look your start menu 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.760
 Classic style is selected by default. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.800
 windows 7 can do windows 8 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.230
 the start screen is displayed in the most 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.180
 menu well i find it not interesting and 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.520
 very uncomfortable therefore 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.110
 click windows 7 style no 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.540
 apply hands do not have to press all 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.170
 apply automatically and immediately we can 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.940
 see the change here we can 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.600
 In addition to these two, select other topics. 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.730
 for example a rounded theme is a combination 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.930
 start menu design from windows 7 and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.320
 windows 8 click as you see here 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.320
 buttons are more oval as they were in 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:52.690
 seven if someone is used to this topic 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.810
 windows 7 fully copied as 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.269
 see yes the one-to-one menu reminds 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.870
 windows 7 so we still have 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.560
 solid solid menu windows 7 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.650
 honestly not clear what's the difference 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.690
 so with black borders 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.900
 standard windows 8 just a little 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.760
 differently designed so here is the principle 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.040
 all but i choose my default in 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.310
 principle like this here is square 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.780
 windows 8 style buttons and so on yes 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.150
 by the way I want to say right away that 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.440
 if you remember earlier all new 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.810
 installed programs in the menu 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.520
 highlighted here is this feature like you 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.700
 see it is saved that is very convenient 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.780
 can quickly find a program that 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.910
 recently installed 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.160
 what the start button should look like 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.770
 default here is the flag image you 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.650
 You can choose start8 logo or 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.610
 choose another and there is a certain 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.310
 library someone here will find native 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.250
 start button from windows xp 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.180
 it can also be used though of course I 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.970
 she is already tired for many years therefore I 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.120
 I prefer just flag further in the menu 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.040
 settings here can also be customized 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 such parameters as from user 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.300
 menu large icons 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.730
 if we remove this item then the icons 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.160
 will be fine as well as in windows 7 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.690
 however, there were also such points 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.280
 Settings and whether to highlight 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.460
 recently installed applications and 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.060
 display recently used 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.640
 programs 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.090
 but in principle what hands to place in 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.160
 the right column means this here 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.960
 the default column here is all that was 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.810
 windows 7 you can add some 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.300
 elements let folder 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:45.530
 administration add or folder 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.539
 network yes and so on so button action 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.450
 power supply here is set by default 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.130
 meaning power button 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.260
 data shutdown here you can 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.090
 change so but here because all 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.460
 clearly move on in the management 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.810
 here you can assign a start button 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.780
 opened the start8 menu or the same menu 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.320
 windows 8 by the way if you are concerned about the issue 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:13.910
 about where did you go in general 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.180
 standard windows 8 screen then 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.669
 there is no active left lower corner 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.979
 here only the start menu of the active right 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.910
 corners you can open the panel principle 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.380
 and everything will be available here 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.600
 all the same interface question only in 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.690
 the fact that now he is not the main 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.090
 now you have a start button so but 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.710
 back to settings 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.940
 here I also immediately noted the points that 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.390
 windows key 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.030
 opens the start8 menu the same key 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.900
 windows on the keyboard does not open the window 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.800
 windows 8 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.440
 and the start menu, that is, the start menu , but also 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.830
 basically a desk 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.720
 here I noted only such a point very 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.729
 interesting to me it is very convenient 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.020
 It seemed at the entrance automatically 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.150
 go to desktop 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.060
 because if you use windows 8 then 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.360
 know that as soon as you reboot 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.880
 computer or just turn on the computer 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.010
 the system boots and opens you here 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.440
 this one is windows 8 screen 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.599
 I do n't need it because I use 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.169
 its on the desktop in principle 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:23.330
 uncomfortable so if you answer 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:24.919
 This item go directly to the worker 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.830
 the table will open right away 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:30.470
 familiar desktop bypassing all this 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.840
 not clear interface and by the way here 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.940
 you can turn off these hottest corners 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.550
 for example the lower right which 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.289
 opens hell toll panel yes it all 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.150
 you can turn it off and then you even completely 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:45.310
 forget that you are running windows 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:49.280
 8 since its tiled interface 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.900
 will be completely hidden from your gaze well 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.270
 and in principle these are all programs 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.460
 automatically searches sets 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.450
 update if you are licensed 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.729
 user then they will 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:02.030
 installed in the background without 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:03.800
 of all your participation, well that's all 

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.050
 Thank you very much for your attention with you 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.440
 Mikhail Zuev mastercard block com
