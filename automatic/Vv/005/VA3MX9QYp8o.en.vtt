okay now we put the mail roughly in
position<00:01:43.810> it's<00:01:44.810> worth<00:01:44.960> checking<00:01:44.990> with<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
position it's worth checking with the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.270 
position it's worth checking with the
other<00:01:46.190> bits<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.700> there<00:01:47.230> which<00:01:48.230> we've<00:01:48.800> we're

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
other bits on there which we've we're

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.460 
other bits on there which we've we're
going<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.490> use<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> V<00:01:49.910> for<00:01:50.150> tonight<00:01:50.510> home<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
going to use a V for tonight home and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.930 
going to use a V for tonight home and
it's<00:01:51.590> worth<00:01:51.740> checking<00:01:51.770> before<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.670> do<00:01:52.820> the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's worth checking before you do the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.170 
it's worth checking before you do the
ball<00:01:53.090> out<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.680> position<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.430> of<00:01:55.670> where

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
ball out that the position of of where

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.210 
ball out that the position of of where
the<00:01:56.360> Miller<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.320> going<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.500> go<00:01:57.590> back<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:58.010> and

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
the Miller is going to go back in and

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.430 
the Miller is going to go back in and
that<00:01:58.910> is<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.600> right<00:01:59.810> because<00:02:00.260> obviously

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
that is is about right because obviously

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.230 
that is is about right because obviously
when<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:00.890> do<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.100> bolt<00:02:01.310> up<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.880> put<00:02:02.090> this

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
when you do the bolt up and you put this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.119 
when you do the bolt up and you put this
in<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:03.170> can't<00:02:03.410> do<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.680> back<00:02:03.800> up<00:02:03.950> again<00:02:03.979> so
