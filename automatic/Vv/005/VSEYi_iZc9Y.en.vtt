00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 Welcome back to my channel toys 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:13.760
 for kids today I will make this bracelet 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.830
 in English it's called facebook and in Spanish 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.710
 some call it fishtail or 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.080
 fishbone is very pretty and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 simple to do to me has stayed very 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.140
 colorful because I used these 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.050
 Gummies that are two colors and is for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 that has many colors my bracelet 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.010
 but actually use 12 gummies 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 green 12 yellow and 12 blue this 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.359
 we can make it with two bracelets 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.730
 pens or markers also with a 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.100
 Clothes hook does not matter next 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 wood or plastic and we can also 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.320
 to do with my fingers I made a bracelet 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.510
 with your fingers but in the end hurt a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.059
 little fingers from so much getting and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.179
 taking out the gummies so I prefer 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.000
 do it with this rock hook I'm going to 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.540
 start putting a gummie 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.760
 on this side 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 I keep like this and a turn 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.680
 and placed it on the other end now 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.180
 I have a lot 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.909
 or an X in the center like this 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.299
 I will continue to place this 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.760
 what is yellow and blue I'm going to 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.840
 place 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.000
 a bad day I'll leave a little bit this and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.410
 I'm going to place the next gummy that is 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.510
 the blue now I'm going to take the last one 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.880
 food that I have put that is the green 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.190
 The more extreme I am going to place my 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.790
 finger here in the center so that we 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.860
 are giving gummies I will pass this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.300
 gumdrop down to the center and I'm going to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.990
 do the same thing from the other side 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.120
 here he took the pretty one and I step towards the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.400
 Now I have the green rubber band 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.650
 the center that means that it touches me 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.890
 the green rubber band put it up 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.440
 now I have again three meals in the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.840
 I'm going to take the hook like we did the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.020
 first time I'm going to take the last the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.080
 step for the center we're going the same thing 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.480
 other side 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.870
 and now I have a yellow rubber band here 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.170
 in the center then what is the gummy 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.620
 that we have to put up here 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.560
 You can make yellow median 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.790
 colors that you want 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.790
 or one color 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:49.130
 and now I'm going to take this gummy and I'm going 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.080
 to place here in the center 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.210
 I'm going to fill this up a bit 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.910
 well and I will continue working as in 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:03.040
 the center of no the blue gummy I have 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.040
 to put a blue gumdrop up here 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.610
 like the last rubber band and he went down to the 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.610
 center now I have to place a green 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.450
 and this is all the time until 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.200
 finish making the bracelet length 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.140
 what you want as you see is not complicated is 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.550
 very very easy I have not invented this 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.220
 bracelet 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.980
 there are many videos of how to do this 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.900
 bracelet but I wanted to show you that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.540
 you can make these bracelets with 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.390
 pens with hooks for hanging clothes 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.370
 with your fingers with what you have 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.710
 at hand now here I have the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.210
 yellow in the center I will place a 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:52.170
 yellow rubber band 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.820
 so I'm going to take the last gummy and the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.820
 I'm going to move towards the center 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.410
 where to continue loving down and 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.930
 we continue doing the same until 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.620
 finish the bracelet or get to the size 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.620

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.650
 I'm not going to stay doing all the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.030
 process of the bracelet if you want 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.180
 keep watching the video can give you 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.400
 back and can see how they are made 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.050
 from the beginning it is the same step 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.030
 I will always finish doing this 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.280

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.710

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.450
 I'm going to put the last gummie that 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.450

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.250

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.250

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.180

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.560

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.940
 minutes in doing them since it is very 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.490
