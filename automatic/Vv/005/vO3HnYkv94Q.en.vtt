at<00:02:23.120> all<00:02:23.239> in<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.569> first<00:02:23.780> game<00:02:23.989> there's<00:02:24.590> been

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
at all in the first game there's been

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.229 
at all in the first game there's been
some<00:02:25.010> mixed<00:02:25.310> opinions<00:02:25.730> about<00:02:25.849> the<00:02:26.090> new

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
some mixed opinions about the new

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.240 
some mixed opinions about the new
interface<00:02:26.660> but<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> personally<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.130> be

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
interface but I personally like it to be

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
interface but I personally like it to be
honest<00:02:28.580> actually<00:02:29.150> like<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.660> game<00:02:29.810> looks

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
honest actually like that the game looks

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.080 
honest actually like that the game looks
completely<00:02:30.680> different<00:02:31.190> than<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> first<00:02:31.760> one

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
completely different than the first one

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.309 
completely different than the first one
it<00:02:32.239> makes<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.480> feel<00:02:32.690> like<00:02:32.840> you're<00:02:33.019> having<00:02:33.110> a

it makes you feel like you're having a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:44.120 
it makes you feel like you're having a
whole<00:02:33.500> new<00:02:33.830> experience

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.230 

now<00:02:45.130> let's<00:02:45.340> take<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.550> look<00:02:45.790> at<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> first

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
made to all of them this might look like

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.650 
made to all of them this might look like
some<00:02:57.190> plain<00:02:57.430> old<00:02:57.640> regular<00:02:57.820> Ryu<00:02:58.330> Shing

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
be beefed up with new moves even though

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.410

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
but if you take into consideration
