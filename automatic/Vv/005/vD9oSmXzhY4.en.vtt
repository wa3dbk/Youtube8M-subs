00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
in fact our beloved astronauts

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
in fact our beloved astronauts
experienced<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.940> 90%<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> Earth's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
experienced about 90% of the Earth's
gravity<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> why<00:01:00.090> are<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.329> floating<00:01:00.780> around

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
gravity so why are they floating around

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.640 
gravity so why are they floating around
so<00:01:01.260> effortlessly<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.309> most<00:01:02.730> peculiar<00:01:03.270> way

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
so effortlessly in a most peculiar way

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.840 
so effortlessly in a most peculiar way
shouldn't<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.739> fall<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.280> bottom<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
space station shouldn't the whole space

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
space station shouldn't the whole space
station<00:01:08.220> crash<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> ground<00:01:09.020> quickly<00:01:10.020> to

station crash to the ground quickly to
the<00:01:11.040> internet<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.580> our<00:01:11.640> dramatic<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.240> creepy

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the internet for our dramatic and creepy

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
the internet for our dramatic and creepy
Twilight<00:01:13.049> Zone<00:01:13.290> style<00:01:13.770> ending<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.820> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Twilight Zone style ending when we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
Twilight Zone style ending when we
realized<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> book<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.560> actually

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
realized that the book was actually

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.870 
realized that the book was actually
titled<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> cook<00:01:18.810> 40<00:01:19.350> humans<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
titled how to cook 40 humans we have to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.300 
titled how to cook 40 humans we have to
tell<00:01:21.060> someone

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
tell someone

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
tell someone
according<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> our<00:01:23.610> math<00:01:23.970> these<00:01:24.360> astronauts

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
according to our math these astronauts

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.679 
according to our math these astronauts
aren't<00:01:25.259> floating<00:01:26.220> they're<00:01:26.939> falling<00:01:27.540> they're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
aren't floating they're falling they're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.270 
aren't floating they're falling they're
falling<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:29.030> roll<00:01:30.030> credits

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
falling and roll credits

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.910 
falling and roll credits
so<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> real<00:01:32.610> twist<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.960> NASA<00:01:34.409> knew

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so the real twist was that NASA knew

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.120 
so the real twist was that NASA knew
this<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.460> along<00:01:36.530> what<00:01:37.530> looks<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.740> zero

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this all along what looks like zero

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.420 
this all along what looks like zero
gravity<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.750> weightlessness<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
gravity is actually weightlessness and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
gravity is actually weightlessness and
you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.909> weightlessness

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
you can get weightlessness

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.620 
you can get weightlessness
whenever<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.770> falling<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:45.240> know<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
whenever you're falling you know that

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
whenever you're falling you know that
feeling<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.259> crest<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.710> hill<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
feeling when you crest a hill on a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.219 
feeling when you crest a hill on a
roller<00:01:47.369> coaster<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.899> elevator

roller coaster or just as the elevator

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
roller coaster or just as the elevator
starts<00:01:49.560> moving<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
starts moving down that's you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.950 
starts moving down that's you
experiencing<00:01:52.320> decreased<00:01:53.189> weight<00:01:53.869> jump<00:01:54.869> out

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.069 
and you left off the side of the tower
now<00:02:59.019> you'd<00:02:59.799> still<00:03:00.069> be<00:03:00.099> falling<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> earth

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
now you'd still be falling but the earth

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.120 
now you'd still be falling but the earth
is<00:03:02.410> falling<00:03:02.829> away<00:03:02.980> at<00:03:03.310> exactly<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.269> same<00:03:04.569> rate

so<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:06.190> never<00:03:06.579> actually<00:03:07.000> hit<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.599> ground<00:03:08.220> now

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
so you never actually hit the ground now
