studio based in Helsinki Finland we have

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.290 
studio based in Helsinki Finland we have
been<00:00:50.910> around<00:00:51.059> for<00:00:51.660> over<00:00:52.559> 10<00:00:53.190> years<00:00:53.300> during

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
been around for over 10 years during

been around for over 10 years during
that<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.260> developed<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:55.800> 100

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that time we have developed over 100

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.490 
that time we have developed over 100
games<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.600> seen<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.110> we<00:00:58.320> will

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
games and we have seen that we will

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.579 
games and we have seen that we will
never<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.430> providing<00:01:00.300> kind<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.019> huge

never be providing kind of like huge
amounts<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> games<00:01:02.730> per<00:01:03.180> year<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
amounts of games per year they have to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.580 
amounts of games per year they have to
be<00:01:04.710> excellent<00:01:05.460> fun<00:01:05.729> games<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.050> that's<00:01:07.350> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
be excellent fun games and that's what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
be excellent fun games and that's what
we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.860> tried<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> push<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> boundaries<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we have tried to push the boundaries of

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.460 
we have tried to push the boundaries of

there<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.630> many<00:01:24.630> goals<00:01:25.050> for<00:01:25.890> example<00:01:25.979> if

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
there is many goals for example if

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.590 
there is many goals for example if
people<00:01:26.910> try<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.289> improve<00:01:28.289> it<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.940> try

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
people try to improve it you can try

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.460 
people try to improve it you can try
as<00:01:32.049> many<00:01:32.320> points<00:01:32.590> as<00:01:32.830> possible<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.509> product

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
as many points as possible the product

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.280 
as many points as possible the product
has<00:01:35.950> been<00:01:36.159> registered<00:01:36.820> as<00:01:37.180> possible<00:01:37.659> but

has been registered as possible but
basically<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:40.000> just<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.720> go<00:01:40.960> through

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
basically you just have to go through

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.760 
basically you just have to go through
interactive<00:01:43.240> as

the<00:01:46.640> physics<00:01:47.090> model<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:47.960> thrilling<00:01:48.320> highly

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
the physics model is thrilling highly

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.620 
the physics model is thrilling highly
developed<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.790> no<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:50.210> needs<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.540> know

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
developed but no one needs to know

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.719 
developed but no one needs to know
anything<00:01:51.229> about<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.829> it<00:01:52.100> says<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:52.340> when

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
anything about that it says that when

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.270 
anything about that it says that when
the<00:01:52.850> physics<00:01:53.240> model<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:53.990> good<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:55.100> can

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
the physics model is really good we can

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.990 
the physics model is really good we can
keep<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.850> gamescape<00:01:56.560> 106<00:01:57.560> 3<00:01:57.860> was<00:01:58.280> simple<00:01:58.820> you

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
keep the gamescape 106 3 was simple you

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.539 
keep the gamescape 106 3 was simple you
have<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.390> gas<00:01:59.710> brake<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.369> have

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
have like gas brake and then you have

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.609 
have like gas brake and then you have
lean<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:01.939> controls<00:02:02.420> but<00:02:02.720> we<00:02:02.899> use<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.259> motion

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
lean in controls but we use the motion

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.200 
lean in controls but we use the motion
controls<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.280> way<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.580> if<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.789> can

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
controls in the way that if you can

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.570 
controls in the way that if you can
sleep<00:02:05.570> over<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.259> keep<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.100> controller

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
sleep over it just keep that controller

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.410 
sleep over it just keep that controller
like<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.649> there's<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.880> main

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
like this and it is there's the main

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.240 
like this and it is there's the main
game<00:02:11.870> mode<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.319> where<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.920> beat<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
game mode is where you have to beat the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
game mode is where you have to beat the
ghost<00:02:13.489> so<00:02:13.849> if<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.239> if<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.569> get<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> bronze

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
ghost so if you if you get the bronze

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.890 
ghost so if you if you get the bronze
level<00:02:15.560> that's<00:02:16.099> kind<00:02:16.370> of<00:02:16.400> easiest<00:02:16.940> ghost<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
level that's kind of easiest ghost and

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.449 
level that's kind of easiest ghost and
comes<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.290> see<00:02:18.319> whether<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.069> kind<00:02:19.310> of

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
comes to see whether it's this kind of

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.520 
comes to see whether it's this kind of
medium<00:02:19.880> gold<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> gold<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.350> like

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
medium gold and then the gold is like

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.979 
medium gold and then the gold is like
ultimate<00:02:22.160> ghost<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> people<00:02:23.540> who<00:02:23.720> really

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
ultimate ghost for the people who really

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.500 
ultimate ghost for the people who really
kind<00:02:24.350> of<00:02:24.530> want<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.950> get<00:02:25.160> every<00:02:25.580> jump<00:02:25.910> right<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
kind of want to get every jump right and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.000 
kind of want to get every jump right and
you<00:02:26.690> know<00:02:26.959> when<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.319> go<00:02:27.560> on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
you know when you go on

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.990 
you know when you go on
you<00:02:28.880> always<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.950> finish<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.400> level<00:02:31.730> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
you always have to finish one level and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.070 
you always have to finish one level and
if<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.840> cannot<00:02:33.049> do<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.950> certain<00:02:34.610> time

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
if you cannot do that in certain time

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.309 
if you cannot do that in certain time
then<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.410> can<00:02:37.090> collect<00:02:38.500> hidden<00:02:39.500> times<00:02:40.459> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
then you can collect hidden times and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.900 
then you can collect hidden times and
use<00:02:42.319> this

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
use this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.370 
use this
