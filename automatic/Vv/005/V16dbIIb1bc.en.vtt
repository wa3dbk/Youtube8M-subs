00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.389
 second video from the test server of physics 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.219
 Tests that go until today 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.570
 I think on Monday we will be new 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 I do not get any information because I think so 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.550
 stop that on monday or stop 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 next days then already the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.630
 next test phase starts with others 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.250
 Maps and other vehicles and from 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 technical 100 is already technical 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.559
 the harder the tanks become the more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 I think it will be more interesting 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.890
 and in this video I'll give you a look 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.309
 briefly to report a few experiences 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.680
 from the training room I then 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.640
 have made and where would halt 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.450
 have tried everything so everything or more 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 less is possible and we are not 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 a few things I recorded and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 I'll just jump out of the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.550
 to talk and sit down there 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.480
 a few hopefully a few impressions 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.100
 can transmit 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 yes in advance are now much more 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.510
 possibilities give to position 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 get hold 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 straight and / or not necessarily 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 more positions open up but 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.799
 rather the speed of how to get to the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 position comes because yes comes in the meantime 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.590
 you relatively fix so small no trailer 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.390
 hold high or faster and give up 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.259
 it also has a different position 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.189
 now open up 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.320
 through this update and there I found but 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.790
 and four positions one way or the other 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 because it was just a bit hagg 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.439
 league had to be more careful and it was 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 usually a bit more difficult 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.220
 On the other hand, you come now too 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.340
 some positions with heavy armor 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.890
 So something higher in weight 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 armor where you ended up sooner 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.979
 to create the easy with scout 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.960
 Panzer arrived and that could 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.869
 change something I think that changes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.340
 mainly in the esl area or there 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.780
 remembers the most what stop team 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.800
 battles and so it was just more 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.670
 Possible after which herb 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.250
 mountains and that within 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.780
 thence chewed to normal gameplay 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.770
 I think it would not be that way because it 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 just not so yes owner though one 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.180
 good position but that's it again 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.980
 team based on it so if so 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.310
 the team then not the page anyway 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.330
 then it has so little sense so 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.400
 I think it's so harald thieme 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.890
 maybe old as for example 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.110
 There could also be some new options 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.820
 what stop position mainly think 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.430
 I'll take it otherwise fall murat i 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.340
 who quite fix studying extra niche 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.030
 The niche knows nothing about monasteries 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.910
 I still think in the bottom left corner 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.530
 in this plateau the base understood 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.280
 From time to time, he will be determined by Japan 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.900
 in it 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.740
 there is one more possibility now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.990
 left of the left side edge on quasi 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.760
 monastery there maybe again 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.900
 to go to see if that is the same with the old one 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.020
 I do not know yet worth it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.350
 or violent so can not be determined so 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.590
 because then not one of them could quite do you 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.660
 So dive so you could but it 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
 there is still some bad luck still 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.060
 be shot down from the outside without that 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.600
 the enemy that I actually yes too 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.450
 purely drives yes otherwise has 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.580
 of course the physical movement 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.260
 mostly pretty much changed and the 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.250
 handbrake is available now if it can exist 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.300
 you can do it faster and yourself 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.010
 I found now because it is 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.630
 getting used to but otherwise changes 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.640
 Not too much as it has 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.060
 strong win days for the people the mouse 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.459
 drive 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.780
 it will be really violent because of me 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.270
 think if we at with the mouse 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.590
 top speed is 20 and then brake 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.720
 then needs a few meters and 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.890
 if you eventually, maybe me 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 do not know maybe some play like that 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.110
 I think I make it subconscious 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.880
 so that i will stop if i am 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.200
 just around a corner where I know that is 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.560
 an opponent as I see just one already 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.080
 I push w and then leave effortlessly and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.300
 remember then shoot that will start 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.110
 next patch normal from the physics 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.510
 special 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.030
 get a little bit more complicated 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.709
 because if you just let it go velos 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.090
 then it may be that orban too easy 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.820
 that's how far he rolls that gap 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.140
 so you have to miss a special one 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.820
 squeeze me personally before me 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.590
 itself does not know if I press it or 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.340
 if I actually let go and once 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.110
 At the moment I am still very strong 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.640
 brakes full rows with the physics 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.360
 sketch does not do that to the holder anymore 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.280
 piece and around point or faster 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.200
 I have to slow down 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.380
 Not 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.720
 is just a change but otherwise 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.580
 just not as much more straight 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.840
 otherwise was control technology 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.100
 transitions on this appeared or 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.490
 something Feldmann much less km h 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.350
 if you go by when you jump 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.810
 or somehow dissolve something 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.180
 So google jumps that hard 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.890
 you also have to lose the chamber 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.340
 take care when you are certain 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.870
 position that makes big jumps 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.960
 I will get my human 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.940
 but because you finally 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.460
 eventually speed then loses 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.340
 Damage to the subject or so is also 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.900
 Another thing I have one 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.960
 test made with the tch and 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.780
 also another does not expect 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.580
 that's how much damage I take 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.500
 have now no test on normal room 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.330
 and can sure if that 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.140
 Panzer also flies normal at the time 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.280
 not quite so much deducted if 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.100
 I'm one hundred percent sure 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.690
 his sexuality instance if you stop 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.370
 so much on land transformed characterized 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.860
 you finally get like that 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.400
 human because I stop in the partners 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.190
 am very very strong landed on pan 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.410
 and at it almost all hps 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.790
 So he will be lost 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.650
 have to be careful 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:20.700
 On the other hand , nobody jumps like that 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.700
 hampered like me from this plateau 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.410
 otherwise the effects are pretty cool 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.849
 So now if you have a tank now 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.660
 She finally gets to know panzer again 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.660
 a little crazy 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.530
 These chains effect when he is directly at 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.890
 the floor a bit shoveled away 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.599
 becomes quasi and yes you can ultimately 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.610
 in the meantime a little bit over the tank 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:43.870
 because you can not do so in the end 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.760
 Like me, there is this tank 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.849
 drive if you just feel that way 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.289
 that it's almost the commissar armor 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.460
 would crush and then 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.710
 slower it goes apparently 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.440
 not it will possibly be moment 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.360
 but wide awake comes with a lot of momentum 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.840
 go over a tank over it 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.940
 in fact, and Egypt is just 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.410
 Unfortunately, sometimes when not test 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.820
 Really done unless we 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.470
 keep as jumped the 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:12.400
 tank because a bit of blood flew 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:15.550
 then we are there he overturned or 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.950
 Keep tower turned and came away 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.610
 not really gone anymore either 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.050
 could not be back 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.130
 but otherwise by raban graf hamas 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.610
 not yet as I looked 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:29.010
 the armor is the entrepreneur 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.090
 destroyed and I think that we over 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.770
 Stop testing a bit better 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.840
 if you can wait until finally all 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.370
 Panzer has available when that is 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.400
 I do not know, I can only speculate 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.920
 i can i imagine it 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.980
 after the test phase the second winter 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.270
 more tanks and maps or completely 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.760
 other tanks and not others 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.340
 Maps remains the client holding relatively 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.560
 small so far so good I thank you 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.810
 Do you manage that's it to the physics 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.310
 and I hope you have a nice one 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:01.430
 rest sunday will say until the next 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.430
 times
