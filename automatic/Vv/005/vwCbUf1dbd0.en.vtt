I<00:01:03.829> think<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.519> one<00:01:04.640> who<00:01:04.760> doesn't<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:05.330> have<00:01:05.630> it

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
I think the one who doesn't just have it

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.960 
I think the one who doesn't just have it
is<00:01:05.840> just<00:01:06.020> going<00:01:06.200> through<00:01:06.320> all<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.970> going

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
is just going through all the going

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.810 
is just going through all the going
through<00:01:08.119> all<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.479> little<00:01:09.010> flags<00:01:10.010> at<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.610> end

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
through all the little flags at the end

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.930 
through all the little flags at the end
of<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:12.800> should<00:01:12.890> be<00:01:12.950> fairly<00:01:13.280> easy<00:01:13.520> I

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
of it so this should be fairly easy I

of it so this should be fairly easy I
don't<00:01:14.570> want<00:01:14.690> to<00:01:14.750> waste<00:01:14.780> too<00:01:14.960> much<00:01:15.020> time<00:01:15.110> on
