00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.470 

I'm<00:00:08.420> here<00:00:08.660> to<00:00:08.920> talk<00:00:09.920> about<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.429> pinkie<00:00:11.209> slip

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
I'm here to talk about the pinkie slip

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.890 
I'm here to talk about the pinkie slip
fly<00:00:11.719> this<00:00:12.049> is<00:00:12.670> something<00:00:13.670> I<00:00:13.879> started<00:00:14.539> using

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
fly this is something I started using

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.940 
fly this is something I started using
when<00:00:15.320> they<00:00:15.799> came<00:00:16.550> out<00:00:16.610> with<00:00:16.790> thingamabob<00:00:17.660> errs

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
when they came out with thingamabob errs

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.740 
when they came out with thingamabob errs
thingamabob<00:00:18.950> errs<00:00:19.130> is<00:00:19.849> a<00:00:19.910> strike<00:00:20.300> indicator

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
thingamabob errs is a strike indicator

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.710 
thingamabob errs is a strike indicator
that<00:00:20.960> came<00:00:21.169> out<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.070> they<00:00:22.340> it<00:00:23.090> strapped<00:00:23.480> there

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
that came out and they it strapped there

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.580 
that came out and they it strapped there
and<00:00:24.259> they<00:00:24.829> punched<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.899> copper<00:00:26.899> grommet<00:00:27.320> in<00:00:27.439> it

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
and they punched a copper grommet in it

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.069 
and they punched a copper grommet in it
and<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.640> what<00:00:29.029> made<00:00:29.239> this<00:00:29.390> unique<00:00:29.450> right<00:00:29.960> off

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
and what what made this unique right off

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.389 
and what what made this unique right off
the<00:00:30.200> bat<00:00:30.380> when<00:00:30.559> I<00:00:30.590> started<00:00:30.890> using<00:00:31.099> them<00:00:31.340> I

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
the bat when I started using them I

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.080 
the bat when I started using them I
noticed<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:33.559> line<00:00:33.800> slid<00:00:34.610> through<00:00:34.879> them

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
noticed that the line slid through them

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.979 
noticed that the line slid through them
so<00:00:35.570> easy

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
so easy

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.700 
so easy
and<00:00:36.309> typically<00:00:37.309> with<00:00:38.300> slip<00:00:38.629> floats<00:00:38.899> which<00:00:39.320> I

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
and typically with slip floats which I

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.470 
and typically with slip floats which I
use<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.160> lot<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.609> they<00:00:40.670> work<00:00:40.850> really<00:00:41.120> good<00:00:41.269> for

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
use a lot and they work really good for

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.200 
use a lot and they work really good for
fish<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:41.780> deep<00:00:41.899> water<00:00:42.820> wouldn't<00:00:43.820> work<00:00:43.969> well

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
fish and deep water wouldn't work well

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.479 
fish and deep water wouldn't work well
in<00:00:44.420> my<00:00:44.570> current<00:00:44.899> because<00:00:45.859> you<00:00:45.980> need<00:00:46.129> too<00:00:46.339> much

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
in my current because you need too much

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.939 
in my current because you need too much
weight<00:00:46.730> to<00:00:46.909> hold<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.239> line<00:00:47.559> through<00:00:48.559> the<00:00:48.679> slip

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
weight to hold the line through the slip

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.209 
weight to hold the line through the slip
so<00:00:49.809> when<00:00:50.809> they<00:00:50.899> came<00:00:51.050> out<00:00:51.109> with<00:00:51.260> these<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:54.219> way

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
so when they came out with these the way

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.770 
so when they came out with these the way
they<00:00:55.370> float<00:00:55.579> in<00:00:55.609> the<00:00:55.760> water<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.239> line<00:00:56.449> just

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
they float in the water the line just

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.840 
they float in the water the line just
slides<00:00:57.350> through<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.739> copper<00:00:58.100> real<00:00:58.280> easy<00:00:58.519> so

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
slides through the copper real easy so

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450 
slides through the copper real easy so
it<00:00:59.239> doesn't<00:00:59.569> hang<00:00:59.719> up<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.379> when<00:01:01.219> you're<00:01:01.370> an

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
it doesn't hang up and when you're an

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520 
it doesn't hang up and when you're an
infant<00:01:01.819> you<00:01:01.969> don't<00:01:02.449> need<00:01:02.809> very<00:01:02.839> much<00:01:03.229> weight

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
infant you don't need very much weight

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.250 
infant you don't need very much weight
to<00:01:03.890> get<00:01:04.040> down<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.400> bottom<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:04.940> so<00:01:05.810> these<00:01:05.960> end

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
to get down the bottom and so these end

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.990 
to get down the bottom and so these end
up<00:01:06.380> working<00:01:06.560> perfect<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.250> can<00:01:07.430> use<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:07.820> a

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
up working perfect you can use just a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.790 
up working perfect you can use just a
little<00:01:08.240> bit<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.479> weight<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.350> would<00:01:09.470> slide

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
little bit of weight and it would slide

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.840 
little bit of weight and it would slide
through<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:11.870> trapped<00:01:12.170> air<00:01:12.579> is<00:01:13.579> more

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
through and the trapped air is more

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.800 
through and the trapped air is more
buoyant<00:01:14.450> than<00:01:14.750> foam<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.430> high<00:01:17.119> water<00:01:17.420> fast

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
buoyant than foam so in high water fast

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.800 
buoyant than foam so in high water fast
water<00:01:18.079> they<00:01:18.350> ride<00:01:18.560> high<00:01:18.799> they<00:01:19.040> don't<00:01:19.219> sag<00:01:19.810> they

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
water they ride high they don't sag they

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
water they ride high they don't sag they
don't<00:01:20.990> dip<00:01:21.680> when<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.920> hit<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.219> rock<00:01:22.430> they<00:01:22.729> stay

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
don't dip when you hit a rock they stay

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.209 
don't dip when you hit a rock they stay
on<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.600> top<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.049> surface<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.649> they<00:01:25.009> have

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
on the top of the surface and they have

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.999 
on the top of the surface and they have
a<00:01:25.250> bunch<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.610> different<00:01:25.939> sizes<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.770> works

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
a bunch of different sizes and it works

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.160 
a bunch of different sizes and it works
really<00:01:28.700> good<00:01:28.909> on<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.119> fly<00:01:29.360> rod<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.750> also<00:01:29.869> works

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
really good on a fly rod it also works

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.510 
really good on a fly rod it also works
good<00:01:30.649> on<00:01:30.680> it

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
good on it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.450 
good on it
on<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.700> spinning<00:01:32.330> rod<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:33.920> got<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.100> tie<00:01:34.340> on

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
on a spinning rod you just got a tie on

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.830 
on a spinning rod you just got a tie on
a<00:01:34.490> bobber<00:01:34.820> stop<00:01:35.210> if<00:01:35.420> you're<00:01:35.570> going<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.780> be

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
a bobber stop if you're going to be

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.810 
a bobber stop if you're going to be
using<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.110> spinning<00:01:36.440> rod<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:36.799> what<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.640> have

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
using the spinning rod but what you have

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.930 
using the spinning rod but what you have
to<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:39.619> have<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.830> have<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.130> continuous

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
to do is you have to have a continuous

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.700 
to do is you have to have a continuous
leader<00:01:41.240> with<00:01:42.140> no<00:01:42.380> knots<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.610> no<00:01:44.229> burrs<00:01:45.229> on<00:01:45.530> it

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
leader with no knots and no burrs on it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.540 
leader with no knots and no burrs on it
nothing<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.869> float<00:01:47.869> will<00:01:48.650> hang<00:01:48.830> on<00:01:48.979> in<00:01:49.490> a

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
nothing that float will hang on in a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.620 
nothing that float will hang on in a
slide<00:01:49.850> from<00:01:50.030> your<00:01:50.240> line<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.899> standard<00:01:51.770> imping

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
slide from your line so standard imping

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.850 
slide from your line so standard imping
two<00:01:53.630> times<00:01:53.869> your<00:01:54.050> depth<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.320> water<00:01:54.470> one<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
two times your depth of water one to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.889 
two times your depth of water one to
have<00:01:55.009> time<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.369> death<00:01:55.580> today<00:01:55.820> we've<00:01:56.509> got<00:01:56.630> four

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
have time to death today we've got four

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:57.999 
have time to death today we've got four
generators<00:01:57.380> going<00:01:57.560> we're<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.920> be

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
generators going we're going to be

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.160 
generators going we're going to be
fishing<00:01:58.190> nine<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.970> eleven<00:01:59.479> foot<00:01:59.630> water<00:01:59.869> so

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
fishing nine and eleven foot water so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.490 
fishing nine and eleven foot water so
we're<00:02:00.320> going<00:02:00.440> on<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.800> team<00:02:01.040> leader<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.259> what

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
we're going on a team leader and so what

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.190 
we're going on a team leader and so what
I<00:02:03.530> do<00:02:03.649> is<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.250> either<00:02:04.399> use<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.700> braid<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
I do is I either use a braid and the

I do is I either use a braid and the
braid<00:02:06.410> does<00:02:06.619> give<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:07.070> bit<00:02:07.220> resistance

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
braid does give a little bit resistance

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.850 
braid does give a little bit resistance
or<00:02:08.030> like<00:02:08.239> today<00:02:08.539> I've<00:02:08.720> done<00:02:08.899> enough<00:02:09.289> eight

it's<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.110> slip<00:03:12.410> fly<00:03:12.730> we<00:03:13.730> can<00:03:13.760> reel<00:03:14.150> all

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
it's on it on a slip fly we can reel all

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.260 
it's on it on a slip fly we can reel all
the<00:03:14.840> leader<00:03:15.020> up<00:03:15.470> into<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.890> pole<00:03:16.100> so<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:17.090> want

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
the leader up into the pole so you want

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.240 
the leader up into the pole so you want
to<00:03:17.360> get<00:03:17.510> your<00:03:17.720> starts<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.650> peel<00:03:18.830> and<00:03:18.980> out<00:03:19.070> your

to get your starts to peel and out your

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.460 
to get your starts to peel and out your
leader<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.640> just<00:03:20.480> use<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> surface<00:03:21.080> tension

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.320 
leader and just use the surface tension
to<00:03:21.830> help<00:03:22.280> forth<00:03:22.490> your<00:03:22.640> line<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.120> gets<00:03:23.240> a

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
to help forth your line out it gets a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.640 
to help forth your line out it gets a
little<00:03:23.450> sticky<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.110> get<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.350> your<00:03:24.440> fly

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
little sticky when you get to your fly

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:46.330 
little sticky when you get to your fly
line<00:03:43.960> indicator<00:03:44.960> and<00:03:45.680> that's<00:03:45.950> what's<00:03:46.220> gonna

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
line indicator and that's what's gonna

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.140 
line indicator and that's what's gonna
show<00:03:46.640> your<00:03:46.820> bike<00:03:47.950> down<00:03:48.950> there<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:49.880> want<00:03:50.090> to

don't<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:24.940> keep<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.270> close<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.750> boat

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:05:21.920 

it's<00:04:29.410> easier<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.950> manage

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.159 

that<00:05:22.350> UV<00:05:22.650> nonsense<00:05:23.660> worked<00:05:24.660> real<00:05:24.810> good<00:05:25.020> at

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
that UV nonsense worked real good at

00:05:25.169 --> 00:06:42.610 
that UV nonsense worked real good at
stage<00:05:25.440> roles

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.250 

that's<00:06:43.620> he's<00:06:43.890> taken<00:06:44.220> off<00:06:44.310> runnin<00:06:44.640> again<00:06:44.940> now

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
that's he's taken off runnin again now

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.870 
that's he's taken off runnin again now
that's<00:06:46.260> why<00:06:46.440> I<00:06:46.470> put<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.710> UV<00:06:47.220> not<00:06:47.400> cents<00:06:47.760> on

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
that's why I put that UV not cents on

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.909 
that's why I put that UV not cents on
there<00:06:48.030> so<00:06:48.150> it<00:06:48.210> doesn't<00:06:48.390> hang<00:06:48.720> up<00:06:48.960> when<00:06:49.650> you<00:06:49.770> get

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
there so it doesn't hang up when you get

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.730 
there so it doesn't hang up when you get
a<00:06:49.979> bigger<00:06:50.220> fish<00:06:50.580> and<00:06:50.610> he<00:06:50.850> takes<00:06:51.090> off<00:06:51.270> running

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
a bigger fish and he takes off running
