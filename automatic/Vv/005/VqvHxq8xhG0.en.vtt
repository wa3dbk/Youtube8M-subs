00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.810 
going to dip the end into the light blue
and<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.990> start<00:01:49.200> dodging<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.830> randomly<00:01:50.310> any

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and just start dodging them randomly any

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:06.350 
and just start dodging them randomly any
way<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.150> choose

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:23.190 

and<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.620> go

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400 

so<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.040> first<00:02:24.250> tool<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.640> use<00:02:24.670> was<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.750> dotting

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
so the first tool I use was a dotting

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.410 
so the first tool I use was a dotting
tool<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.000> flip<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.360> to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
tool as you can see and you flip it to

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
tool as you can see and you flip it to
the<00:02:28.540> other<00:02:28.629> side<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.790> has<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:31.890> rounded<00:02:32.890> out

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the other side it's has a rounded out

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.580 
the other side it's has a rounded out
tip<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.030> does<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.390> side<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:35.530> is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
tip and so does this side and so this is

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.990 
tip and so does this side and so this is
what<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.010> use<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.310> make<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:38.050> know<00:02:38.200> dots<00:02:38.560> or

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.339 
what we use to make you know dots or

are<00:02:48.819> actually<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.269> pointing<00:02:49.660> on<00:02:49.750> both<00:02:49.959> sides

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
are actually just pointing on both sides

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.830 
are actually just pointing on both sides
but<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.610> make<00:02:51.760> sure<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.209> one<00:02:52.690> of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
them is you know rounded out right here

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.589 
them is you know rounded out right here
and<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.370> actually<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:57.760> these<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> regular

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
and you can actually get these a regular

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
really easy to attain um there's like a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.949 
really easy to attain um there's like a
hundred<00:03:07.690> pack<00:03:08.110> for<00:03:08.440> what<00:03:08.739> two<00:03:09.160> dollars<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.630> it

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
hundred pack for what two dollars so it

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.780 
hundred pack for what two dollars so it
lasts<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.590> while<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.069> then<00:03:12.160> all<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.459> gotta<00:03:12.640> do

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
lasts a while and then all you gotta do

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.370 
lasts a while and then all you gotta do
is<00:03:12.819> after<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.299> use<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.540> don't<00:03:13.840> use<00:03:14.079> cotton

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
is after you use it don't use cotton

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.900 
is after you use it don't use cotton
because<00:03:14.920> it'll<00:03:15.569> attach<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.019> um<00:03:17.910> the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
because it'll attach to this um the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.120 
because it'll attach to this um the
cotton<00:03:19.239> fibers<00:03:19.599> will<00:03:19.780> even<00:03:20.440> with<00:03:20.620> acetone

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
cotton fibers will even with acetone

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.680 
cotton fibers will even with acetone
will<00:03:21.340> get<00:03:21.459> stuck<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.849> it<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.150> should<00:03:22.480> use

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
will get stuck to it so you should use

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.130 
will get stuck to it so you should use
on<00:03:22.930> like<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.620> Kleenex<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.610> paper<00:03:25.299> towel<00:03:25.630> put

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
on like a Kleenex or paper towel put

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.780 
on like a Kleenex or paper towel put
some<00:03:26.349> acetone<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.250> paper<00:03:27.430> towel<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.639> then

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
some acetone on the paper towel and then

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.849 
some acetone on the paper towel and then
wipe<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.209> clean<00:03:28.269> or<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:29.380> can<00:03:29.500> just<00:03:29.620> use<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
wipe it clean or you can just use a

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.590 
wipe it clean or you can just use a
piece<00:03:30.130> of<00:03:30.160> paper<00:03:30.370> right<00:03:30.730> after<00:03:31.030> done<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.510> just

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
piece of paper right after done and just

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.379 
piece of paper right after done and just
scratch<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.900> on<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.760> think<00:03:34.030> now

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
scratch it on there and so I think now

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.420 
scratch it on there and so I think now
the<00:03:34.450> Polish<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.079> a<00:03:35.109> little<00:03:35.319> bit<00:03:35.440> dry<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.220> then

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
the Polish is a little bit dry and then

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.690 
the Polish is a little bit dry and then
now<00:03:36.639> we're<00:03:36.790> going<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.970> start<00:03:37.180> daughter<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.690> go

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
now we're going to start daughter you go

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.640 
now we're going to start daughter you go
so<00:03:39.700> now<00:03:39.910> i'm<00:03:40.150> using<00:03:40.180> toothpick<00:03:40.989> instead<00:03:41.560> of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
so now i'm using toothpick instead of

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.559 
so now i'm using toothpick instead of
dipping<00:03:41.829> tool<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.670> if<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.180> know<00:03:43.299> if<00:03:43.420> they're

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
dipping tool and if you know if they're

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.240 
dipping tool and if you know if they're
almost<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:43.989> very<00:03:44.319> similar<00:03:44.709> sizes<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.950> you

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
almost like very similar sizes so if you

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.069 
almost like very similar sizes so if you
can't<00:03:48.579> find<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:48.910> dotting<00:03:49.269> tool<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.780> can<00:03:49.870> just

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
can't find a dotting tool you can just

00:03:50.079 --> 00:04:05.020 
can't find a dotting tool you can just
use<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.290> toothpick

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.110 

see<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.840> dots<00:04:06.620> are<00:04:06.950> very<00:04:07.280> similar<00:04:07.700> size<00:04:08.090> to

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
see the dots are very similar size to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.680 
see the dots are very similar size to
the<00:04:08.360> other<00:04:08.569> ones<00:04:10.000> they<00:04:11.000> just<00:04:11.300> do<00:04:11.420> with<00:04:11.630> a

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
the other ones they just do with a
