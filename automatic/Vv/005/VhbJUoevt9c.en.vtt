00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.620 
i'm using the benefit Porefessional
which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.640> good<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.390> oily

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
which is really good if you have oily

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
which is really good if you have oily
skin<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.259> large<00:01:46.770> pores<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.680> then<00:01:49.680> i<00:01:49.950> went<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
skin or large pores and then i went in

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.880 
skin or large pores and then i went in
with<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> revlon<00:01:51.360> colorstay<00:01:51.750> 24<00:01:52.259> hour<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
with the revlon colorstay 24 hour in the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
with the revlon colorstay 24 hour in the
shade<00:01:53.100> off<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.840> two

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
shade off and they have kind of two

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.749 
shade off and they have kind of two
formulations<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> normal

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
formulations I think this is the normal

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
formulations I think this is the normal
to<00:01:57.000> dry<00:01:57.030> skin<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> might<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to dry skin but it might be the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
to dry skin but it might be the
combination<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> oily<00:01:59.610> skin<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.229> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
combination to oily skin and then I just

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
combination to oily skin and then I just
basically<00:02:01.649> dot<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.130> around<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.520> face<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
basically dot that around my face and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.940 
basically dot that around my face and
then<00:02:03.180> went<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> flat<00:02:04.740> top

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
