anything most people do on their hip
right<00:00:17.070> there<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.050> put<00:00:19.230> something

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
right there and you just put something

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
right there and you just put something
on<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:20.130> TM<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.240> summer<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.869> coming<00:00:22.050> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
right around the corner so I thought I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.980 
right around the corner so I thought I
