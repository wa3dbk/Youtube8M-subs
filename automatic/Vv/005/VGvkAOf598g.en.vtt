two pieces of the new supersoft

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.819 
two pieces of the new supersoft
enterprise<00:00:45.270> corn<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> top<00:00:46.800> one

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
enterprise corn here now the top one

enterprise corn here now the top one
it's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> buoyant<00:00:47.670> piece<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.840> bottom<00:00:49.140> one

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it's a buoyant piece and the bottom one

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's a buoyant piece and the bottom one
is<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> sinking<00:00:49.950> piece<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.489> you'll<00:00:50.640> find

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
is a sinking piece and what you'll find
is<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.719> rests<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> lake<00:00:52.469> bed<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
is when it's rests on the lake bed it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
is when it's rests on the lake bed it
will<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> sit<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.390> slowly<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> then

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
will just sit really slowly and then

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.869 
will just sit really slowly and then
when<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> reaches<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> bottom<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
when it reaches the bottom it will just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.790 
when it reaches the bottom it will just
sit<00:00:57.120> up<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> nicely<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.260> balanced

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
sit up like that nicely and balanced

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740 
sit up like that nicely and balanced
now<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.430> normally<00:00:59.820> fish<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> small

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
now I'm normally fish this with a small

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.110 
now I'm normally fish this with a small
piece<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.170> bag<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> pellets<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.879> stick

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
piece a bag of pellets or it will stick

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
piece a bag of pellets or it will stick
a<00:01:03.149> groundbait<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:05.129> has<00:01:05.369> two<00:01:05.640> main

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
a groundbait and that has two main

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.789 
a groundbait and that has two main
effects<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> firstly<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.590> help

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
effects in that firstly it will help

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
effects in that firstly it will help
prevent<00:01:07.979> any<00:01:08.220> tangles<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.180> fish

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
prevent any tangles so you know you fish

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
prevent any tangles so you know you fish
in<00:01:09.630> perfectly<00:01:10.170> every<00:01:10.439> cast<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.369> then

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
in perfectly every cast and then

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
in perfectly every cast and then
secondly<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.290> gives<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.860> pile

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
secondly it just gives that little pile

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
secondly it just gives that little pile
of<00:01:14.220> food<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> fish<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> home<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
of food for the fish to home in on and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
of food for the fish to home in on and
then<00:01:16.619> they'll<00:01:16.830> suck<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.430> critically

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
then they'll suck up this critically

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
then they'll suck up this critically
balanced<00:01:18.240> two<00:01:18.479> pieces<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> corn<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> you'll

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
balanced two pieces of corn and you'll

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
balanced two pieces of corn and you'll
get<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.220> bite<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:21.540> there's<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.259> little
