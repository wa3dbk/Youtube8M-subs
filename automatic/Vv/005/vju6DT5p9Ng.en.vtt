00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.259
 many aspects was incredible I step 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.480
 by Monterrey was great everything as 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.539
 it happened despite the time and distance 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.090
 the former goalkeeper Ricardo Martínez does not forget 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.330
 and I keep a very feeling 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.180
 said the by monterrey and striped 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.490
 for me for me it is still the best 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.890
 football hobby people gave me 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.170
 how little I had to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.180
 he supported that he gave himself completely 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.039
 to the players, nothing more 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.470
 with me the also called fleeting 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 martínez talk to sound fenced how 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.960
 was that the regiomontano club is integrated 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.829
 Brush to the bottom surcharge 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.879
 I played in love 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.079
 and it is this which I Eduardo Solari 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.089
 invites 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.010
 Monterrey after playing some tournaments 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.320
 irregular without being able to transcend as 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.479
 I wanted ricardo martínez becomes 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.250
 later it begins important of the 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.190
 second title in the story scratched on 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.950
 the 2003 and so he remembers it was a title 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 very desired very expected 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.280
 the team years before was having 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.460
 many economic problems of the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.830
 team 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.550
 and suffered enough had problems of 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.650
 decline but 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.050
 with the passing of some seasons it 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.560
 manages to make a large group and passarella 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.820
 manages to consolidate that goal that where 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.960
 is achieved in a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.630
 as a necessary 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.119
 just to give relief to the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.790
 relaxation to the team for all 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.340
 problems that I was living 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 the grated exporter is how he saw and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.140
 he felt the northern classics 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.840
 and improve control by 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 ricardo martín punto cover also in the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.650
 classic america-chivas and this and I feel 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.200
 that by third the distance with a 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.050
 hobby in a city another other court 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.260
 in Mexico you lose something you lose 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.520
 intensity in contrast to the 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.000
 north there lives everything in it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.700
 scene is more intense either from the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.520
 tigers hobby or that of striped and that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.050
 makes for me to increase that 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.700
 emotion 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 and there was one that was left for the anecdote 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.620
 but it was not inside the court but 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.650
 out of it on an occasion that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.780
 we won the tigers team this comeback 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.690
 home and Monterrey that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.650
 find all full of beaten egg that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.680
 someone came up with 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.890
 to decorate it that day with a box of 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.260
 what was left over then even those 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.329
 things these details were very 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.950
 free for me his militancy the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.689
 monterrey was for the born the capital 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.519
 of the country so important in his career 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.040
 that radiates a great affection for the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.900
 shirt and the city and after me 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.230
 step of hatching most of the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.720
 people with whom I talk to them 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.290
 they identify a lot with that club and they think 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 that I am this native of Monterrey my 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.609

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.549
 so small at present the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.439

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.480
