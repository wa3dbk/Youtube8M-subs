00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi nice that you look again at a 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.140
 new video today i'll show you how 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.189
 you these nice tealight holders from 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.290
 can make paper 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.670
 I have already made a video with 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.280
 tealight holders that you can too 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.660
 looking back but these are all 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.660
 holders made of paper 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 then immediately start with the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.189
 first thing you need is paper and 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 is a glass in the form of a cylinder 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.719
 easy 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 here i just measure how big a piece i am 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.420
 must cut off 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.920
 stick it on and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 does with a pencil and inside 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.039
 convert between you wrote 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.039
 and then I can cut it off 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.010
 I pass on it all fits well 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.680
 and so flipping 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.040
 yes so see perfectly and what I am going to do now 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.260
 is so joke 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.570
 draw a kind of half on the paper 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.570
 rowers and dubai the whole paper 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.510
 wrist you are going to cut this out with a knife 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.909
 my set with knife and snow because you 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.369
 comes from action so that black 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.930
 reliable and that is exactly how you stand 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.930
 all scales back 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.090
 because is later on holes is fine 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.210
 important that you get the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.070
 pencil pencil dashes output because 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.050
 you see what else is going through 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.710
 when light shines 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.710
 so that I come from 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.320
 and then it's time to stick on here 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.450
 I just click on 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.440
 and then stick with my 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.060
 baby brother 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.850
 you do not necessarily have the glass 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.650
 so you can only stick paper 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.080
 stick if you are like that then 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.930
 you can pick up paper again and then you have 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.320
 you just glass without glue or anything 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.190
 and what i am doing now is i am going to ship it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.190
 unfold a little 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.740
 bad if you did that is you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 tea light holder ready 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.110
 super simple but it looks really whole 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.660
 very nice looking forward to next variant 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 I made this with blue paper and 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.990
 I kinda got the same way 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.240
 measured how big it had to be 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.980
 just because I need a little extra 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.090
 I got that glass through it 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.160
 printed 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.209
 a little piece and then it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.410
 measured 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.410
 just the right size 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.189
 just as much short so I left 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.189
 1 to 2 centimeters 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.230
 then fold the paper in half and some 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.480
 I do now is cut and I do well 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.760
 I make sure that exactly the edge where you are not 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.310
 it is cut that it remains the same width 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.950
 also of course the same amount of space 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.690
 in between the cuts 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.180
 and I do that with the whole paper 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 you have to pay attention to your radj or 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.659
 you do not go far by that is because you 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.870
 it still appropriate to each well 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.870
 to stick 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.190
 actually I am going to glue this must 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.609
 really stuck to the glass 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.609
 to become 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.410
 and that choice in book to paste first 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.410
 the bottom and then the top 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.200
 and that is also this body ready 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.780
 so that has become super nice effect as 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.790
 turning off the light is time to see how 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.829
 the next are going to make something here with him 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.030
 lower glass I can go with any 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.879
 make a sound 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.709
 and I draw the paper again to 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.079
 watch the formative do this is needed 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.480
 in what others has a somewhat different form 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.640
 so this one got a little round 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.840
 but that is fine that is not at all 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.970
 so difficult 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.180
 I fit well and measure and fit again 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.180
 and measuring 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.829
 and what I do is all parties there 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.829
 to draw 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.470
 and this I go again with a knife 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.470
 cut out 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.520
 according to my team it gives off 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.000
 mixed lines again and then sticks 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.000
 him down 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.230
 you can go to the strips a bit 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.360
 push outside so that the more light 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.360
 comes through and that is also ready 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.300
 time for the last variant with this one 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.729
 I have a paper with a print 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.370
 used up and these are snowflakes 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.470
 as you see and I have measured again 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.780
 how big paper was supposed to be i have this 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.440
 cut and then to pattern 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.389
 I looked at it and based on that 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.070
 let's say snowflakes 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.110
 I did not cut anything 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.490
 but I only have those lines 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.540
 traced 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.540
 and it and especially done 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.639
 he then I have these beers one 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.770
 bit so pushed out so that it 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.069
 light can pass through it, then you can fix it 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.069
 to stick 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.660
 and then your ready this really super 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.370
 became nice and all in all it was 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.980
 an error that I made and I wanted to leave 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.300
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.490
 I still found a very nice one 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.660
 addition to my previous video with 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.340
 tealight holders 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.440
 yes if you are one of these tealight holders 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.490
 but definitely send me a photo on twitter 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.010

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.450
 I think that was great you were this video 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.060
