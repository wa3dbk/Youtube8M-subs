00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the row through the hook wrap it up

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.150 
the row through the hook wrap it up
under<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.610> shank<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> hook<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.890> take

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
under the shank of the hook then take

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.840 
under the shank of the hook then take
your<00:02:33.340> loop

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.890 

and<00:02:37.970> secure<00:02:38.960> it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.730 

over<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> eggs<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:45.819> now

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
over the eggs so now

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.970 
over the eggs so now
we've<00:02:48.250> got<00:02:48.610> your<00:02:49.980> little<00:02:50.980> chunker<00:02:51.310> row

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
we've got your little chunker row

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.550 
we've got your little chunker row
secured<00:02:53.980> with<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.280> egg<00:02:54.400> loop<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.750> slid

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
secured with the egg loop and you slid

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
secured with the egg loop and you slid
it<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.010> hook<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.970> part<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.540> kind

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it up the hook so the part of this kind

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.820 
it up the hook so the part of this kind
is<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:01.480> been<00:03:01.810> punctured<00:03:02.230> with<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.470> hook<00:03:02.650> so

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
is it's been punctured with the hook so

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.930 
is it's been punctured with the hook so
that<00:03:02.980> will<00:03:03.070> help<00:03:03.160> hold<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.670> little<00:03:03.820> bit

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
that will help hold it a little bit

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.090 
that will help hold it a little bit
better<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.930> can<00:03:05.080> take<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.560> little

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
better then you can take a little

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.250 
better then you can take a little
puffball

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
puffball

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.390 
puffball
which<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.590> use<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:10.950> thread<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.160> up

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
which I like to use and thread that up

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.280 
which I like to use and thread that up
your<00:03:12.670> hook

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.720 

like<00:03:18.799> this

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.290 

this<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.769> probably<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.800> little<00:03:24.159> too<00:03:24.489> big<00:03:24.760> size

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
this is probably a little too big size

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.490 
this is probably a little too big size
puffball<00:03:26.129> but<00:03:27.129> it<00:03:27.340> would<00:03:27.489> work<00:03:28.379> we're<00:03:29.379> going

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
puffball but it would work we're going

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.190 
puffball but it would work we're going
to<00:03:29.560> slide<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:31.110> all<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.170> way<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.370> top<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
to slide it all the way to the top and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.390 
to slide it all the way to the top and
now<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:35.950> left<00:03:36.310> with

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.130
