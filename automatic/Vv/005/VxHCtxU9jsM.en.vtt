actually see it it's got a lot of slop
in<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> upper<00:00:36.750> hinge<00:00:41.629> and<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> set

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
in the upper hinge and so I have a set

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.150 
in the upper hinge and so I have a set
of<00:00:43.320> pins<00:00:43.590> left<00:00:44.840> from<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:45.989> other<00:00:46.140> hinges<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
of pins left from my other hinges and so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
of pins left from my other hinges and so
just<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.149> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> temporary<00:00:48.809> fix<00:00:49.079> on

just just kind of a temporary fix on
this<00:00:49.440> car<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:50.039> gonna<00:00:50.219> pull<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> door<00:00:51.090> off<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
rebuild the both upper hinges and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.709 
rebuild the both upper hinges and
hopefully<00:00:53.789> take<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> slop<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> these

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
hopefully take the slop out of these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.459 
hopefully take the slop out of these
doors<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.149> shut<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> little

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
doors and make them shut just a little

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.200 
doors and make them shut just a little
better<00:00:58.590> right<00:00:59.000> now<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.149> got<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
better right now you got it had a

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.250 
better right now you got it had a
slamming<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> body<00:01:03.660> line<00:01:03.870> doesn't<00:01:04.140> want

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
slamming in the body line doesn't want

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
slamming in the body line doesn't want
to<00:01:04.350> line<00:01:04.500> up<00:01:04.680> quite<00:01:04.920> right<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to line up quite right but if you can

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.620 
to line up quite right but if you can
kind<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:07.700> that's<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.060> slop<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
kind of see here that's how much slop is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
kind of see here that's how much slop is
in<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:13.159> work<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
in it so now I will work on this and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.830 
in it so now I will work on this and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
of things number one what a poor quality

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.219 
of things number one what a poor quality
paint<00:01:26.970> job<00:01:27.150> aid<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.689> painted<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.020> car

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
paint job aid when I painted this car

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.289 
paint job aid when I painted this car
white<00:01:28.500> car<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:29.369> white<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.880> bought<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
white car was white when we bought it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.899 
white car was white when we bought it
and<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:32.340> looks<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:33.000> done<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:34.909> crappy

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and it looks like it was done it crappy

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
and it looks like it was done it crappy
paint<00:01:36.060> jobs<00:01:36.329> are<00:01:36.570> us<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.600> anyhow<00:01:39.740> also<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
paint jobs are us but anyhow also this

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.830 
paint jobs are us but anyhow also this
top<00:01:41.100> hinge<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.759> see<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
top hinge you can see there is just the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.090 
top hinge you can see there is just the
bushings<00:01:43.229> are<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> shot<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:49.100> even

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
bushings are just shot and so even

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.990 
bushings are just shot and so even
though<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> proper<00:01:50.579> weight<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> dish

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
though the proper weight of the dish

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609 
though the proper weight of the dish
will<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> way<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> rebuild<00:01:51.720> both<00:01:52.020> hinges<00:01:52.259> I

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
will be the way to rebuild both hinges I

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
will be the way to rebuild both hinges I
actually<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.729> enough<00:01:53.939> pins<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually have just enough pins for the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.530 
actually have just enough pins for the
top<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.899> bottom<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.439> does<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.799> some<00:01:56.040> small

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
top the bottom one does have some small

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
top the bottom one does have some small
but<00:01:57.540> nothing<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> top<00:01:58.729> that's<00:01:59.729> so<00:01:59.850> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
but nothing like the top that's so I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.810 
but nothing like the top that's so I
think<00:02:00.119> that'll<00:02:00.390> make<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:01.430> huge<00:02:02.430> difference

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
think that'll make a a huge difference

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
think that'll make a a huge difference
in<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.000> car<00:02:03.210> until<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.659> thing<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.140> tore

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
in the car until this thing can be tore

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679 
in the car until this thing can be tore
down<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> done<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.490> anyhow<00:02:06.390> that's

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
down and done right but anyhow that's

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.089 
down and done right but anyhow that's
where<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.469> gonna<00:02:07.560> pull<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.860> hinge

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
where I'm at I'm gonna pull this hinge

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.200 
where I'm at I'm gonna pull this hinge
off

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
off

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.900 
off
and<00:02:09.920> remove<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.100> pin<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:11.760> some

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and remove this pin just put some

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
and remove this pin just put some
bushings<00:02:12.210> in<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> new<00:02:12.630> pin<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> pull<00:02:13.290> back

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
bushings in it a new pin and pull back
