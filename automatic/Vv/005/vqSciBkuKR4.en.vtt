00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 that's rather the future truck 2025 of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.120
 daimler 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.900
 This truck drives thanks to the so-called 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.980
 Highway pilots on highways up to 80 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 kilometers of autonomous aerodynamic 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 flowing forms and the most modern led 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.939
 technology that replaces the headlights 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.510
 bring life to the face of this 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.670
 Study the fascinating way 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.869
 Function efficiency and emotion 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 combined similar to the autopilot one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.630
 plane enable the heath pilot 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 thanks to radar sensors and camera technology that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.090
 autonomous driving independently of others 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 vehicles or control center this high 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 intelligent system relieves the driver 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.000
 from driving 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.079
 And he gains time for other tasks 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.239
 and communication with his environment 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.879
 the intelligent home pilot from daimler 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 responds to diverse 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.539
 traffic situation 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.530
 he can, for example 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.369
 rescue vehicles themselves the view 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.369
 dodge 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.409
 Nevertheless telegent technology remains 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.230
 driver always in the control of 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.450
 vehicle 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.210
 the hai the pilot does not replace the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.730
 driver but relieve and increased 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.100
 thereby the safety big advantages 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.350
 the lever offers security 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.440
 therefore , never be bored 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.340
 he is not distracted he is mine 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.650
 emotionally 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.900
 that means regarding safety 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 This system has significant advantages 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.310
 increased safety consumption reduction 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.220
 and a general cost reduction in the 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.340
 company revolutionizes the future truck 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.460
 20 25 the traffic 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.980
 the infrastructure the driver profession and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.260
 the forwarding industry 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.380
 Only the question remains when we use this truck 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.130
 We'll see you on the street 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.390
 have fixed plans 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.260
 this system as soon as possible in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 to bring series 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.830
 Of course, that depends on a variety of things 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.390
 first frame allaster 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.840
 very legal framework too 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.630
 call 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 at the moment it is not allowed in europe 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.220
 to operate autonomous systems that the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
 legislator must first here 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.380
 intermediate consumption go in the United States is the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910
 already possible in some states today 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.620
 and we have that myself there first 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.980
 to apply where will be first 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 allowed
