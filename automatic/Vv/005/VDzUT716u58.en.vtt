00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.929 
be back once it is closer to finishing
all<00:03:57.290> right<00:03:57.439> so<00:03:57.680> you'll<00:03:57.859> see<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.129> said<00:03:58.340> install

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
all right so you'll see it said install

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.240 
all right so you'll see it said install
from<00:03:59.060> sdcard<00:03:59.449> complete<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.439> it<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.769> now<00:04:00.919> looks

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
from sdcard complete and it is now looks

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.559 
from sdcard complete and it is now looks
like<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.519> rebooting<00:04:02.120> our<00:04:02.299> device

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
like it's rebooting our device

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.800 
like it's rebooting our device
automatically<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.489> now<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.819> should<00:04:05.509> boot<00:04:05.689> our

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
automatically so now I should boot our

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.929 
automatically so now I should boot our
device<00:04:06.049> back<00:04:06.290> up<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.769> should<00:04:06.829> it'll<00:04:07.729> will

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
device back up it should it'll will

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.849 
device back up it should it'll will
probably<00:04:08.599> take<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.870> little<00:04:09.049> bit<00:04:09.259> longer<00:04:09.470> than

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
probably take a little bit longer than

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.289 
probably take a little bit longer than
usual<00:04:10.009> to<00:04:10.220> boot<00:04:10.459> up<00:04:10.549> so<00:04:10.729> just<00:04:10.909> kind<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.120> keep

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
usual to boot up so just kind of keep

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.929 
usual to boot up so just kind of keep
that<00:04:11.509> in<00:04:11.599> mind<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.439> I<00:04:12.470> will<00:04:12.560> be<00:04:12.859> back<00:04:12.889> once<00:04:13.489> it

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
that in mind but I will be back once it

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.719 
that in mind but I will be back once it
does<00:04:14.120> boot<00:04:14.479> up<00:04:15.250> alright<00:04:16.250> so<00:04:16.400> my<00:04:16.489> phone<00:04:16.699> just
