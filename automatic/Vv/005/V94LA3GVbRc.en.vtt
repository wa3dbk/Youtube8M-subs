00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.200 
explore places I haven't gone in yet
especially<00:00:19.800> because<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.340> right<00:00:20.550> rule<00:00:20.789> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
especially because we all right rule so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
especially because we all right rule so
much<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:23.430> write<00:00:23.609> separately

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
much this so we can all write separately

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.589 
much this so we can all write separately
and<00:00:24.269> come<00:00:24.449> together<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.529> try<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.400> make<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
and come together and try and make it a

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.859 
and come together and try and make it a
balanced<00:00:28.260> kulsum<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.539> just<00:00:30.539> pushing

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
balanced kulsum so just pushing

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.849 
balanced kulsum so just pushing

weaker ideas tend to fall away and and
there's<00:00:59.550> always<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.210> moment<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.230> know

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
there's always a moment that we all know

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049 
there's always a moment that we all know
is<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> collective<00:01:02.160> moment<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:02.850> we've<00:01:03.030> got

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
is a collective moment we know we've got

something which is good and more and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
something which is good and more and
more<00:01:05.939> knowing<00:01:06.840> knowing<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.710> moment<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that's strong enough to use and then and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.649 
that's strong enough to use and then and
for<00:01:22.920> us<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.310> recording<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> having<00:01:24.630> that

live<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.210> it's<00:01:30.210> almost<00:01:30.840> sharing<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
live and it's almost sharing that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.469 
live and it's almost sharing that
feeling<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.800> an<00:01:31.920> orc<00:01:32.090> showing<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> feeling

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
feeling with an orc showing that feeling

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.040 
feeling with an orc showing that feeling
like<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.690> audience<00:01:35.360> yeah<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.540> or<00:01:36.690> completes

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
like an audience yeah it's or completes

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.230 
like an audience yeah it's or completes
the<00:01:37.170> circle<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.710> being<00:01:38.490> inspired<00:01:38.790> writing<00:01:39.149> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the circle of being inspired writing the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.580 
the circle of being inspired writing the
song<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.899> share<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> mean

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
song and then you get to share it I mean

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.420 
song and then you get to share it I mean
almost<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.040> kind<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> cliché

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
almost it's not so it's kind of a cliché

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.150 
almost it's not so it's kind of a cliché
but<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:45.840> zone<00:01:46.110> anymore<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
but it's not your zone anymore it's it

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.350 
but it's not your zone anymore it's it
seems<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.550> more<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:48.000> collective

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
seems to be more of a collective

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.990 
seems to be more of a collective
experience<00:01:49.640> it's<00:01:50.640> quite<00:01:50.789> exciting<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:53.000> look

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
experience it's quite exciting to look

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
experience it's quite exciting to look
forward<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> happening<00:01:55.170> again<00:01:55.229> with<00:01:55.560> an

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
forward to that happening again with an

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.990 
forward to that happening again with an
idea<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.009> we've<00:01:56.250> probably<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.850> even

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
idea that we've probably not have even

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660 
idea that we've probably not have even
had<00:01:57.240> yet<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> moon<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.890> yeah<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.550> quite

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
had yet the moon it's yeah it's quite

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.010 
had yet the moon it's yeah it's quite
insane<00:02:02.060> prospecting<00:02:03.060> about<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.479> music<00:02:06.020> how

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
insane prospecting about the music how

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.770 
insane prospecting about the music how
did<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> city<00:02:08.519> of<00:02:08.640> La<00:02:08.850> Hire<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.989> introduce

did the city of La Hire to introduce

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.120 
did the city of La Hire to introduce
London<00:02:12.780> probably<00:02:13.230> inspired<00:02:13.560> us<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:16.130> just

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
London probably inspired us to be just

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.610 
London probably inspired us to be just

a having any success back here would be

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.990 
a having any success back here would be
what<00:03:19.750> we<00:03:19.870> had<00:03:19.990> to<00:03:20.110> sacrifice<00:03:20.550> but<00:03:21.550> when<00:03:21.790> it

if<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.389> prepare<00:05:29.569> pro<00:05:29.990> show<00:05:30.229> as<00:05:30.380> much<00:05:30.500> as<00:05:30.650> you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
if you prepare pro show as much as you

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.629 
if you prepare pro show as much as you
can<00:05:31.599> but<00:05:32.599> that<00:05:32.780> extra<00:05:33.199> little<00:05:33.319> bit<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:34.610> is

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
can but that extra little bit that is

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.059 
can but that extra little bit that is
just<00:05:35.389> pure<00:05:35.599> if<00:05:35.690> it's<00:05:35.810> like<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.930> gentleman<00:05:36.380> you

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
just pure if it's like a gentleman you

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:38.620 
just pure if it's like a gentleman you
and<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.340> can<00:05:37.490> feel<00:05:37.729> it<00:05:37.940> kicking<00:05:38.270> into<00:05:38.539> your

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630

bloodstream<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.229> it's<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.590> think<00:05:40.069> that's<00:05:40.280> what

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
bloodstream and it's I think that's what

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.909 
bloodstream and it's I think that's what
becomes<00:05:40.849> quite<00:05:41.030> addictive<00:05:41.479> about<00:05:41.919> playing

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
becomes quite addictive about playing

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.070 
becomes quite addictive about playing
should<00:05:43.190> hang<00:05:43.550> shows<00:05:43.849> and<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.180> think<00:05:44.419> when<00:05:44.990> you

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
should hang shows and I think when you

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.790 
should hang shows and I think when you
do<00:05:45.319> that's<00:05:45.710> what<00:05:46.039> makes<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.340> difficult<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:48.560> it

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
do that's what makes a difficult in it

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.370 
do that's what makes a difficult in it
yeah<00:05:49.360> you<00:05:50.360> get<00:05:50.539> you<00:05:50.720> get<00:05:50.810> hooked<00:05:50.960> on<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.229> buzz

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380
