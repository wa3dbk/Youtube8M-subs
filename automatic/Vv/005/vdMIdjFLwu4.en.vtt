good not as hot as it is right now
no<00:00:15.599> all<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.230> let's<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.680> a/c<00:00:16.830> gauges<00:00:17.369> on

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
no all right let's get the a/c gauges on

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.429 
no all right let's get the a/c gauges on
it<00:00:17.730> let's<00:00:17.940> find<00:00:18.090> how<00:00:18.180> much<00:00:18.300> freons<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.050> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
it let's find how much freons in it and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.630 
it let's find how much freons in it and
let's<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.710> what's<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.160> all<00:00:20.520> right

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
let's see what's going on all right

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.170 
let's see what's going on all right
let's<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
let's do it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.890 
let's do it
on<00:00:22.020> any<00:00:22.470> a/c<00:00:22.769> system<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.150> find<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> service

on any a/c system to find the service
ports<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.580> follow<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.849> AC<00:00:27.029> lines<00:00:27.510> now<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
ports just follow your AC lines now you

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.439

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
can see back here we can see our low

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.160 
can see back here we can see our low
side<00:00:30.779> low<00:00:31.019> side<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> smaller<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.960> of<00:00:33.960> course

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
side low side is smaller and of course

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.530 
side low side is smaller and of course
the<00:00:34.260> line<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> bigger<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:36.030> had<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> follow

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the line is bigger and we had to follow

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990 
the line is bigger and we had to follow
the<00:00:36.719> lines<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.440> around<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> then

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the lines all the way around and then

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
the lines all the way around and then
under<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> air<00:00:39.510> filter<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.079> found<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.469> high

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
under the air filter we found our high
side<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.820> keep<00:00:42.030> following<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> lines<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
side if you keep following the lines you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.600 
side if you keep following the lines you
will<00:00:43.440> eventually<00:00:43.680> find<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.250> low<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> high

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
will eventually find the low and high

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
will eventually find the low and high
side<00:00:45.200> we're<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.559> hook<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.770> our

AC machine but this is going to be the
same<00:00:49.770> relevance<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:51.000> regular<00:00:51.210> AC<00:00:51.510> gauges

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660

you<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> machine<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.010> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
you don't have to have a machine to do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.399 
you don't have to have a machine to do
AC<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> course<00:01:02.219> nicer<00:01:03.110> blue<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> low

we're<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.890> look<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.100> our<00:01:14.220> static

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we're going to look at our static

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.960 
pressures static means not running now
you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.750> our<00:01:19.520> static<00:01:20.520> pressures

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you can see here our static pressures

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.899 
you can see here our static pressures
they're<00:01:21.960> both<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.830> same<00:01:23.070> low<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.670> high

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
they're both about the same low and high

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
they're both about the same low and high
we<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.960> almost<00:01:25.710> 100<00:01:26.009> low<00:01:26.759> side<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.860> here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
we have almost 100 low side and here

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.980 
we have almost 100 low side and here
over<00:01:29.100> 100<00:01:29.460> high<00:01:29.640> side<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> good

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
over 100 high side now that's a good

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.609 
over 100 high side now that's a good
sign

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
sign

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.850

that<00:01:32.220> tells<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.200> lot<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> things<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that tells you a lot of things about the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.030 
that tells you a lot of things about the
AC<00:01:34.979> system<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> static<00:01:36.060> pressure<00:01:36.320> if<00:01:37.320> one

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
have a restriction or the system could

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.830 
have a restriction or the system could

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
going to do now is go ahead and use our

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
going to do now is go ahead and use our
machine<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.280> recover<00:02:28.610> whatever<00:02:28.910> freon<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.660> in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
machine to recover whatever freon is in

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.390 
machine to recover whatever freon is in
the<00:02:29.989> system<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.560> we'll<00:02:30.709> know<00:02:30.830> how<00:02:30.860> much<00:02:31.129> freon

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the system so we'll know how much freon

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.850 
the system so we'll know how much freon
we<00:02:31.519> have<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.849> system<00:02:32.560> okay<00:02:33.560> we're<00:02:33.739> done

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
we have in the system okay we're done

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.000 
we have in the system okay we're done
recovering<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.489> freon<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:36.200> recovered<00:02:36.709> one

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
recovering the freon we recovered one

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
recovering the freon we recovered one
point<00:02:37.400> eight<00:02:37.670> four<00:02:37.970> pounds<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.079> system

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
point eight four pounds and the system

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.089 
point eight four pounds and the system
takes<00:02:39.680> about<00:02:39.860> 2.2<00:02:40.549> pounds<00:02:41.829> so<00:02:42.829> we<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.069> a

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
takes about 2.2 pounds so we are a

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.370 
takes about 2.2 pounds so we are a
little<00:02:43.250> low<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.690> if<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:44.959> don't<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.349> a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
little low now if you don't have a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.009 
little low now if you don't have a
machine<00:02:45.590> I'm<00:02:46.069> going<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.280> show<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.519> how<00:02:46.760> to

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
machine I'm going to show you how to

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.900 
machine I'm going to show you how to
check<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.319> freon<00:02:48.560> levels<00:02:49.129> once<00:02:49.730> again

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
check the freon levels once again

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.830 
check the freon levels once again
without<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.150> machine<00:02:50.329> we're<00:02:50.599> going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.780> go

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
without a machine we're going to go

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.050 
without a machine we're going to go
ahead<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.170> put<00:02:51.290> 2.2<00:02:51.950> pounds<00:02:52.160> in<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.700> system

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
ahead and put 2.2 pounds in the system

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.330 
ahead and put 2.2 pounds in the system
and<00:02:53.319> then<00:02:54.319> I'm<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.560> under<00:02:54.829> charge<00:02:55.099> it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
and then I'm going to under charge it

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.039 
and then I'm going to under charge it
and<00:02:55.459> then<00:02:55.700> overcharge<00:02:56.299> it<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.660> show<00:02:56.810> you<00:02:56.870> how

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
and then overcharge it to show you how

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.990 
and then overcharge it to show you how
to<00:02:57.140> read<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.319> gauges<00:02:57.769> let's<00:02:58.430> go<00:02:58.610> ahead<00:02:58.730> and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
to read the gauges let's go ahead and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.670 
to read the gauges let's go ahead and
hit<00:02:59.120> charge<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:02.720> wants<00:03:02.930> us<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.049> vacuum<00:03:03.319> but

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
hit charge it wants us to vacuum but

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:15.699 
hit charge it wants us to vacuum but
we're<00:03:03.769> not<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:05.620> charge<00:03:06.620> too<00:03:07.370> -<00:03:08.090> OH

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.830 

we're<00:03:16.220> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.489> crank<00:03:16.700> crank<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.390> car<00:03:17.599> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
we're going to crank crank the car and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.610 
we're going to crank crank the car and
turn<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.080> AC<00:03:18.170> system<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:21.290> can<00:03:21.409> see<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.030 

then<00:03:29.730> when<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> compressor<00:03:30.270> kicks<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:31.040> we

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
then when the compressor kicks on we

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.710 
then when the compressor kicks on we
should<00:03:32.250> see<00:03:32.400> our<00:03:32.520> high<00:03:32.670> pressure<00:03:32.970> rise<00:03:33.330> and

should see our high pressure rise and

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.890 
should see our high pressure rise and
then<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.900> low<00:03:34.080> pressure<00:03:34.380> drop<00:03:35.720> watch<00:03:36.720> our

be influenced by ambient temperature and

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.180 
be influenced by ambient temperature and
humidity<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.930> as<00:04:21.320> you're<00:04:21.500> driving<00:04:21.650> down<00:04:21.950> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
humidity and as you're driving down the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.379 
humidity and as you're driving down the
road<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.460> course<00:04:22.639> it's<00:04:22.790> really<00:04:22.910> hard<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.240> see

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
road of course it's really hard to see

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.610 
road of course it's really hard to see
it<00:04:23.450> with<00:04:23.570> gauges<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:23.960> driving<00:04:24.290> on<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.470> road

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
it with gauges on driving on the road

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.860 
it with gauges on driving on the road
but<00:04:24.770> if<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:24.950> work<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.970> gauges<00:04:26.300> with<00:04:26.419> also<00:04:26.720> the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
but if you work the gauges with also the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.540 
but if you work the gauges with also the
pressures<00:04:27.200> would<00:04:27.320> change<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.710> as<00:04:27.860> well<00:04:28.040> if

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
pressures would change that as well if

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.010 
pressures would change that as well if
this<00:04:28.790> were<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> normal<00:04:29.660> shop<00:04:29.840> environment

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
this were a normal shop environment

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.740 
this were a normal shop environment
ambient<00:04:30.770> temperature<00:04:31.280> would<00:04:31.400> be<00:04:31.520> 90<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.419> 100

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
ambient temperature would be 90 to 100

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.890 
ambient temperature would be 90 to 100
degrees<00:04:33.020> we<00:04:33.889> receive<00:04:34.250> more<00:04:34.580> around<00:04:34.850> 250<00:04:35.479> psi

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
degrees we receive more around 250 psi

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.629 
degrees we receive more around 250 psi
on<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> high<00:04:36.229> side<00:04:36.500> about<00:04:36.919> 40<00:04:37.340> on<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.490> low

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
on the high side about 40 on the low

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.700 
on the high side about 40 on the low
side<00:04:37.880> now<00:04:38.690> we're<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:38.990> go<00:04:39.080> ahead<00:04:39.229> and<00:04:39.500> add

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
side now we're going to go ahead and add

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.070 
side now we're going to go ahead and add
an<00:04:40.070> extra<00:04:40.760> half<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.180> pound<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.630> system<00:04:41.960> and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
an extra half a pound of the system and

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:57.040 
an extra half a pound of the system and
show<00:04:42.229> you<00:04:42.290> what<00:04:42.470> happens<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.889> pressures

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:06.800 

see<00:04:57.530> your<00:04:57.680> high<00:04:57.800> side<00:04:58.099> rising

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.629 

and<00:05:07.260> now<00:05:07.500> we're<00:05:07.710> getting<00:05:08.010> higher<00:05:08.220> than<00:05:08.490> where

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
and now we're getting higher than where

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.600 
and now we're getting higher than where
we<00:05:08.730> need<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:08.970> be<00:05:09.270> if<00:05:10.230> we<00:05:10.440> were<00:05:10.590> outside<00:05:10.800> once

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
we need to be if we were outside once

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.980 
we need to be if we were outside once
again<00:05:11.880> we<00:05:12.060> would<00:05:12.210> have<00:05:12.300> hit<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.570> 300<00:05:13.170> psi<00:05:13.620> mark

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.140 

this<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.710> not<00:05:19.860> bad<00:05:20.070> for<00:05:20.310> inside<00:05:20.670> but<00:05:20.850> like<00:05:20.970> once

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
this is not bad for inside but like once

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.550 
this is not bad for inside but like once
we<00:05:21.270> take<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.450> outside<00:05:21.690> this<00:05:22.170> is<00:05:22.260> going<00:05:22.440> to

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
we take it outside this is going to

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.750 
we take it outside this is going to
high-pressure<00:05:22.950> is<00:05:23.070> going<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.250> get<00:05:23.340> much<00:05:23.550> much

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
high-pressure is going to get much much

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.210 
high-pressure is going to get much much
higher<00:05:24.030> now<00:05:24.810> let's<00:05:25.110> remove<00:05:25.410> a<00:05:25.560> pound<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:26.070> it'll

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
higher now let's remove a pound so it'll

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.090 
higher now let's remove a pound so it'll
be<00:05:26.310> half<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.640> pound<00:05:26.850> undercharged

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.400 

now<00:05:32.640> we<00:05:32.700> can<00:05:33.000> see<00:05:33.150> our<00:05:33.180> low<00:05:33.450> side<00:05:33.750> down<00:05:33.990> here<00:05:34.260> or

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
now we can see our low side down here or

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.130 
now we can see our low side down here or
high<00:05:34.530> side<00:05:34.770> rather<00:05:34.950> down<00:05:35.250> at<00:05:35.340> 150<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.180> our<00:05:36.930> low

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
high side rather down at 150 and our low

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.030 
high side rather down at 150 and our low
side<00:05:37.440> we're<00:05:37.680> down<00:05:37.920> below<00:05:38.340> 30<00:05:39.560> you<00:05:40.560> can<00:05:40.590> see<00:05:40.860> now

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
side we're down below 30 you can see now

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.060 
side we're down below 30 you can see now
the<00:05:41.100> system<00:05:41.520> is<00:05:41.670> just<00:05:41.790> under<00:05:42.300> charged<00:05:42.920> so<00:05:43.920> once

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
the system is just under charged so once

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.500 
the system is just under charged so once
again<00:05:44.190> we're<00:05:44.880> explaining<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.330> how<00:05:45.360> you

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
again we're explaining to you how you

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.540 
again we're explaining to you how you
can<00:05:45.750> do<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.020> without<00:05:46.140> gauges

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.930 

now<00:05:51.060> we're<00:05:51.150> going<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.330> charge<00:05:51.509> back<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:53.250> 0.52

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
now we're going to charge back the 0.52

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.960 
now we're going to charge back the 0.52
we<00:05:54.090> took<00:05:54.270> out<00:05:55.490> you're<00:05:56.490> going<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.639> see<00:05:56.789> your

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
we took out you're going to see your

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:11.180 
we took out you're going to see your
high<00:05:57.539> side<00:05:57.900> come<00:05:58.139> back<00:05:58.169> up

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.680 

now<00:06:11.760> of<00:06:11.850> course<00:06:11.910> you'll<00:06:12.300> want<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.540> put<00:06:12.660> a

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
now of course you'll want to put a

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.290 
now of course you'll want to put a
thermostat<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:14.250> vent<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:14.760> always<00:06:15.030> use

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
thermostat in the vent and always use

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.350 
thermostat in the vent and always use
your<00:06:15.330> Center<00:06:16.200> vent<00:06:16.560> your<00:06:17.340> Center<00:06:17.730> vent<00:06:17.940> is<00:06:18.120> the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
your Center vent your Center vent is the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.660 
your Center vent your Center vent is the
closest<00:06:18.900> to<00:06:18.930> the<00:06:19.170> evaporator<00:06:19.710> and<00:06:19.920> always<00:06:20.460> put

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
closest to the evaporator and always put

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.790 
closest to the evaporator and always put
it<00:06:20.760> on<00:06:20.850> recycled<00:06:21.570> air<00:06:21.720> because<00:06:22.470> that's<00:06:22.650> going

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
it on recycled air because that's going

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.590 
it on recycled air because that's going
to<00:06:22.860> give<00:06:23.010> you<00:06:23.100> your<00:06:23.220> coolest<00:06:23.670> temperature<00:06:24.150> so

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
to give you your coolest temperature so

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.210 
to give you your coolest temperature so
Center<00:06:24.930> vent<00:06:25.140> recycle<00:06:25.680> there<00:06:25.860> that's<00:06:26.100> where

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
Center vent recycle there that's where

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.220 
Center vent recycle there that's where
you<00:06:26.280> put<00:06:26.400> your<00:06:26.550> thermostat<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.330> if<00:06:28.110> you're

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
you put your thermostat and if you're

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.320 
you put your thermostat and if you're
getting<00:06:28.470> below<00:06:28.830> 40<00:06:29.310> degrees<00:06:29.610> driving<00:06:30.180> down

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
getting below 40 degrees driving down

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.780 
getting below 40 degrees driving down
the<00:06:30.450> road<00:06:30.630> that<00:06:30.960> is<00:06:31.140> very<00:06:31.470> very<00:06:31.770> good<00:06:31.980> once

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
the road that is very very good once

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.100 
the road that is very very good once
again<00:06:33.030> you<00:06:33.150> need<00:06:33.240> to<00:06:33.300> be<00:06:33.420> driving<00:06:33.870> down<00:06:33.960> the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
again you need to be driving down the

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.780 
again you need to be driving down the
road<00:06:34.260> to<00:06:34.440> get<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.590> full<00:06:34.890> test<00:06:35.190> on<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.490> because

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
road to get a full test on it because

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.250 
road to get a full test on it because
that<00:06:36.000> is<00:06:36.210> when<00:06:36.330> you're<00:06:36.450> removing<00:06:36.780> the<00:06:37.020> most

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
that is when you're removing the most

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.040 
that is when you're removing the most
heat<00:06:37.560> from<00:06:38.370> the<00:06:38.550> condenser<00:06:38.850> and<00:06:39.780> when<00:06:39.960> you

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
heat from the condenser and when you

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.720 
heat from the condenser and when you
remove<00:06:40.320> the<00:06:40.440> heat<00:06:40.590> from<00:06:40.740> that<00:06:40.800> condenser<00:06:41.460> that

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
remove the heat from that condenser that

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.000 
remove the heat from that condenser that
makes<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:42.570> evaporator<00:06:43.080> that<00:06:43.110> much<00:06:43.410> cooler<00:06:43.650> it

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
makes the evaporator that much cooler it

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.580 
makes the evaporator that much cooler it
makes<00:06:44.190> the<00:06:44.340> AC<00:06:44.490> system<00:06:44.970> work<00:06:45.090> that<00:06:45.300> much<00:06:45.480> more

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
makes the AC system work that much more

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.140 
makes the AC system work that much more
more<00:06:46.590> properly<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.460> much<00:06:47.640> better

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
more properly that much better

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.430 
more properly that much better
so<00:06:49.140> that<00:06:49.350> gives<00:06:49.530> you<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.710> pretty<00:06:50.040> good<00:06:50.190> idea

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
so that gives you a pretty good idea

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.720 
so that gives you a pretty good idea
with<00:06:52.440> a<00:06:52.470> machine<00:06:52.860> or<00:06:53.070> even<00:06:53.130> if<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:53.430> don't<00:06:53.610> have

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
with a machine or even if you don't have

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.220 
with a machine or even if you don't have
a<00:06:53.820> machine<00:06:53.970> and<00:06:54.240> you're<00:06:54.330> just<00:06:54.480> using<00:06:54.660> cans<00:06:55.020> of

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
a machine and you're just using cans of

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.860 
a machine and you're just using cans of
freon<00:06:55.590> to<00:06:56.520> check<00:06:56.790> your<00:06:56.940> system<00:06:57.120> of<00:06:57.360> put<00:06:57.540> freon

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
freon to check your system of put freon

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.230 
freon to check your system of put freon
in<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.050> system<00:06:58.440> now<00:06:59.070> if<00:06:59.370> you<00:06:59.790> go<00:06:59.970> to<00:07:00.000> your

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
in the system now if you go to your

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.140 
in the system now if you go to your
parts<00:07:00.540> place<00:07:00.780> and<00:07:01.140> just<00:07:01.710> buy<00:07:01.920> a<00:07:02.250> can<00:07:02.700> of<00:07:02.730> freon

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
parts place and just buy a can of freon

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.450 
parts place and just buy a can of freon
that<00:07:03.420> just<00:07:03.570> reads<00:07:03.780> low<00:07:03.990> pressure<00:07:04.320> gauge<00:07:04.680> that

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
that just reads low pressure gauge that

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.630 
that just reads low pressure gauge that
is<00:07:05.520> wrong<00:07:05.970> you<00:07:06.630> need<00:07:06.870> to<00:07:07.170> see<00:07:07.410> both<00:07:07.860> sides<00:07:08.310> of

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
is wrong you need to see both sides of

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.390 
is wrong you need to see both sides of
the<00:07:08.730> AC<00:07:08.880> system<00:07:09.390> low<00:07:09.630> and<00:07:09.900> high<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.860> understand

how its operating and what's going on

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.200 
how its operating and what's going on
you<00:07:13.620> cannot<00:07:13.950> diagnose<00:07:14.460> the<00:07:14.640> system<00:07:15.030> or<00:07:15.180> even

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
you cannot diagnose the system or even

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.720 
you cannot diagnose the system or even
properly<00:07:15.840> feel<00:07:16.320> the<00:07:16.530> system<00:07:16.890> unless<00:07:17.130> you're

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:17.730 
properly feel the system unless you're

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.290 
properly feel the system unless you're

reading both low and high side now we

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.110 
reading both low and high side now we
know<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:21.600> system<00:07:21.810> is<00:07:21.990> properly<00:07:22.380> full<00:07:22.850> we<00:07:23.850> feel

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
know the system is properly full we feel

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.900 
know the system is properly full we feel
it<00:07:24.300> it's<00:07:24.600> nice<00:07:24.780> cold<00:07:25.170> air<00:07:25.430> now<00:07:26.430> the<00:07:26.490> customer

it it's nice cold air now the customer

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:38.710 
it it's nice cold air now the customer
can<00:07:27.030> be<00:07:27.120> happy<00:07:27.390> for<00:07:27.540> the<00:07:27.600> rest<00:07:27.780> of<00:07:27.870> summer
