million people on the Hallelujah diet

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700 
million people on the Hallelujah diet
that's<00:02:03.180> pretty<00:02:03.420> good<00:02:03.570> multiplication<00:02:04.409> isn't

it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.529 

so<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.519> have<00:02:09.610> two<00:02:09.819> million<00:02:10.179> today

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
so if we have two million today

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.770 
so if we have two million today
what<00:02:11.110> will<00:02:11.739> happen<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.129> next<00:02:12.370> 13<00:02:13.090> years<00:02:13.120> if
