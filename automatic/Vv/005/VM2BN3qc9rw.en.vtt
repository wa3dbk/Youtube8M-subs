00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.990
 not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.059
 hello I'm sandrine otsmane 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.100
 dog and behaviorist educator 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 dogs and cats today we are going 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.789
 see how to understand the language of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.130
 his cat and decrypt some 1d codes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.230
 code that can give your your cat 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.380
 to ask you to stop a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.300
 interaction with it is the fact of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 you lick your hand a cat that you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 lick your hand is a cat that you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.449
 actually ask to stop the action that 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.969
 is happening as per 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.879
 example caress him or keep him 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.829
 it's called hp and stroked biter 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.569
 contrary to what we 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 could think of a cat licking you 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:50.670
 is a cat who is just going to ask 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.179
 the stop of the action that is currently 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 happen 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.210
 a cat that stays on your lap and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.359
 who purrs and who does not seem 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.799
 want to go away is a cat who is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.110
 so in a well-being 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.000
 even if it will be necessary to pay attention the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.130
 purring is not always a sign of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 well-being it can happen that the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.950
 yield is also a sign of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.479
 malaise 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 so you have to interpret the language 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.509
 as a whole 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 look at the cat tail movements 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.570
 look at the position of his ears c 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.450
 ie 6 has had to be dilated or not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.420
 and if your cat wish to stop this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 moment of this interaction so it takes 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 let him go 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.179
 ch stroked biter is a cat 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 can come and settle himself on 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.079
 your knees 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.820
 you can start petting him and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.560
 the ch at any one time will start to 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.619
 you lick your hand to ask yourself 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.359
 to stop this action and 6.7 this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.399
 action is not efficient enough he 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.409
 will bite more and more hard until 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.689
 to be able to make the action of 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.100
 lick your name that's why so 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.499
 we are dirty the caressed ch 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.859
 bitter now you know more 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:03.630
 on the codes and signals of the cat 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.939
 so I invite you to find us 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.979
 in another video like for example 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.759
 avoid his cat making his claws 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.759
 on our furniture
