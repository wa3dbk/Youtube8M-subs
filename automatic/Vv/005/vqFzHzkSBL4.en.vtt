 Big mistake carbohydrates are 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.039
 essentials 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.340

 divide it and they will be 100 grams 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.399
 ideal amount for this delicious 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.049

 it must be boiling water and also 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.630
 Salt as salty as the Mediterranean Sea

 today I have the onion that 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.540
 it is translucent 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.540
 garlic cloves we put a few 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.239
 Chili flakes notice that the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 Italians also like a bit of 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.390
 spicy there does not know how rich it smells 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.270
 here is your tomato 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.209
 and seeds we are going to leave the seeds 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.340
 so that a wonderful sauce we are going to 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.610
 put two cups 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.480
 of tomato puree we are making a 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.160
 base sauce please 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.459
 write down the ingredients made in 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.890
 little house instead of you spending because 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.769
 He knows that Italian sauces are good 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.690
 expensive and apart they have conservatives and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.480
 usually its taste is like sweet 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.340
 so this has nothing to do with the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.170
 secret is spicing the very well here 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.930
 I have oregano 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.370
 let's put the broth of chicken broth 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.140
 of chicken that you did that also in 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.900
 the kitchen faces we will learn to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.019
 make rich chicken broth 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.310
 let's put here chopped parsley 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.260
 fresh and basil let's leave it 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.299
 Cook 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.359
 between about 15 minutes more 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.130
 time you leave cooking and more 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.259
 concentrated it's going to be but it's very 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.710
 important that the sauce when you the 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.740
 Try him taste tasty I do not mean 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.660
 salty but that you know concentrated 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.350
 because then it's going to mix and it's going to 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.210
 incorporate with our delicious pasta 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.300
 then the pasta is a very flavor 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.030
 neutral and we have to give him a salsita 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.190
 well well rich then we let it 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.190
 I'm going to try salt 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.730
 lacks a little eh lacks a 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.620
 little salt and appointment and know that when 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.840
 let it reduce you are concentrating 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.150
 the salt then important that in this 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.330
 point we leave this amount of salt and 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.740
 reduction as you go then if 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.380
 let's go well by checking what is the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.020
 delicious salt and good before 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.830
 finish the cooking is important 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.780
 tell him about the pasta look here 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.030
 we have a wonderful dish 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.160
 in three types of pasta here we have the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.240
 spaghetti I'm going to tell you the time 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.150
 cooking wrote down for seven minutes 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.070
 pasta is long that is spaghetti 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.950
 when it's spaghetti number 7 or the 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.790
 spaghetti medium 7 minutes when it is 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:42.840
 short pasta like this is the pen 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.150
 or the rifle about 13 minutes 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.290
 because the thickest pasta here the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.210
 We're seeing 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.039
 3 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.229
 here we have the short pasta and 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.040
 depending on the thickness will be the 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:58.490
 cooking time this code 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.500
 five minutes of cooking and this one is 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.520
 the most finite pasta that we use for 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.600
 a rich minestrone or a soup of pasta 3 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.880
 minutes to 4 minutes maximum now that 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.850
 do with the pasta when you cost it 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.640
 and arrive at that important moment of the 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.250
 minute is going to take it out of the pot and goes 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.230
 to go through the cold water jet that 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.560
 goes for cooking and since it stops the 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.320
 cooking we are going to put olive oil 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.960
 here I have a pasta look how good 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.020
