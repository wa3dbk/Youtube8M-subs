00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hallok people and welcome 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.650
 to a new video to the elder 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.810
 I would like to invite you to scrolls online today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.059
 show how to become a werewolf where to go 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 Werewolf can be and whether that is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.540
 whole well worth it and how to do the whole 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.639
 can also level up relatively quickly 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.269
 even other players also infected 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.180
 can 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 First of all, what is it worth? 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 or what are the pros and the disadvantages 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.099
 at the werewolf I have the whole thing for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.109
 example just taken because I'm in pvp 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 I want to get the most out of it 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.420
 one after the blades on the dates 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.000
 based that means I have here now 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.129
 at the werewolf neck small advantage 15 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.410
 percent more endurance regeneration in the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.739
 but I have that disadvantage as a disadvantage 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.500
 me in the box form percent more 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.020
 hurt by poison he suffered and in the pvp 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 it is so that there are many players 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.219
 with the bow and then for example 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.199
 poison shot poison injections rumlaufen 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.750
 and that's not very good, of course 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.420
 That's why I'm going to form the werewolfs 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.430
 this ultimate skill the warmer 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 I never used that transformation 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 whole only for the extra from the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.320
 regeneration that's why most people 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 imagine the stamina picture no matter for 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.369
 which class actually recommend in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.860
 the rule that there is a werewolf 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.630
 transformation is necessary and how 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310
 this whole quest is going on, I show 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.270
 you now 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.220
 In principle, there are two options 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 to turn into a werewolf 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.490
 do not go through one once 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 player character werewolf that means 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.170
 an opponent of sport and always only 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the areas so all around level 40 the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.189
 is then reapers market for the old 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.979
 MÃ©ridien helps in the heart packs and 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.869
 bangkirai for falling through alliance 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.310
 There are several places where such a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
 Werewolf can spawn 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.570
 and that would have to stop then if 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 Full moon means you have to be in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
 play also pay attention that is just 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.290
 full moon and as it is only 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.869
 appear 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.299
 from midnight from 12 o'clock one night goes 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.710
 always two hours that means as soon as then 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.780
 the night a report by one hour 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.909
 wait and then who can world for 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 spawn as you have to look for you have 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.689
 then only one hour to go around 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.310
 find and then you from the white to 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.570
 let kill 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 however, it is on the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.319
 consoles really really hard that gives 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.000
 very many players you just 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.290
 they have to play differently in that case 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.689
 the spawn werewolves to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.030
 after killing and generally at the extreme 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.500
 mass the current areas rumlaufen there 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.849
 it is really difficult then sometimes 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.950
 to get off 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.599
 and the probability that bigger 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.489
 because just such an idiot and comes 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.469
 then kill this werewolf and then have to 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.060
 you have to wait again you have to 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.590
 always wait until then full moon is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.890
 and that then draws extremely into the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 length 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.010
 I would recommend you then 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.290
 from another player 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.269
 but you should actually let go of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.189
 a werewolf opponent has been bitten 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 his quest will be yours 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.340
 to the capital if you the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.980
 have completed then you have the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.260
 choice to go to the priest to heal you 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.989
 to leave money for you then the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.069
 werewolf to get rid of you are alternative 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.870
 Of course you can then also 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.669
 werewolf screaming and then the quest 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.250
 start row if you are from the player 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.900
 bitten then it must also before 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.000
 The werewolf screaming happen there 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.889
 is a scroll like you have to 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.389
 then just click there the 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.180
 quest accept and then you will in 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.769
 left a solo report as soon as you 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.139
 You have to enter without leaving 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.329
 to talk to the nsc and to the altar 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.950
 There you will then new instructions 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.680
 we'll get one 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.780
 transform and then you have to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.579
 aim to eat with your pack 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.930
 currently you are almost the puppy 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.120
 and would first have to go to the right one 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.560
 Werewolf you have to you as 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.599
 to prove worthy by setting a goal 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.159
 finds and that kills the little opponents 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.680
 are not enough here so you have to 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.819
 Looking for a boss with a life bar 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.199
 he has it again so a few extra 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.150
 golden ornaments 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.530
 that could be eg poverty or as in 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.109
 my case as a giant snake 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.790
 But there are others 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.900
 I let me know that should be after 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 vary 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.699
 In any case, that's such an adversary 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.379
 then you have to catch the 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:54.720
 Action buttons for roar then becomes 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.250
 appear automatically and then 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.349
 new rudel members come you have to 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.970
 then eat with them and then 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.439
 you will go back to the altar 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.060
 asked for the whole thing there 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.680
 and then you are too 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.470
 already a werewolf and also gets the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.299
 new style bar appears and then too 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.020
 all the passive and active skills 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.730
 from the werewolf then to level 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.530
 now we come to it like others 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 players can bite for this you need 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.630
 the passive craft must be blood moon 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.459
 the werewolf skill ranked sixth 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.900
 and that's what you do 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.570
 actually very easy with 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.000
 small pug so low level pug and me 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.760
 did that in oregon the old 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.220
 dominion there are quite a few wolves 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.570
 and to find bears in the case of debris 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.920
 home there you have to scream away from 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.720
 matthiesen and then a bit 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.330
 continue to run north and in the forest 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.890
 are quite a lot of wolves and bears and 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.040
 with me they are still displayed in yellow 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.470
 because i like this city from the bad 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.020
 liberated and I want to get up 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.210
 any case with the player gamer player 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.830
 0 Thank you for giving me this spot 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.270
 shown and he also gave me the up 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.970
 sponsored so many many love 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.860
 thanks for that then also here 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.350
 could record video 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.820
 there you go simply about looking for you 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.460
 then a few wolves and a few berries 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.380
 and it does not even hit the skin at all 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.750
 any crafts around yours 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.810
 ultimate ability diverse events 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.490
 quickly and then transform 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.380
 looking for you again share opponents 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.910
 together and skin that and you see it 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.770
 comes to really quickly so 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.180
 after three four opponents I had then 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.730
 already the whole on level 2 and 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.470
 in total, the level six is ââabout 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.870
 took half an hour and then 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.970
 you can then just before the werewolf 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.310
 screaming in the cut lay in rift in 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.860
 bangkok then also bite other players 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.720
 with triangle and circle on the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.640
 Playstation 4 so with the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.160
 key combination for the synergy effect 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.170
 and then you can one weeks a 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.720
 players bite then a timer runs 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.400
 From there he has just bloody scenes 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.320
 is there and you just can not 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.390
 other players bite very interesting 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.680
 this description or this reason 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.360
 why we do not have another player then 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.970
 could bite just because blood is at the ten 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.919
 but good it should be so far 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.050
 I hope that could be you 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.630
 I hope there were some tips 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.340
 that brought you something when 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.930
 you liked the video but let it 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.820
 up there and if you have nothing left to do 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.130
 first time online then want to miss 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.700
 subscribed and switches to the next 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.700
 let's do it
