00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.270 
an AHA being enjoyed it because still
girls<00:02:14.580> study<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.510> work<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.590> not<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.250> a

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
girls study and work and it's not like a

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.400 
girls study and work and it's not like a
full-time<00:02:17.700> job<00:02:18.050> enjoyed<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> play

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
full-time job enjoyed it to play

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
full-time job enjoyed it to play
football<00:02:19.680> because<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.580> don't<00:02:20.760> get<00:02:20.940> paid<00:02:21.390> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
football because we don't get paid that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.200 
football because we don't get paid that
much<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.800> stop<00:02:23.070> working<00:02:23.460> or<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.000> stop

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
much as to stop working or to stop

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.240 
much as to stop working or to stop
studying<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.720> just<00:02:24.900> play<00:02:25.080> football<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.740> if

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
studying and just play football so if

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250 
studying and just play football so if
you<00:02:26.340> have<00:02:26.460> something<00:02:26.730> else<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.450> with

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
you have something else to do with

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.580 
you have something else to do with
practicing<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.630> we<00:02:30.630> don't<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.960> all<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> time

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590
