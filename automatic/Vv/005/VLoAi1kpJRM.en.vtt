you know and mixed colors I went not but
the<00:04:57.270> hair<00:04:57.570> is<00:04:58.790> really<00:04:59.790> really<00:05:00.390> really<00:05:00.810> soft

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
the hair is really really really soft

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.460 
the hair is really really really soft
and<00:05:01.440> all<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.430> all<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.790> paid<00:05:04.820> 9530<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:06.060> UM<00:05:07.100> and

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
and all in all I paid 9530 to UM and

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.900 
and all in all I paid 9530 to UM and
really<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.620> only<00:05:10.740> reason<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.340> was<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.670> much

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
really the only reason it was that much

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.260 
really the only reason it was that much
is<00:05:12.150> because<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:13.770> shipping<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:15.060> like

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
is because of shipping you know like

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.050 
is because of shipping you know like
twenty-six<00:05:15.750> dollars<00:05:15.900> so<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:17.520> bundle<00:05:17.910> is

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
twenty-six dollars so the bundle is

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.659 
twenty-six dollars so the bundle is
dealt<00:05:18.300> with<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.540> 69<00:05:19.080> but<00:05:19.350> because<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.160> shipping

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
dealt with in 69 but because I shipping

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.900 
dealt with in 69 but because I shipping
you<00:05:20.940> know<00:05:21.090> it<00:05:21.720> was<00:05:21.930> more<00:05:22.400> but<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:23.460> know<00:05:23.730> the
