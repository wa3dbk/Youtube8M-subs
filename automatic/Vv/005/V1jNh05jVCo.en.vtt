00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 little finger from here went thumb 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 root of the nose under the net or technique 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 total destruction depending on 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:25.850
 Destinations well now consider 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.850
 work on the phalange of the thumb 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 created a foothold at the onset of the articular 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.280
 thumb bags now begin 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.780
 impact is carried out according to the principle of a map 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 hypotenuse skips this one leg that's 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.420
 the leg and from the phalanx of the thumb from 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 nail up the hypotenuse will 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 impact pain effect and with rotation 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 and back or will be 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 work here grab he grabbed here 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:12.560
 from here it worked in itself 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:17.970
 with mandatory finishing or frying with 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 bringing on again the fulcrum shoulder 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.909
 we give to the spine at 45 degrees 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 or by their destruction or under 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:31.549
 root of the nose picking up his underwear on 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.549
 control over tracking 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.200
 such an option is possible here 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.060
 see the impact in the same way 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:50.150
 will be again on the phalanx of a large 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:53.610
 fingers a little under the village where they twisted themselves 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.100
 farther back hold 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.010
 slaughtered work on the phalanx of a large 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 finger rolls on the principle of the boat 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.440
 hypotenuse rolls cathetus and hypotenuse 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.770
 will be 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.870
 from the nail phalanx under 1 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.780
 that is, here it goes exposure here 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.940
 she goes now how she carried 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:30.960
 held here created a foothold 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:35.100
 and here I will fly with rotation works 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.130
 position of capture grabbed but back 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.890
 in the beginning they created a little coaxiality 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:50.390
 cranked myself again all the work 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:55.190
 starts at the beginning with alignment here 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.190
 here here 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.150
 i am an hour 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 and when you get up so well 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.350
 rack consider work on your finger with 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.480
 on the outside it is usually very 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.780
 honest position man embed 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.260
 click here he got into boxing 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.860
 rack or to any other rack unit 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.920
 karate 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.610
 so that immediately goes plug and 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.620
 superimposed on 4 fingers now how 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.090
 way the work is done again 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.010
 rolls the hypotenuse rolls 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:11.120
 create an angle of 90 degrees to 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.870
 forearm and kodak corner starts 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.430
 getting more than 90 degrees will go 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.680
 pain effect 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.510
 now begin the impact act of the second 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:28.090
 phalanges on her wrists 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.730
 elbow here is this leg here is this cafe on 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.700
 right triangle trailer here 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.490
 this is a leg here is a leg and this is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.220
 hypotenuse effect is carried out 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.720
 how do we start to pull out 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:48.760
 spirals with wednesdays down up and 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.410
 give now further what we start 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.090
 fulcrum and 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:02.950
 from this rotation has already gone work 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.950
 again from here or fingers moving 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.520
 further possible and here
