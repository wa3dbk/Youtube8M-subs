00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.250
 32-bit has this song and 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.359
 yes we can see 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.089
 nobody saw the meeting 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.629
 first May so play free 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.629
 Goodbye Good Friday last week 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.070
 but hundreds 2 as an encounter 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.439
 So let's start with Matthias 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.179
 I have PDS to play between Werder Bremen and VfL Wolfsburg 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.959
 I think that Wolfsburg lose word with a 0 2 2 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.660
 Bremen has won against Pauli and is currently in an upswing 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.910
 see is 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.310
 Osburg 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.310
 in Cologne now that had as two weeks but 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.430
 I can often say mine up to 15 percent 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.580
 the next opponent 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.460
 he is not a starter duel though 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 It is completely different so everyone can not say it this way anymore but it is 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.430
 currently not only the loud against Pauli 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.610
 yet the rising-duel is both first ascended in the last song 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 League where I believe that one of the two descends again 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.630
 and I believe in this EM HATIF will win Lautern with a two to zero 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.760
 Pauli never dapd 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.760
 in that had found in the first again 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
 if it will not take 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.060
 in this encounter is an end Saturday party 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.460
 I would take between 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 Borussia Dortmund and the first time in Nuremberg 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.329
 the best backround teams at least after the goalkeepers seen Bloomberg 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.329
 ten goals Dortmund 9 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
 but not now for both so 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 a draw 1 1 Super 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:16.289
 Dennis encounter is between HSV and SC Freiburg 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.689
 Europe have won only once against Hamburg in Hamburg 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.689
 That was the time the doctor had died 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.179
 that will change 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.179
 the OLG Bremen with 1 2 to 1 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.409
 the next match is between FSV Mainz 05 and Eintracht 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.239
 Frankfurt 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.439
 At the meeting we have never won away 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.699
 except one time in the dfb cup but never in a league 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.909
 and in the first league there was everything 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.959
 in Mainz if you decide without 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.939
 that will change now 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.059
 because that came along to think along 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:08.349
 it does not have to be my tip I type 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 striking second 2 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.259
 Dennis encounter is between TSG Hoffenheim and VfB Stuttgart TV 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.689
 Stuttgart is currently 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.449
 in a good mood again 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.449
 Question mark 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.839
 who now with only three rows 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.909
 but Stuttgart will win with 3 2 1 against Hoffenheim 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.890
 The next match is between the first FC Köln and Bayer Leverkusen 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.850
 when it won the Cologne at home against Leverkusen 19 clock Simon 90th 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.699
 in which we also written off so 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.529
 Yes 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.329
 D rather not 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.329
 Georgen Böhm 2 0 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.359
 in this encounter 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
 is between Hannover 96 and Borussia Mönchengladbach 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.889
 Gladbacher goal well defeated at home 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.150
 Hanover 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.860
 third 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 With a victory, they now consolidate third place 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.440
 and they will win Roth again with a 1 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.879
 and 9 the top match between Bayern Munich and FC Schalke 04 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 Henderson has won Schalke twice against Bayern 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.460
 if Milan had not been able 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.660
 delicious Ghent victory too who knows that already Waber I believe that Bayern 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.110
 lose again against Schalke 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.139
 and thus 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.590
 by a victory because II 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.169
 out of sight 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.169
 Plagge becomes if he with all and 2 to 1 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.240
 that was the tips 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.189
 a 32 game days 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.270
 the next matchdays are only on Saturday player Wales 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.360
 Anderson Song two games only on Saturdays every 15 30 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.970
 So the last game 38 at Bayern against Schalke 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.499
 the last extraordinary we want 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.229
 rarely does the mathematical but 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.150
 Tami night shift there is the word there at all 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.400
 we look gratefully to the next match day 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.169
 so stood
