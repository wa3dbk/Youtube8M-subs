00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.259
 good evening in pendrecht record of june that ran slightly libya minute 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.639
 and I can get you up tonight in you will be nothing at all when a whore in Cambuur 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.589
 their stadium or replaced 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.769
 to the types that series 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.939
 Is that you have this time because of your intuition and it is that everyone looked 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.999
 in addition to the lights, none of that effort goes wrong 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.259
 he didn't look at the screen 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.259
 that shortage from viewers 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.149
 the following times started at 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.890
 only me 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.790
 the patrick wouters 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.310
 otherwise make ghana 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.460
 and the batteries also exceeded the staff something new city 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 number and piet tension on the slopes 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 now I just know 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 and your best 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.040
 release the small fish 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.180
 but that was I think if you run a new clinge very quickly 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.390
 the contagious 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.420
 was in the neighborhood of characters 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820
 and I would have him too 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.880
 you are then you should see this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.170
 4 left text I know I have to tie it up instead of on it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 This means that the income from the research 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 then the navy could flee this is good 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 minimum piet yogurt 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 Willem II must succeed 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.110
 mix for example have a pietsie ever 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 therefore 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 also is 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 and it turned out that patrik berger was working 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 she got a happy job to admire his concerts 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.730
 press mobility club of will 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.830
 then go wonderful again 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.460
 that's how bundesliga news can be done 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.690
 also a tail 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 touring 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.360
 but then it carries the cashes again 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 make the statement 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.609
 ultimately too strong 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.359
 perth anp the pension agreement 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 he follows what may be going to collect it 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.019
 what a bit on that, however, is the word panties 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 not on anp 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:54.769
 hold the hand on one side 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.699
 I've also been before 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.699
 dramatic that you cracked on a sailor 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.339
 so to stand 9 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.289
 that was a disaster 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:20.199
 it was the card for chemistry the equipe isi that nothing can come 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.299
 to the ordinary
