00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.419
 hi those freestyle traps and 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.919
 the show that is reminiscent m6 on 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.530
 news topics 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.900
 there is streaming there are you tube or 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.160
 yet netflix as much new media 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.170
 which allow to have programs 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.940
 in the immediate future the opposite of this 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.190
 good old TV which suddenly seem 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.870
 to go out then is what we can 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.400
 to say that television was is in 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.870
 difficulty currently do not have 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.150
 really for now is not done 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.890
 really feel the duration of listening 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.079
 of television has rather increased 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.120
 last year it is 3 hours 47 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.970
 by hot we feel differences 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.910
 with young people, especially those aged 15 to 34 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.250
 who watch more videos on youtube 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.020
 and obviously tendentially it can 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.489
 change things and when we see the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.320
 audience scores that these young people make 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.880
 on the internet we understand that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.680
 tendentially the chains of 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.630
 television be a little worried to 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.190
 about their own existence and 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.809
 to exist is precisely what allows 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.100
 the canvas to many rappers we go 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.289
 immediately went to see to find out what 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.420
 that he freestyle TV goes into 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.520
 the internet mission because obese 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 of which 10 matt morandini there in the clit 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.329
 reality shows none of a comical 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.579

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:19.310
 media how did I know I started 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.259
 by preferring TV to school then 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.490
 are followed by school tendons then 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.749
 I understood that it could convey 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.219
 that bullshit 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.319
