00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
my biggest concerns about the film so uh

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.110 
my biggest concerns about the film so uh
this<00:01:47.620> is<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:48.100> is<00:01:48.160> high<00:01:48.400> up<00:01:48.430> on<00:01:48.670> Mike<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.970> see

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
this is a this is high up on Mike to see

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.930 
this is a this is high up on Mike to see
list<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:49.510> 2013<00:01:50.350> however<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> have<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.610> say<00:01:51.760> I'm

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
list in 2013 however I have to say I'm

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.420 
list in 2013 however I have to say I'm
very<00:01:52.210> nervous<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.870> it's<00:01:53.620> not<00:01:53.800> up<00:01:53.980> on<00:01:54.070> other

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
very nervous that it's not up on other

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.580 
very nervous that it's not up on other
people's<00:01:54.850> lists<00:01:55.120> so<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.360> feel<00:01:55.600> that<00:01:55.750> Disney<00:01:56.110> has

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
people's lists so I feel that Disney has

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.530 
people's lists so I feel that Disney has
made<00:01:56.800> some<00:01:57.010> bad<00:01:57.370> choices<00:01:57.400> not<00:01:58.090> only<00:01:58.390> in<00:01:58.510> terms

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
made some bad choices not only in terms

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.270 
made some bad choices not only in terms
of<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:58.990> way<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.230> film<00:01:59.410> is<00:01:59.530> being<00:01:59.650> shot<00:02:00.010> and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
of the way the film is being shot and

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.320 
of the way the film is being shot and
portrayed<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:00.850> also<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.150> way<00:02:01.210> their

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
portrayed but also the way their

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.420 
portrayed but also the way their
advertising<00:02:01.780> it<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.440> i<00:02:02.800> guess<00:02:03.160> i'll<00:02:03.280> start

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
advertising it so i guess i'll start

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.770 
advertising it so i guess i'll start
with<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.550> advertising<00:02:04.210> because<00:02:04.330> that's<00:02:04.630> what

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
with the advertising because that's what

movie<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.200> before<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.890> guess<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.670> some

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
movie like this before I guess to some

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.130 
movie like this before I guess to some
degree<00:02:18.940> he<00:02:19.090> was<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:19.300> mirror<00:02:19.510> mirror<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.990> he

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
degree he was in mirror mirror and he

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.020 
degree he was in mirror mirror and he
did<00:02:20.290> very<00:02:20.470> well<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.550> did<00:02:22.000> not

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
did very well in that but that did not

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.660 
did very well in that but that did not
do<00:02:22.420> well<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.230> would<00:02:23.740> be<00:02:23.770> really<00:02:24.130> reluctant

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
do well so I would be really reluctant

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.540 
do well so I would be really reluctant
to<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.870> bet<00:02:26.860> all<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.070> money<00:02:27.280> on

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to kind of like bet all my money on

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.310 
to kind of like bet all my money on

Armie Hammer you know to double down on
him<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:29.950> think<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.820> but<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.270> can

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.440 
understand he is the lone ranger and
it's<00:02:33.310> embarrassing<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.880> not<00:02:34.090> make<00:02:34.239> him<00:02:34.330> the

think you know just like the new poster

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.810 
think you know just like the new poster
they<00:02:38.440> debuted<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.100> should<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.550> mix

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
they debuted it should really be a mix

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.270 
they debuted it should really be a mix
of<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> two<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.300> them<00:02:40.390> together<00:02:40.540> ah<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:42.130> other

of the two of them together ah the other
thing<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.670> think<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:42.970> might<00:02:43.030> hurt<00:02:43.300> this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
thing that I think this might hurt this

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.050 
thing that I think this might hurt this
film<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.440> know<00:02:45.070> westerns<00:02:45.640> are<00:02:45.790> bleak

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.590 
Depp film uh you know good film but
again<00:03:17.680> you're<00:03:18.640> not<00:03:18.790> creating<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.269> world<00:03:19.420> that

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.199 
I think they should have gone more

don't<00:04:06.819> I<00:04:07.150> don't<00:04:07.209> even<00:04:07.360> know<00:04:07.540> how<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.659> discuss

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049

it<00:04:08.170> with<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.319> coming<00:04:08.590> across<00:04:08.769> poorly<00:04:09.280> myself

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
it with that coming across poorly myself

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.119 
it with that coming across poorly myself
I<00:04:10.060> guess<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:10.989> doesn't<00:04:11.110> have<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.500> dignity<00:04:11.709> that

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
I guess it doesn't have the dignity that

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.530

spots<00:04:13.900> for<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.140> film<00:04:14.379> maybe<00:04:14.590> that's<00:04:14.799> just<00:04:14.890> a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
spots for the film maybe that's just a

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.250
