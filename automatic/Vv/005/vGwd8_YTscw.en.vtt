pass<00:01:58.420> through<00:01:58.750> section<00:01:59.550> that's<00:02:00.550> fast<00:02:00.880> that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
pass through section that's fast that

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.210 
pass through section that's fast that
means<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.780> wheel<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.260> good<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:02.979> should

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
means that wheel is good so you should

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.360 
means that wheel is good so you should
buy<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.400> lot<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.700> these<00:02:04.200> bulk<00:02:05.200> then<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:06.220> go<00:02:06.340> over

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
buy a lot of these bulk then we go over

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.050 
buy a lot of these bulk then we go over
here<00:02:06.760> do<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.450> socket<00:02:07.900> peg<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:09.280> bearing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
here do the socket peg and the bearing

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.509 
here do the socket peg and the bearing
on<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> other<00:02:11.049> side<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.500> don't<00:02:12.070> really<00:02:12.220> grind

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519

on the other side I don't really grind
with<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.760> set<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.510> paint<00:02:14.110> ends<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
with this set I just do paint ends and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.190 
with this set I just do paint ends and
hitchhikers<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.549> let<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.570> Jordan<00:02:17.019> yasha

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
hitchhikers and let little Jordan yasha

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.190 
hitchhikers and let little Jordan yasha
tricky<00:02:17.680> stuff<00:02:18.000> then<00:02:19.000> we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
tricky stuff then we

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.110 
tricky stuff then we
exchange<00:02:22.200> from<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> fork<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.220> wheels<00:02:23.880> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
exchange from the fork and wheels and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.190 
exchange from the fork and wheels and
pegs<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.320> golden<00:02:25.860> Phoenix<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.630> so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
pegs to the golden Phoenix it's so

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.250 
pegs to the golden Phoenix it's so
regret<00:02:28.530> tape<00:02:28.770> defines<00:02:29.670> its<00:02:30.270> nice<00:02:30.510> curves<00:02:30.990> and

gold and texture to the feeling that

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.230 
gold and texture to the feeling that
