necessary<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> fear<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.060> while<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
necessary and the fear is that while the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
necessary and the fear is that while the
number<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.560> personnel<00:02:04.979> continues<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> receive

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
number of personnel continues to receive

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.389 
number of personnel continues to receive
the<00:02:06.570> number<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.170> these<00:02:07.350> unnecessary<00:02:07.680> arms<00:02:08.280> on

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the number of these unnecessary arms on

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.509 
the number of these unnecessary arms on
the<00:02:08.520> ground<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:09.270> grow

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
the ground will grow

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.940 
the ground will grow
so<00:02:11.519> why<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.989> much<00:02:13.110> disorganisation

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
so why is there so much disorganisation

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.130 
so why is there so much disorganisation
with<00:02:14.489> something<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:14.970> important<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.959> this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
with something so important like this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
with something so important like this
going<00:02:16.349> on<00:02:16.530> who's<00:02:16.799> responsible<00:02:17.459> for<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
going on who's responsible for the the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.080 
going on who's responsible for the the
day-to-day<00:02:18.239> monitoring<00:02:19.079> of<00:02:19.200> these<00:02:19.349> weapons

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
day-to-day monitoring of these weapons

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
day-to-day monitoring of these weapons
Lindsay<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.269> really<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.599> most<00:02:21.750> important

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
Lindsay that's really the most important

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.750 
Lindsay that's really the most important
question<00:02:22.439> that<00:02:22.470> seems<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:22.890> come<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.220> mind<00:02:23.459> in

the reason this mess is ongoing right

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.839 
the reason this mess is ongoing right
now<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.340> Department<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.790> Defense

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
now is because the Department of Defense

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.780 
now is because the Department of Defense
in<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.750> u.s.<00:02:49.019> uses<00:02:49.290> these<00:02:49.590> two<00:02:49.920> systems<00:02:50.250> one

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
in the u.s. uses these two systems one

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.759 
in the u.s. uses these two systems one
of<00:02:51.209> them<00:02:51.389> are<00:02:51.629> tracking<00:02:52.109> shipping<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
of them are tracking shipping and the

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.399 
of them are tracking shipping and the
other<00:02:52.920> tracking<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.790> receiving<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.690> weapons

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
other tracking the receiving of weapons

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.899 
other tracking the receiving of weapons
on<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.739> ground<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.519> turns<00:02:56.730> out<00:02:56.849> that

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
on the ground and it turns out that

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.759 
on the ground and it turns out that
these<00:02:57.180> two<00:02:57.359> systems<00:02:57.599> are<00:02:57.959> not<00:02:58.139> even<00:02:58.409> linked

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
these two systems are not even linked

is that this report has discovered is
that<00:03:10.139> information<00:03:10.590> often<00:03:11.069> does<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.730> match

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
that information often does not match

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.449 
that information often does not match
theirs<00:03:12.629> duplicated<00:03:13.290> information<00:03:13.889> and<00:03:14.069> that

theirs duplicated information and that

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.280 
theirs duplicated information and that
really<00:03:14.669> the<00:03:14.849> database<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.540> incomplete<00:03:16.109> and

really the database is incomplete and

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.780 
really the database is incomplete and
just<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> give<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.799> some<00:03:16.829> more<00:03:17.220> numbers<00:03:17.400> that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
just to give you some more numbers that

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
just to give you some more numbers that
this<00:03:18.260> report<00:03:19.260> this<00:03:19.379> review<00:03:19.590> has<00:03:19.980> discovered

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
this report this review has discovered

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.720 
this report this review has discovered
is<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.790> around<00:03:21.260> 417<00:03:22.370> thousand<00:03:23.370> serial

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
is that around 417 thousand serial

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.369 
is that around 417 thousand serial
numbers<00:03:24.000> recorded<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.569> just<00:03:24.780> one<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.230> these

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
numbers recorded in just one of these

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.800 
numbers recorded in just one of these
systems<00:03:25.680> over<00:03:26.579> forty<00:03:27.030> percent<00:03:27.419> of<00:03:27.599> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
systems over forty percent of the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.099 
systems over forty percent of the
information<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.739> missing<00:03:29.340> or<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.389> duplicated

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
information is missing or is duplicated

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.509 
information is missing or is duplicated
so<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.349> can<00:03:31.560> imagine<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.980> mean<00:03:32.099> obviously

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
so you can imagine I mean obviously

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.490 
so you can imagine I mean obviously
these<00:03:32.849> are<00:03:32.910> serious<00:03:33.299> serious<00:03:33.690> numbers<00:03:34.260> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
these are serious serious numbers and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.439 
these are serious serious numbers and
that<00:03:34.709> you're<00:03:35.459> basically<00:03:35.790> saying<00:03:35.879> that<00:03:36.150> tens

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
that you're basically saying that tens

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.390 
that you're basically saying that tens
of<00:03:36.569> thousands<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.139> serial<00:03:37.500> numbers<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:38.220> no

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
of thousands of serial numbers have no

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.309 
of thousands of serial numbers have no
shipping<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.970> receiving<00:03:39.359> dates<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
shipping and receiving dates so it's a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.920 
shipping and receiving dates so it's a
mess<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:41.340> Afghanistan<00:03:41.970> we<00:03:42.480> also<00:03:42.629> have<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
mess and in Afghanistan we also have a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.569 
mess and in Afghanistan we also have a
situation<00:03:43.169> where<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.889> report<00:03:44.549> has

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
situation where this report has

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.789 
situation where this report has
discovered<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.260> often<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.379> case<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.769> that

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
discovered that often the case is that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.189 
discovered that often the case is that

or<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:51.930> Excel<00:03:52.410> sheets<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:53.099> obviously<00:03:53.430> there's

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
or in Excel sheets so obviously there's

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.939 
or in Excel sheets so obviously there's
no<00:03:53.730> unified<00:03:54.659> system<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.349> that's<00:03:55.650> what's<00:03:55.829> been

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
no unified system and that's what's been

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.309 
no unified system and that's what's been
creating<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:57.030> mess<00:03:57.269> well<00:03:58.079> yeah<00:03:58.230> it

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
creating this this mess well yeah it

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.899 
creating this this mess well yeah it
sounds<00:03:58.620> sounds<00:03:58.949> merely<00:03:59.310> if<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.639> is<00:03:59.790> all<00:03:59.879> true

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
sounds sounds merely if this is all true

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.369 
sounds sounds merely if this is all true
it<00:04:00.180> sounds<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.449> me<00:04:00.510> like<00:04:00.569> someone<00:04:01.109> needs<00:04:01.260> to

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
it sounds to me like someone needs to

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.220 
it sounds to me like someone needs to
take<00:04:01.530> some<00:04:01.709> s<00:04:01.829> Excel<00:04:02.280> spreadsheet<00:04:02.760> lessons

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
take some s Excel spreadsheet lessons

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.899 
take some s Excel spreadsheet lessons
they<00:04:04.230> teach<00:04:04.409> that<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.799> think<00:04:04.949> this<00:04:05.069> is<00:04:05.129> cost<00:04:05.430> 101

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
they teach that I think this is cost 101

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.699 
they teach that I think this is cost 101
now<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.299> is<00:04:06.419> not<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.690> first<00:04:06.720> time<00:04:07.049> poor

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
