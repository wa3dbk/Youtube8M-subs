you have dry to combination skin I'd say

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
you have dry to combination skin I'd say
more<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> dry<00:00:26.699> side<00:00:26.730> than<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> oily<00:00:27.599> side

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
more on the dry side than the oily side

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
more on the dry side than the oily side
though<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> boil<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
though if you boil this can like I do it

for<00:01:20.040> me<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.520> longevity<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.360> now<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
for me the longevity of it now like I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
for me the longevity of it now like I
said<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.610> drier<00:01:23.909> skin<00:01:24.270> type<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
said I think for drier skin type this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
said I think for drier skin type this
would<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> perfect<00:01:26.130> foundation<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
would be the perfect foundation and I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
would be the perfect foundation and I
don't<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> sample<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.560> don't

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
know if I said this why don't have the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.450 
know if I said this why don't have the
sample<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> show<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.460> actually

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
I feel like when I buff it in is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
I feel like when I buff it in is
sometimes<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.880> cling<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.360> my<00:01:45.479> dry

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
sometimes it will cling to my dry

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.749 
sometimes it will cling to my dry
patches<00:01:47.479> ignore<00:01:48.479> my<00:01:48.600> phone<00:01:48.780> alarm<00:01:49.049> um<00:01:49.759> but

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
patches ignore my phone alarm um but

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
patches ignore my phone alarm um but
since<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.570> such<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> hydrating<00:01:52.380> foundation

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
since it was such a hydrating foundation

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
since it was such a hydrating foundation
I<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.220> didn't<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.850> problem<00:01:53.880> when

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I really didn't have that problem when

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.370 
I really didn't have that problem when
using<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.320> Sigma<00:01:55.500> f80<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.140> not<00:01:58.140> for

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
using the Sigma f80 with it so not for

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.440 
using the Sigma f80 with it so not for
my<00:01:58.530> skin<00:01:58.770> type<00:01:59.009> again<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.790> very<00:02:00.119> oily

to<00:02:03.750> dry<00:02:03.899> skin<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.530> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to dry skin I think would be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
to dry skin I think would be
son<00:02:05.130> foundation<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.150> recommend<00:02:06.180> you
