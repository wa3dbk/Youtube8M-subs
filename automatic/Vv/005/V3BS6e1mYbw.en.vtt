00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.210 
all right let's do frontside tail rolls
this<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.850> switch<00:00:06.810> version<00:00:07.319> are<00:00:07.500> real<00:00:07.890> fun

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this and the switch version are real fun

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.400 
this and the switch version are real fun
ones<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:09.300> might<00:00:09.450> actually<00:00:09.660> find<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.170> switch

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
ones you might actually find the switch

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
ones you might actually find the switch
version<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.950> little<00:00:11.070> easier<00:00:11.580> because<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.940> nose

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
version a little easier because the nose

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.789 
version a little easier because the nose
of<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.330> boards<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.750> usually<00:00:12.870> softer<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
of the boards are usually softer and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.400 
of the boards are usually softer and
this<00:00:14.190> press<00:00:14.580> takes<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.540> lot<00:00:15.839> more<00:00:15.870> effort<00:00:16.199> than

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
this press takes a lot more effort than

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.730 
this press takes a lot more effort than
say<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> frontside<00:00:17.550> or<00:00:17.730> backside<00:00:17.760> nose<00:00:18.420> roll

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.710
