brought<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> probably<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:46.140> placeholder<00:00:46.739> so

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
brought the probably like placeholder so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
brought the probably like placeholder so
I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.610> quite<00:00:47.820> interesting<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.719> can

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I think this is quite interesting we can

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.160 
I think this is quite interesting we can
see<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> LFR<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.430> 25<00:00:50.910> levels<00:00:51.600> behind

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
see that LFR is now 25 levels behind

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.880 
see that LFR is now 25 levels behind
normal<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.969> fair<00:00:54.270> enough<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
normal I think that's fair enough and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.410 
normal I think that's fair enough and
it's<00:00:55.890> definitely<00:00:56.550> Blizzard<00:00:56.969> saying<00:00:57.210> if

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
it's definitely Blizzard saying if

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
it's definitely Blizzard saying if
you're<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> normal<00:00:57.870> Raider<00:00:58.260> Norville's<00:00:59.100> all

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you're a normal Raider Norville's all

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.740 
you're a normal Raider Norville's all
you<00:00:59.399> need<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.640> don't<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.180> need<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> grind

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you need you don't really need to grind

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
you need you don't really need to grind
through<00:01:00.989> LFR<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> think<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.010> good

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
through LFR and I think that's good

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
through LFR and I think that's good
because<00:01:02.629> getting<00:01:03.629> people<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.140> their

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because getting people to do their

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740 
because getting people to do their
normal<00:01:04.500> aggression<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.640> full<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.270> set<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
normal aggression and a full like set of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.460 
normal aggression and a full like set of
LFR<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.500> probably<00:01:08.159> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> burn<00:01:08.850> people<00:01:09.060> out

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
LFR is probably going to burn people out

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
LFR is probably going to burn people out
as<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.710> flex<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:12.060> better

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
as for flex it's a little bit better

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
as for flex it's a little bit better
than<00:01:12.510> LF<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:12.990> still<00:01:13.619> quite<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> ways<00:01:14.130> behind

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
than LF are still quite a ways behind

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.170 
than LF are still quite a ways behind
normal<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.450> suppose<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.380> make<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.180> sort

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
normal I suppose that's to make it sort

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.030 
normal I suppose that's to make it sort
of<00:01:18.240> de-emphasized<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:19.140> normal<00:01:19.470> Raiders<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
of de-emphasized for normal Raiders to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.100 
of de-emphasized for normal Raiders to
go<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.640> flex<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.479> oral<00:01:21.840> because

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
go and do flex and an oral because

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.530 
go and do flex and an oral because
that'll<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:23.009> crazy<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that'll be a little bit crazy but it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.179 
that'll be a little bit crazy but it
still<00:01:24.840> gives<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.200> people<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.710> nice<00:01:25.890> little

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
still gives the people a nice little

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
still gives the people a nice little
gear<00:01:26.430> advantage<00:01:26.850> over<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> ala<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.600> people

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
gear advantage over the ala for people

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
gear advantage over the ala for people
so<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.530> good<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.280> then

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so I think that's quite good and then

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910 
so I think that's quite good and then
heroics<00:01:29.850> 556<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.409> much<00:01:31.560> exactly

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
heroics 556 which is pretty much exactly

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
heroics 556 which is pretty much exactly
what<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.610> would<00:01:32.729> expect<00:01:33.229> now<00:01:34.229> another<00:01:34.590> tweet

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979

request stuff so we can get to the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.880 
request stuff so we can get to the
current<00:03:44.970> content<00:03:45.480> they<00:03:45.870> said<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.320> 5.0

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
current content they said that the 5.0

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.400 
current content they said that the 5.0
and<00:03:47.130> 5.1<00:03:47.640> items<00:03:48.180> will<00:03:48.390> drop<00:03:48.720> from<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.080> throne

of thunder a lavar and they've also drop

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.990 
of thunder a lavar and they've also drop
at<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:52.050> significantly<00:03:53.040> higher<00:03:53.100> chance<00:03:53.670> from

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
at a significantly higher chance from

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.350 
at a significantly higher chance from
the<00:03:54.470> tier<00:03:55.470> 14<00:03:55.890> LFR<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.880> assume<00:03:57.180> not

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
the tier 14 LFR I assume not

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.140 
the tier 14 LFR I assume not
significantly<00:03:57.959> higher<00:03:58.170> than<00:03:58.200> current<00:03:59.150> the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
significantly higher than current the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.680 
significantly higher than current the
last<00:04:00.360> thing<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.110> Flex<00:04:01.530> raid<00:04:01.920> system<00:04:02.690> so

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
last thing is the Flex raid system so

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.840 
last thing is the Flex raid system so
they<00:04:03.810> said<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.380> Flex<00:04:05.070> raid<00:04:05.370> lockout

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
they said that the Flex raid lockout

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.880 
they said that the Flex raid lockout
will<00:04:06.030> work<00:04:06.239> similar<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:06.750> LFR<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.350> terms<00:04:07.620> of

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
will work similar to LFR in terms of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.979 
will work similar to LFR in terms of
repeating<00:04:08.340> bosses<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.239> can<00:04:09.360> go<00:04:09.480> back<00:04:09.510> use

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
repeating bosses so you can go back use

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.990 
repeating bosses so you can go back use
more<00:04:10.230> bonus<00:04:10.590> rules<00:04:10.830> perhaps<00:04:11.459> get<00:04:11.700> trashed

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
more bonus rules perhaps get trashed

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.850 
more bonus rules perhaps get trashed
strokes<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.510> kind<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.930> thing<00:04:13.140> now<00:04:13.620> there<00:04:13.769> is

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
strokes that kind of thing now there is

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.949 
strokes that kind of thing now there is
one<00:04:13.890> unique<00:04:14.370> thing<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.970> say<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.269> are<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:15.900> a

12-person group you kill the boss just
the<00:04:18.600> first<00:04:18.810> boss<00:04:18.989> yeah<00:04:19.200> kill<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.650> first<00:04:19.830> boss

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
the first boss yeah kill the first boss

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.770 
the first boss yeah kill the first boss
you<00:04:20.609> then<00:04:20.760> leave<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.180> on

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
you then leave that on

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.810 
you then leave that on
join<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.230> 20-person<00:04:22.830> group<00:04:23.130> now<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.610> may

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
join a 20-person group now you may

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.129 
join a 20-person group now you may
actually<00:04:23.970> have<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.330> kill<00:04:24.480> a<00:04:24.600> boss<00:04:24.840> again

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
actually have to kill a boss again

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.990 
actually have to kill a boss again
because<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.800> one<00:04:26.070> person<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.610> this<00:04:26.760> new

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
because of one person in this new

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.820 
because of one person in this new
20-person<00:04:27.570> rate<00:04:27.840> hasn't<00:04:28.110> killed<00:04:28.440> by<00:04:28.590> boss

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
20-person rate hasn't killed by boss

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.290 
20-person rate hasn't killed by boss
then<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.250> whole<00:04:29.460> rate<00:04:29.700> will<00:04:29.880> have<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.150> kill

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
then the whole rate will have to kill

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.750 
then the whole rate will have to kill
again<00:04:30.510> so<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.530> suppose<00:04:31.860> that's<00:04:32.160> probably<00:04:32.610> what

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
again so I suppose that's probably what

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.700 
again so I suppose that's probably what
people<00:04:33.090> would<00:04:33.180> expect<00:04:33.600> but<00:04:33.960> it's<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.560> nice

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
people would expect but it's just nice

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.950 
people would expect but it's just nice
to<00:04:34.740> have<00:04:34.950> some<00:04:35.190> solid<00:04:35.430> confirmation<00:04:36.180> that's

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
to have some solid confirmation that's

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.400 
to have some solid confirmation that's
it<00:04:37.139> for<00:04:37.169> today's<00:04:37.500> show<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:38.240> do<00:04:39.240> plan<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.690> trying

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
it for today's show I do plan on trying

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.680 
it for today's show I do plan on trying
to<00:04:40.560> get<00:04:40.650> into<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.919> LFR<00:04:41.250> soon<00:04:41.669> I've<00:04:42.180> been

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
to get into the LFR soon I've been

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.240 
to get into the LFR soon I've been
trying<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.230> trying<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.680> trying<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.160> trying

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
trying and trying and trying and trying

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.370 
trying and trying and trying and trying
and<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.730> just<00:04:44.970> cannot<00:04:45.240> get<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.630> character<00:04:46.020> copied

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
and I just cannot get a character copied

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.470 
and I just cannot get a character copied
over<00:04:46.620> how<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.220> can't<00:04:47.550> even<00:04:47.760> log<00:04:47.910> into<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.330> thing

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
over how I can't even log into the thing

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.570 
over how I can't even log into the thing
I<00:04:48.600> get<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> 117<00:04:49.500> era<00:04:49.620> which<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.010> quite<00:04:50.340> bizarre

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
I get a 117 era which is quite bizarre

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.340 
I get a 117 era which is quite bizarre
so<00:04:51.389> I'm<00:04:51.480> not<00:04:51.600> really<00:04:51.750> sure<00:04:51.840> what<00:04:52.080> I'm<00:04:52.139> going<00:04:52.290> to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
so I'm not really sure what I'm going to

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.110 
so I'm not really sure what I'm going to
do<00:04:52.500> about<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.710> but<00:04:53.040> I<00:04:53.070> would<00:04:53.190> definitely<00:04:53.550> get

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
do about that but I would definitely get

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.920 
do about that but I would definitely get
some<00:04:54.150> first-hand<00:04:54.960> coverage<00:04:55.790> of<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.060> PTR<00:04:57.600> but

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
some first-hand coverage of the PTR but

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.530 
some first-hand coverage of the PTR but
anyway<00:04:58.290> until<00:04:58.470> then<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.760> the<00:05:00.150> current<00:05:00.419> model

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
anyway until then the the current model

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.690 
anyway until then the the current model
of<00:05:00.720> things<00:05:00.930> will<00:05:01.140> have<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.770> so<00:05:02.340> thank<00:05:02.610> you
