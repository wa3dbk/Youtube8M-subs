self-defense

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.230 
self-defense
what<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> lacking<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:05.030> longer<00:01:06.030> range

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
what is it lacking well longer range

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.200 
what is it lacking well longer range
self<00:01:06.540> defence<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> ammo<00:01:08.220> capacity<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:09.060> with

self defence and ammo capacity now with

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
self defence and ammo capacity now with
claps<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> could<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> 33<00:01:10.439> round

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
claps you could get the 33 round

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.490 
claps you could get the 33 round
magazines<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> low<00:01:13.229> point

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
magazines so that's kind of a low point

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
magazines so that's kind of a low point
but<00:01:14.960> with<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.110> fake<00:01:16.290> aid<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.850> goes<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
300 yards fairly easily this will go out

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.300

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
obviously if I was defending my home I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.780 
obviously if I was defending my home I
would<00:01:45.090> pick<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> over<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> Glock<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.140> day
