from<00:00:07.260> the<00:00:07.350> spring<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.340> Newfield

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700

main and i'm going to show you a few
other<00:00:11.100> ways<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.550> test<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> water<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.480> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
other ways that I test the water so that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.720 
other ways that I test the water so that
I<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.720> get<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> gauge<00:00:13.680> of<00:00:14.010> the<00:00:14.160> quality<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
water I want to be really clear that

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.980

things like chemicals that wheat from
from<00:00:25.890> our<00:00:26.010> environment<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:27.270> here<00:00:27.570> in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
from our environment I know here in

from our environment I know here in
Maine<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> springs<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.590> become

contaminated with mtbe which is a
gasoline<00:00:31.650> additive<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.970> I<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.420> guarantee

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
gasoline additive so I can guarantee

that<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.330> contaminate<00:00:36.600> water<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.350> things

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that can contaminate water are things

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.069 
that can contaminate water are things
like<00:00:37.860> bacteria<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.540> can't<00:00:39.899> guarantee

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
like bacteria which I can't guarantee

with any of these meters either but what
I<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.420> check<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.079> things<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.410> for

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I can check out is things like for

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.970 
I can check out is things like for
instance<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.190> pH<00:00:44.840> pH<00:00:45.840> stands<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.469> potential

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
instance the pH pH stands for potential

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.040 
instance the pH pH stands for potential
of<00:00:47.100> hydrogen<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> measure<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.840> how

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of hydrogen and it's the measure of how

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.950 
of hydrogen and it's the measure of how
acid<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.590> alkaline<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> water<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.750> that's<00:00:51.750> a

neutral and we want to be somewhere in
that<00:01:02.070> area<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.690> past<00:01:03.989> seven<00:01:04.559> towards<00:01:04.890> 14

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that area as we go past seven towards 14

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.400 
that area as we go past seven towards 14
we<00:01:05.520> have<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.090> alkaline<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.289> got

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
we have more and more alkaline if we got

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.050 
we have more and more alkaline if we got
all<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.649> up<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> 14<00:01:08.130> 14<00:01:08.460> would<00:01:08.580> burn<00:01:08.819> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
all the way up to 14 14 would burn you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.029 
all the way up to 14 14 would burn you
it's<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.539> alkaline<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.500> actually<00:01:10.770> begin<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
it's so alkaline but actually begin to

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.430 
it's so alkaline but actually begin to
dissolve<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.520> oils<00:01:11.759> of<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.209> skin<00:01:12.539> if<00:01:13.259> we

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
dissolve the oils of your skin if we

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.430 
dissolve the oils of your skin if we
went<00:01:13.590> down<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.550> seven<00:01:15.000> towards<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.780> would

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
went down from seven towards one would

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.469 
went down from seven towards one would
be<00:01:16.560> getting<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> low<00:01:17.459> acid<00:01:17.819> pH<00:01:18.450> which

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
be getting into a low acid pH which

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.449 
be getting into a low acid pH which
would<00:01:18.869> also<00:01:18.929> burn<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> stay

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
would also burn you we want to stay

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.910 
would also burn you we want to stay
somewhere<00:01:20.849> around<00:01:21.209> seven<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.530> let's<00:01:22.679> check

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
somewhere around seven so let's check

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
somewhere around seven so let's check
that<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.399> digital<00:01:23.580> ph<00:01:23.970> meter<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.330> can

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that this is a digital ph meter you can

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.290 
that this is a digital ph meter you can
buy<00:01:24.599> this<00:01:24.660> on<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> internet<00:01:26.039> for<00:01:26.190> about<00:01:26.300> say

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
buy this on the internet for about say

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.059 
buy this on the internet for about say
about<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.539> hundred<00:01:27.780> dollars<00:01:28.349> this<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.830> a<00:01:28.860> great

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
about a hundred dollars this is a great

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:30.499 
about a hundred dollars this is a great
tool<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.789> use<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:29.970> not<00:01:30.149> only<00:01:30.300> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tool because you can use it not only to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.839 
tool because you can use it not only to
check<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.590> pH<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.190> water<00:01:32.399> but<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> can

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
check the pH of your water but you can

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.249 
check the pH of your water but you can
use<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.209> check<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> pH<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.990> own<00:01:34.110> urine

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
use it to check the pH of your own urine

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.559 
use it to check the pH of your own urine
you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.099> use<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.520> check<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> pH<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.209> things

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
you can use it to check the pH of things

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.449 
you can use it to check the pH of things
that<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> ding<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.649> of

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
that you are from that ding or of

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.070 
that you are from that ding or of

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.280 
to before that weren't quite as clean
this<00:02:14.189> is<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> TDS<00:02:15.000> meter<00:02:15.299> you<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.810> buy<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.049> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
this is a TDS meter you can buy this I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.449 
this is a TDS meter you can buy this I
bought<00:02:16.409> this<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:16.799> ebay<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.189> about

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
bought this one on ebay for about

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.559 
bought this one on ebay for about
sixteen<00:02:18.030> dollars

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
sixteen dollars

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.869 
sixteen dollars
this<00:02:19.409> measures<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.829> total<00:02:20.219> dissolved<00:02:20.849> solids

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
this measures the total dissolved solids

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.800 
this measures the total dissolved solids
in<00:02:21.689> water<00:02:22.200> that's<00:02:22.409> what<00:02:22.560> tds<00:02:22.920> stand<00:02:23.189> for<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in water that's what tds stand for the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.360 
in water that's what tds stand for the
dissolved<00:02:25.200> solids<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.650> things<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.129> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
dissolved solids are things like that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.920 
dissolved solids are things like that
those<00:02:26.609> are<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> ions<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.420> are<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.719> water

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
those are the ions that are in the water

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.979 
those are the ions that are in the water
that's<00:02:28.349> things<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.650> calcium<00:02:28.980> magnesium

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
that's things like calcium magnesium

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.770 
that's things like calcium magnesium
sodium<00:02:30.989> potassium<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:33.060> more<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.420> those<00:02:33.540> that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
sodium potassium the more of those that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.270 
sodium potassium the more of those that
are<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.049> water<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.499> harder<00:02:34.859> that<00:02:35.040> water

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
are in the water the harder that water

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.949 
are in the water the harder that water
is<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.579> you'll<00:02:35.909> hear<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.269> sometimes<00:02:36.659> hard

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
is so you'll hear that sometimes hard

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.259 
is so you'll hear that sometimes hard
water<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.859> a<00:02:38.010> house<00:02:38.159> has<00:02:38.400> hard<00:02:38.700> water<00:02:38.969> they'll

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
water if a house has hard water they'll

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.629 
water if a house has hard water they'll
usually<00:02:39.540> install<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> water<00:02:40.469> softener<00:02:40.889> which

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
usually install a water softener which

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.250 
usually install a water softener which
pulls<00:02:41.969> some<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.329> those<00:02:42.420> things<00:02:42.689> out<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
pulls some of those things out of the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.539 
pulls some of those things out of the
water<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:45.379> distilled<00:02:46.379> water<00:02:46.709> or<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> reverse

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
water a distilled water or a reverse

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.520 
water a distilled water or a reverse
osmosis<00:02:47.760> water<00:02:48.329> pulls<00:02:48.719> a<00:02:48.840> lot<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.079> those<00:02:49.200> ions

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
osmosis water pulls a lot of those ions

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.619 
osmosis water pulls a lot of those ions
as<00:02:49.709> well<00:02:49.859> so<00:02:50.400> sometimes<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.969> lot<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.329> times

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
as well so sometimes a lot of the times

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.360 
as well so sometimes a lot of the times
people<00:02:51.840> will<00:02:51.959> buy<00:02:52.109> a<00:02:52.139> TDS<00:02:52.560> meter<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.950> check<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
people will buy a TDS meter to check the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.270 
people will buy a TDS meter to check the
quality<00:02:53.549> or<00:02:53.909> to<00:02:54.269> check<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.950> viability<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> the

filter<00:02:56.699> that<00:02:56.969> they're<00:02:57.150> using<00:02:57.419> so<00:02:58.169> if<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.379> had

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530

filter that they're using so if you had
a<00:02:58.819> reverse<00:02:59.819> osmosis<00:03:00.060> filter<00:03:00.750> from<00:03:00.870> time<00:03:01.079> to

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
a reverse osmosis filter from time to

mineral water so a lot of times if you

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.599 
mineral water so a lot of times if you
see<00:03:28.409> like<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> Perrier<00:03:29.009> or<00:03:29.280> something<00:03:29.519> like

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
see like a Perrier or something like

see like a Perrier or something like

that that's a mineral water that would

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.159 
that that's a mineral water that would

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the unsafe zone 0 to 20 like I said

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.830 
the unsafe zone 0 to 20 like I said
would<00:03:41.729> be<00:03:41.849> distilled<00:03:42.239> that'd<00:03:42.449> probably<00:03:42.659> be

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
would be distilled that'd probably be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.599 
would be distilled that'd probably be
eats<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:43.379> clean<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.919> wouldn't<00:03:44.129> really<00:03:44.189> want<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
eats so clean we wouldn't really want to

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.009 
eats so clean we wouldn't really want to
drink<00:03:44.790> that<00:03:44.879> I<00:03:45.030> would<00:03:45.269> actually<00:03:45.569> be<00:03:45.689> a<00:03:45.720> water

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
drink that I would actually be a water

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.569

that<00:03:46.169> would<00:03:46.259> strip<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.829> lot<00:03:47.009> of<00:03:47.129> minerals<00:03:47.280> out

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
that would strip a lot of minerals out

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.530 
that would strip a lot of minerals out
of<00:03:47.759> our<00:03:47.879> body<00:03:48.560> we're<00:03:49.560> at<00:03:49.650> 31<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.609> doesn't<00:03:51.449> get

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
much better than that we're really lucky

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.470 
much better than that we're really lucky
to<00:03:52.889> have<00:03:53.009> a<00:03:53.159> spring<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.729> around

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
to have a spring like that around

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.480 
to have a spring like that around
great
