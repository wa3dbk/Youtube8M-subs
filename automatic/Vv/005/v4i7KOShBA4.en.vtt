because<00:02:05.740> there's<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:06.549> many<00:02:06.670> boats<00:02:07.000> around<00:02:07.359> us

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
because there's so many boats around us

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.749 
because there's so many boats around us
you<00:02:07.630> can't<00:02:07.990> get<00:02:08.470> away<00:02:08.590> from<00:02:08.739> them<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.340> if<00:02:09.640> you

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you can't get away from them and if you

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
you can't get away from them and if you
fall<00:02:10.030> off<00:02:10.060> you're<00:02:10.539> tangled<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.080> anchor<00:02:11.440> lines

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
fall off you're tangled and anchor lines

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.990 
fall off you're tangled and anchor lines
and

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.350 
and

yeah we're fishing in a spot today
that's<00:03:23.390> not<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.750> supposed<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.230> deep

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that's not really supposed to be deep

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.130 
that's not really supposed to be deep
enough<00:03:25.740> for<00:03:25.800> sturgeon<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.640> fairly<00:03:27.140> nobody

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
enough for sturgeon but fairly nobody

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.770 
enough for sturgeon but fairly nobody
told<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.590> fish<00:03:28.800> that

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
told the fish that

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.080 
told the fish that
oh<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.470> many<00:03:31.680> boats<00:03:31.980> on<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.250> river<00:03:32.370> sometimes

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
oh so many boats on the river sometimes

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.800 
oh so many boats on the river sometimes
it<00:03:33.350> makes<00:03:34.350> sense<00:03:34.680> to

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
it makes sense to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.809 
it makes sense to
go<00:03:36.290> somewhere<00:03:36.740> where<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.100> boats<00:03:37.280> aren't<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
go somewhere where the boats aren't and

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.340 
go somewhere where the boats aren't and
that<00:03:37.940> was<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.240> plan<00:03:38.480> today<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.140> worked

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
going to keep it running I think we're

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.870 
going to keep it running I think we're
going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.760> see<00:04:08.000> him<00:04:08.180> here<00:04:09.310> he's<00:04:10.310> running<00:04:10.730> that

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
going to see him here he's running that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:27.010 
going to see him here he's running that
way<00:04:13.030> he's<00:04:14.030> running<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.600> way<00:04:23.470> probably<00:04:26.020> he

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
way he's running that way probably he

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.050 
way he's running that way probably he
went<00:04:27.229> these<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.890> that<00:04:28.070> way<00:04:28.310> so<00:04:30.610> yeah<00:04:31.610> their

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
went these going that way so yeah their

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.310 
went these going that way so yeah their
lines<00:04:32.330> are<00:04:32.540> coming

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.500 

I<00:04:38.410> think<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.280> might<00:04:39.490> have<00:04:39.610> been<00:04:39.700> him<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.180> begin

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
I think it might have been him to begin

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.570 
I think it might have been him to begin
with<00:04:40.780> there<00:04:41.170> was<00:04:41.260> tail<00:04:41.560> right<00:04:41.890> there<00:04:41.950> wasn't

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
with there was tail right there wasn't

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.090 
with there was tail right there wasn't
there<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:47.680> don't<00:04:47.800> feel<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.130> buzzing<00:04:48.430> do<00:04:48.820> you

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
there you don't feel a buzzing do you

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.950 
there you don't feel a buzzing do you
buzzing<00:04:51.360> like<00:04:52.360> like<00:04:52.840> buzzing<00:04:53.320> on<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.590> rod

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
buzzing like like buzzing on the rod

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.800 
buzzing like like buzzing on the rod
that's<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.320> two<00:04:56.470> together

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810
