that we've covered here we've covered
six<00:00:48.960> orders<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> magnitude<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> performance

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
six orders of magnitude and performance

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
six orders of magnitude and performance
you<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> factor<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.960> million<00:00:52.289> here's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you know a factor of a million here's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
you know a factor of a million here's
where<00:00:53.070> else<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.550> get<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.030> something

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
like that and it's forced us to reinvent

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
like that and it's forced us to reinvent
ourselves<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.930> over<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.559> over

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and over again and that's been very

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
and over again and that's been very
intrinsically<00:01:01.710> rewarding<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.579> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
intrinsically rewarding you know it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
intrinsically rewarding you know it's
fun<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.329> go<00:01:03.480> invent<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.229> new<00:01:04.500> things<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
fun to go invent these new things and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.640 
fun to go invent these new things and
work<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.790> different<00:01:06.119> stuff<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:07.200> because

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
work on this different stuff but because

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
work on this different stuff but because
I<00:01:07.680> cast<00:01:08.070> myself<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:09.060> engineer<00:01:09.600> more<00:01:10.020> than

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I cast myself as an engineer more than

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
I cast myself as an engineer more than
some<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.799> research<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.490> scientist<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
some kind of a research or scientist on

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
some kind of a research or scientist on
there<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> service

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
there it does have to be in the service

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.200 
there it does have to be in the service
of<00:01:14.490> creating<00:01:14.970> something<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.479> value<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:17.400> lot

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of creating something of value and a lot

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.660 
of creating something of value and a lot
of<00:01:18.330> people<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.860> games<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.400> some

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
of people like to look at games as some

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.450 
of people like to look at games as some
form<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.030> art<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
form of art something like that but you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
form of art something like that but you
know<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> there's<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:25.049> better

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
know I do think that there's a better

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.560 
know I do think that there's a better
metric<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.369> value<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.970> create<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
metric for the value that we create and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
metric for the value that we create and
that's<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.990> millions<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> people<00:01:28.710> are

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that's that millions of people are

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
that's that millions of people are
willing<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.490> pay<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.880> our<00:01:29.909> games<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
willing to pay for our games that you

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
willing to pay for our games that you
know<00:01:31.590> people<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> choice<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.640> what<00:01:32.820> they

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
know people have a choice of what they

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.910 
know people have a choice of what they
spend<00:01:33.119> their<00:01:33.390> money<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.200> they've<00:01:34.560> decided

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
spend their money on and they've decided

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
spend their money on and they've decided
that<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.579> gaming<00:01:35.790> experiences<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> can

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that the gaming experiences that we can

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.319 
that the gaming experiences that we can
provide<00:01:37.439> our<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.950> better<00:01:38.460> use<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.820> their<00:01:39.119> money

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
provide our a better use of their money

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.080 
provide our a better use of their money
more<00:01:39.810> provide<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.500> value<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.220> than<00:01:41.790> all
