00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.830 
don't know what my actual gun she was in
the<00:01:59.520> end<00:01:59.700> cuz<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.390> own<00:02:00.420> nuclear

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.240 
the end cuz I get my own nuclear
around<00:02:02.840> halfway<00:02:03.350> through<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> game<00:02:04.010> I<00:02:04.070> think

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
around halfway through the game I think

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.149 
around halfway through the game I think
halfway<00:02:04.820> yeah<00:02:05.690> I'd<00:02:05.960> have<00:02:06.170> nits<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> second

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
halfway yeah I'd have nits in a second

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.310 
halfway yeah I'd have nits in a second
round<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.370> get<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.640> but<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.720> first<00:02:08.990> round<00:02:09.200> is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
round I get it but the first round is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.470 
round I get it but the first round is
pretty<00:02:09.740> it's<00:02:10.399> pretty<00:02:10.459> slow<00:02:10.910> paced<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.330> guess

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
pretty it's pretty slow paced I guess

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.750 
pretty it's pretty slow paced I guess
you<00:02:11.570> could<00:02:11.600> say<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.350> don't<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.430> didn't<00:02:13.670> get

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you could say on I don't I didn't get

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760 
you could say on I don't I didn't get

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and swarm in the round and then in the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.990 
and swarm in the round and then in the
second<00:02:18.110> round<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.320> get<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:18.650> four<00:02:19.430> swarms<00:02:19.850> or

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
second round I get like four swarms or

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
second round I get like four swarms or
something<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.830> yeah<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> they

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
something like that but yeah and they

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
something like that but yeah and they
definitely<00:02:23.110> definitely<00:02:24.110> put<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.740> work<00:02:24.860> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
definitely definitely put in work I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.400 
definitely definitely put in work I
think<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:26.240> my<00:02:26.390> opinion<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.900> think<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
think in my opinion I think that the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.520 
think in my opinion I think that the
dogs<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:27.920> more<00:02:28.570> separate<00:02:29.570> they're<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:29.930> that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
dogs are more separate they're not that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.680 
dogs are more separate they're not that
great<00:02:30.740> of<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.760> killstreak<00:02:32.060> like<00:02:32.360> I'd<00:02:32.480> rather

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
great of a killstreak like I'd rather

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.900 
great of a killstreak like I'd rather
use<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.110> load<00:02:33.290> stock<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.520> warship

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
use the load stock and the warship

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.760 
use the load stock and the warship
together<00:02:35.270> but<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.320> dogs<00:02:36.530> them

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
together but if you have dogs them

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.680 
together but if you have dogs them
together<00:02:37.070> then<00:02:37.340> they're<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:37.880> amazing<00:02:38.000> dogs

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.050 
killstreaks early in the game and yeah
make<00:05:27.949> sure<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.070> get<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.310> killstreaks<00:05:28.729> early

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
make sure you get the killstreaks early

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.909 
make sure you get the killstreaks early
and<00:05:29.300> then<00:05:29.419> once<00:05:30.110> you<00:05:30.199> get<00:05:30.320> your<00:05:30.410> first<00:05:30.590> set

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
and then once you get your first set

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.710 
and then once you get your first set
like<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:31.400> have<00:05:31.550> here<00:05:31.580> you<00:05:32.270> can<00:05:32.419> just<00:05:32.449> keep

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
like I have here you can just keep

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.360 
like I have here you can just keep
rolling<00:05:33.199> through<00:05:33.410> him<00:05:33.500> maybe<00:05:33.919> we<00:05:34.039> get<00:05:34.190> like<00:05:34.310> a

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
rolling through him maybe we get like a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.370 
rolling through him maybe we get like a
couple<00:05:34.610> kills<00:05:34.910> each<00:05:35.090> time<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.539> here<00:05:36.169> my

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
couple kills each time and here my

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.920 
couple kills each time and here my
friend<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:37.130> in<00:05:37.340> my<00:05:37.430> party<00:05:37.789> he<00:05:38.360> called<00:05:38.630> it<00:05:38.780> his

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
friend is in my party he called it his

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.629 
friend is in my party he called it his
stuff<00:05:39.199> so<00:05:39.229> I'm<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.770> upgraded<00:05:40.130> tapping<00:05:40.550> the

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
stuff so I'm just upgraded tapping the

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.129 
stuff so I'm just upgraded tapping the
button<00:05:40.789> and<00:05:41.150> I<00:05:42.110> think<00:05:42.440> this<00:05:42.530> happens<00:05:42.860> twice<00:05:44.139> so

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
button and I think this happens twice so

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.260 
button and I think this happens twice so
if<00:05:45.470> he<00:05:45.590> didn't<00:05:45.860> have<00:05:46.310> these<00:05:46.490> or<00:05:46.729> whatever<00:05:47.000> I

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
if he didn't have these or whatever I

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.779 
if he didn't have these or whatever I
probably<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.530> think<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:48.889> even<00:05:48.979> overlapped<00:05:49.520> on<00:05:49.669> my

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
probably I think I even overlapped on my

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.300 
probably I think I even overlapped on my
own<00:05:49.909> dogs<00:05:50.210> was<00:05:50.419> warm<00:05:50.659> but<00:05:51.159> anyway<00:05:52.159> if<00:05:52.220> he

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
own dogs was warm but anyway if he

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.620 
own dogs was warm but anyway if he
didn't<00:05:52.520> have<00:05:52.610> his<00:05:52.729> up<00:05:52.940> I<00:05:53.090> could<00:05:53.300> have<00:05:53.389> made<00:05:53.510> me

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
didn't have his up I could have made me

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.050 
didn't have his up I could have made me
got<00:05:53.780> more<00:05:53.930> kills<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.460> said<00:05:55.460> I<00:05:55.490> had<00:05:55.669> left<00:05:55.909> her

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
got more kills I said I had left her

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.689 
got more kills I said I had left her
dogs<00:05:56.300> in<00:05:56.510> him<00:05:56.630> but<00:05:56.810> anyway<00:05:57.050> back<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.409> him

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
dogs in him but anyway back to him

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.629 
dogs in him but anyway back to him
