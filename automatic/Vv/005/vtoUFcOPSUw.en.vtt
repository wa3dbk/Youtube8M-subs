00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.149
 traditionally it's November 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.069
 account kill pigs 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.529
 it saved the farmers from feeding them 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.360
 during the winter the ports of the valley 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 have fattened well and the local butcher 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.270
 nil james came to office 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.710
 slaughter yatela bombole drawing yes 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.660
 it's good you did not waste 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.840
 a lot 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 excellent they do not love each other anymore 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.269
 still where to go in the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 small farms to kill the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.960
 pigs they surely knew how 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 do not over stress the animal 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 to do it humanly but you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.059
 where they live they are 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.750
 much quieter and far away 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.850
 to be so scared they are in their 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 habitat so they are not afraid to be 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860
 lugged in trucks or that kind 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860
 things 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.670
 the fate of a freshly killed animal is 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.370
 very useful I do not throw I go in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.360
 to make good as soon is the ingredient 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.640
 main 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.520
 I'm doing at clubs there is more than 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.960
 pour the blood on it for me 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 later when I will have to clean the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 hoses they will serve us envelope for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:19.560
 the sausages I take that I will say 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 to the guys kidnapped to help us alex stuart 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 wants to help them get past that pig 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 the time of history we were not content 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.530
 not to send a port to the slaughterhouse and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.610
 recover well packed chops 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 the slaughter of the pig and its preparation 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.270
 was a serious job and all the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.270
 world on the farm lent his hand 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.390
 inside we clean the butts in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.299
 which will macerate the organs of the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.340
 port I will also put some salt 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.750
 for more security to be sure 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.030
 the meat does not yield anything that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.770
 would look like a bacterium have to be well 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.390
 brushed to get to the bottom of each 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:14.819
 small wood crack near 3 2 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:17.220
 what is one where an old saying 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.670
 says that the only part of the pig that does not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.730
 do not eat it's his scream here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 the intestine a real envelope on 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.099
 can fill sausage meat or 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 pudding you like sausages 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.560
 I love it yes yes I really want a 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 bacon sandwich for dinner but in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.540
 five minutes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.310
 ruth should be able to give you taste 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 of an inside there is what we 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.069
 call the strainer we talk about it in the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 old recipes it looks like a 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.329
 resin exactly in the craft one says 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.900
 that if we take it out correctly 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.760
 it looks like south america but 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.840
 I'm afraid I made holes 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.970
 it's very popular very beautiful in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.829
 crepinette I do it myself they are 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.239
 very soft 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.390
 I put it aside we will use it more 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.390
 late 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.610
 I leave the other white kidneys 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:25.020
 he is between the legs and as it is 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.690
 a boar he has 2 I hope in fact the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.520
 white kidneys these are the balls 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:36.990
 it is a very very delicate dishes 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:39.330
 appreciated the louvre is a very good 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.210
 white flesh 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.560
 I just have to push like this and that 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.290
 should go out alone from the envelope 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 of skin that delicious jump with salt 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.750
 and pepper slightly farid we have our 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.230
 pig it's not just about the 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.270
 cut 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
 we must first get rid of bristles 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.470
 and the thamourth seven ancient breeds 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.790
 from a boar cross is 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.370
 much hairier than the time 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.860
 current without modern machines 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.910
 they will try the old method the 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.190
 burning preserve meat 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.690
 salty ace and smoke we have to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.500
 remove all the self while leaving 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.360
 intact skin 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.010
 he will surely make the bright and 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.049
 around the ears or remove until 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:25.230
 last point I think I'm going 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.970
 backward it takes little excellent it's a 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.820
 first I had never seen that this is 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.810
 different we normally we the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.450
 let's make boiling water 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.840
 everything is done to the machine have aggrieved 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.250
 boiling then we scrape the evenings I 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.790
 already seen my dad do it with a 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.620
 blowpipe 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.620
 but that's completely different 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.070
 the fire gives off a lot of heat back 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.960
 is almost finished that's fine we can 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.270
 push 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.270
 that's another second d 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:07.300
 yes except for this place under the chin on 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.040
 go on their tour yet go my big ah 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.470
 if it worked well for the moment 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.910
 the hairs are seen the only problem 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.530
 it's getting to find the quad 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.480
 balance for batteries and without them 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.160
 begin to cook they must not be 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.190
 cook we just want to flambe them either to 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.470
 this stage but I think it works 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.450
 is still much to do and moved 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.950
 a dead pig weighing more than 100 kg 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.950
 requires a great effort 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:40.420
 [Music] 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.420
 no 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.660
 now that he has no hair 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.680
 he stays at the high schools are alive but 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:06:11.820
 not cooperative 2 3 what do these 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:13.950
 the two here are bravo to keep the 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.920
 skin must be cleaned before 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:23.550
 salage all the swiss needs to be brushed 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:25.140
 and rinse and will never be so white 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.860
 that if we had it brilliant and as we 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.790
 does it today but that's our side 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.380
 non culation the vertebra 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.690
 although a professional is charged 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.580
 of slaughter four hundred years ago 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:45.980
 it was the farmer who proceeded to 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:50.640
 butchering operations and that's a set 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.000
 she returns to you hand in hand in a pool 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.130
 of blood 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.050
 you see all the lavialle there is 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.540
 in the head there is plenty behind and 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.980
 also in the days we often say that 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.169
 it's the best bit this little 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.770
 part i'll maybe do them 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:07.230
 marinate in the sum and it's very good 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.610
 once properly salted and smoked a 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.590
 pig like this one could feed 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:14.010
 for three months a family of six 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.810
 people all brains foot 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.810
 was treated and eat
