00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.049
 Sasha today we have another lesson we 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 today we will approach more difficult 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.520
 exercise travel snake in position 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.810
 standing landing sitting 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.670
 these elements are very complex and one more 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.730
 element we will have the passage 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.890
 turns acceleration braking and at the end 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 workouts we will master the elements 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 tracks are already on the track 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.000
 before starting the exercises i 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.160
 I repeat everything that passed on past 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.610
 lessons fast acceleration sudden braking 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.710
 riding standing and entering a turn and need it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.930
 give yourself a bike to warm up yourself 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 warm up otherwise it will stall 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.329
 go to the first task for today 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 acceleration braking is fulfilled for 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 to the athlete 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.530
 could reach as close as possible to the rotation and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 as close as possible to it by braking 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.969
 use that is and on the gathering on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.570
 speeds do not enter the turn well and give 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.670
 at maximum speed before that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 the steeper the racer the closer to the turn he 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.049
 can drive up at maximum speed 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 on such cities just get lost 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.150
 precious seconds my task is to delay 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.189
 gas until the maneuver and an abruptly 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.390
 slow down enter a turn and so 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.390
 abruptly get out of it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.539
 they certainly have no end and edge and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.390
 progress and limited meaning for everyone 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.149
 there is always an opportunity to raise the level 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.700
 and the most important thing is that unlike the first 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.909
 classes are now the speed of age here 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.159
 Already more with cute began to go and more 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.920
 Already we are more confident today as 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.680
 training 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.140
 has a progression think this is next 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.900
 exercise we learn to maneuver everything 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.790
 the famous snake looks easy by itself 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.939
 you will not try again many movements 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.640
 which are not visible from the replacement of legs 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.039
 one leg second leg and motorcycle 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.530
 you work you cant motorcycle in this 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.239
 side to side 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.459
 Comes you work with a motorcycle 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.489
 bend over here tilted slightly 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.310
 you pull your leg forward not from him but 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.830
 Sensei him go here and so let your hands 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.700
 lower ok you have to with him like her 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.190
 whole dust 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.799
 Itâ€™s easy to get central chips 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.540
 at the extreme you need to take a bigger radius I 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.870
 I didn't do it all the time 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:44.060
 endured stas and try to bends 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:47.900
 run a motorcycle cant bike already 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.940
 Manage became more so in all 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.280
 exercise 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.330
 which we did probably started kayala 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.300
 then not much 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.060
 I'm sure collecting Sinai on the psychological 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.620
 plan like that squeak essay end begin 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.460
 appear some kind of controllability and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.420
 ease and 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.600
 already more easier and more excitement appears 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.760
 how to make the same snake infusion I 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.100
 Already could not tiredness makes itself felt 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.890
 and sympathize with muscle tension 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.640
 better stop classes otherwise great 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.640
 risk of injury 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.570
 the conclusion I had a long-awaited 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.730
 opportunity to ride on this 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.580
 race track novices on such 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.920
 difficult track do not allow here some buds 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.240
 springboards and sand pits paradise for 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.460
 present extremal 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.770
 but for me they made an exception novel 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.200
 found the lightest sections and of them 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.150
 made my trophy route 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 there are few areas with juicy 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 so on the sand 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.740
 the plots will be more difficult titan ride 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.580
 the bike will sail well we are both called 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.580
 I personally tried to wait for this moment 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.580
 drove 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.030
 there was a springboard on my site 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.160
 he was not allowed to me yet dangerous but 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.830
 section of sandy tracks properly 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.690
 raised adrenaline my ride 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.920
 turned out successful kiraman decided 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.840
 complicate the task 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:15.060
 adding a few sharp turns on 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.549
 the track has no time to think when to change 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.160
 center of gravity or what leg to expose 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.110
 it should be on automatism you need everything 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.660
 time to follow the route so as not to 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.660
 skip the turn and fly out in quad 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.470
 so I felt all that real 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.620
 extreme and behind what made these 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.000
 exercise your studies one circle on 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.760
 track and hot eyes 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.550
 although no I understand it was the most bitter 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.320
 section of the track very much today 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.380
 so that at least his hand on the track is already 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.410
 began to go and I saw how you started 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.110
 as soon as we had a beginning 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.510
 that is, we can say that a person is from scratch 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.270
 completely started from scratch on this 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.570
 motorcycle and overcame whether drove across 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.570
 track
