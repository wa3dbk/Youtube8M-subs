00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
an LPS tuber I'm using the computer a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.370 
an LPS tuber I'm using the computer a
lot<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.059> fact<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> main

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so editing and using the computer is a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.260 
so editing and using the computer is a
daily<00:00:42.899> habit<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.489> computer<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
daily habit and the computer kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.760 
daily habit and the computer kind of
represents<00:00:45.840> Internet<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.770> love

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the Internet and I think it's an awesome

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
the Internet and I think it's an awesome
place<00:00:52.620> where<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.160> endless

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
place where there's endless

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
place where there's endless
possibilities<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> also<00:00:55.199> goes<00:00:55.530> along

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
possibilities so that also goes along

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.700 
possibilities so that also goes along
with<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.850> next<00:00:57.059> emoji<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
with it to the next emoji is the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.650 
with it to the next emoji is the
recycling<00:00:59.250> emoji<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> guys

into<00:01:02.699> nature<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.320> think<00:01:04.710> recycling<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> one

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
into nature and I think recycling is one

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670 
into nature and I think recycling is one
of<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> easiest<00:01:06.600> ways<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.320> help<00:01:07.470> out

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of the easiest ways you can help out

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.880 
of the easiest ways you can help out
nature<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> love<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.600> recycle<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.590> trash

nature so I love to recycle and do trash

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.039 
nature so I love to recycle and do trash
cleanups<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.570> sounds<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.990> cheesy

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
cleanups I know it sounds kind of cheesy

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.640

you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.830> helping<00:01:14.250> out<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.240> nature<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> such

a<00:01:16.680> pretty<00:01:17.130> place<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> think<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> one

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
a pretty place and I think this is one

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
a pretty place and I think this is one
emoji<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.799> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> represent<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> all

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
emoji that can kind of represent it all

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
emoji that can kind of represent it all
in<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> well<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> mean<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.619> guess<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.040> earth

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
in one well I mean I guess the earth

feel<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.750> writing<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.320> such<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> beautiful

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
feel like writing is such a beautiful

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.709 
feel like writing is such a beautiful
way<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> express<00:02:05.850> yourself<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> it's

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
way to express yourself and it's

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.290 
way to express yourself and it's
probably<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.560> most<00:02:07.979> easiest<00:02:08.670> way<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:08.970> me<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
probably the most easiest way for me to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.720 
probably the most easiest way for me to
express<00:02:09.660> myself<00:02:09.929> rather<00:02:10.860> than<00:02:11.009> talking<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
express myself rather than talking I

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.250 
express myself rather than talking I
feel<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> pour<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.690> all<00:02:13.020> my

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
feel like it can you pour out all my

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.770 
feel like it can you pour out all my
emotion

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
emotion

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.530 
emotion
onto<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> paper<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.770> think<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:16.180> city

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
onto the paper I think that the city

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.020 
onto the paper I think that the city
emoji<00:02:16.990> represents<00:02:17.620> me<00:02:17.709> perfectly<00:02:18.190> because<00:02:18.550> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
emoji represents me perfectly because I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.090 
emoji represents me perfectly because I
grew<00:02:19.420> up<00:02:19.450> in<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> city<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.470> city<00:02:20.830> girl

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
grew up in the city I was a city girl

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.090 
grew up in the city I was a city girl
and<00:02:21.459> I've<00:02:22.330> never<00:02:22.840> really<00:02:23.290> been<00:02:23.410> away<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.950> it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
and I've never really been away from it

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.150 
and I've never really been away from it
so<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> huge<00:02:25.300> part<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.720> my<00:02:25.840> life<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.470> live
