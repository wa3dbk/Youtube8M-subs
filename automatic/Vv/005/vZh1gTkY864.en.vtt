 like colored tennis shoes and I also 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.030
 I put on a very simple black T-shirt and 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.220

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.379
 already after I had to go for my dress 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.479
 for the event then my friends said 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:45.150

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.639
 I literally arrived with a troop 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.289

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.930
 I also look for what I want to put 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.030
 because I takes me much time 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.740
 I got 2000 dresses and I do not know if you guys 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.639
 They are equal to me but I looked at everything and 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 I take the first destination 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.530

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.090

 It was green but I do not know 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.590
 convinced then in the end I found a 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.080
 dress that I loved that I had like 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.560
 leather and combined with a vest 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.210
 black hair that I loved here and I was going 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.310
 late to fix myself because I take more 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.680

 home and I started to fix very very fast 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.999
 then he tells me like intense eyes 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.129
 I think it's very important that the 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.870
 skin is super cute for photos and 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:38.879
 I made myself pretty in my hair 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.500
 can see how the environment darkened 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.419
 when I was putting on makeup because 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.039
 it got dark then here is me 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.650

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.340
 and had already advanced work for the 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.620
