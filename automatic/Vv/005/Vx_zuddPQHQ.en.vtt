 I idassi sleep us company pult.ru 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.880
 My name is Yevgeny Ermolayev and now you 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.020
 I will tell about floor acoustic 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.480
 magnat monitor supreme 2000 2 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.470
 Tycoon company has German roots and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.730
 known for being a music lover 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 decent products for a reasonable price 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.000
 2000 2 is the older model lineup 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.170
 equipped with four drivers which 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
 front view 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.079
 three-way construction for low 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 frequencies correspond to two identical low 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.559
 Nick frequencies 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.329
 200 millimeters per average 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.800
 frequencies 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 is at the top of the midrange 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.510
 size 170 mm due to high 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.399
 frequencies and distinguishes a dome tweeter 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 silk dome and a diameter of 25 millimeters 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.820
 local look carefully then 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.440
 interesting construction on a bush not 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 only in terms of the number of lanes 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 but even outwardly made special 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.390
 antifriction chamfer on the perimeter of okusi 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 crossing over rounded corners and this is not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.939
 just above the design and allows you to improve 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.729
 the sound of even the serious nuances of the panel such 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 systems we see two large pairs of topaz 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 wind and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 quite simple but seriously screw 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.490
 terminals not allowing connection 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.380
 stuffed but not here 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030
 Acoustics sufficiently accessible 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.829
 and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 assume it will work with a 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.390
 you are receivers and amplifiers boss 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 on a category where it is as soon as possible 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.030
 all this system is not useful 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.390
 designed for fairly large areas 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 its resistance becomes 4 8 ohm 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.899
 power supplied up to 450 20 minimum on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.990
 30 watt very impressive range 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.310
 frequencies from 18 hertz sensitive 93 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 decibel and that respectively with 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320
 inexpensive devices 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.420
 will make it sound serious 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.490
