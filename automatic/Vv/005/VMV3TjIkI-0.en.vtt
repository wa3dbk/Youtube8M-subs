00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.209
 I welcome all fans of the network 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.650
 battles in touch there sperm whales and today 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.450
 we will talk about what is now 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.410
 happening on test servers 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.540
 battlefield 4 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.670
 and if specifically the latest version 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.920
 community maps like you most likely 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.930
 know for several months, days i 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.630
 lay work on a map based on 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.039
 player feedback over the development period to us 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.379
 several times given the opportunity 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.809
 try this card to be honest I already 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.489
 I do not remember some version of the account but 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.050
 apparently that's the way it will be 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 look ultimately 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.550
 now everywhere dense vegetation and 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.589
 it looks like real jungle if not 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.210
 I am mistaken the real location that they are 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.670
 took as a basis is located somewhere on 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.260
 Sumatra is to say what this looks like 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.629
 the card is really beautiful 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.190
 something like cards and deals tea 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.559
 raising but with more dense 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.389
 vegetation and unfortunately i have to 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.909
 say that personally for me on this her 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:03.440
 advantage end let's start with 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.780
 that despite its rather not 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.030
 small size this map is calculated 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.500
 on infantry battles technique here 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 present but it is first and foremost 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.910
 acts as a vehicle in 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.230
 each team has a bp at 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.300
 transport helicopter 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.430
 and several other small transport 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.590
 in the beginning there were even tanks here 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.330
 but they apparently decided to refuse to 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 shift the emphasis towards infantry 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.410
 battles so here when it comes to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.330
 infantry battles the same 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.520
 vegetation which is the main 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.200
 The chip of this card is simultaneously 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.510
 the biggest pain in the ass 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.430
 bushes of course do not protect you from bullets 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.080
 but may well hide you from sight 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.120
 adversary and vice versa 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.860
 in the video you can see how 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.930
 several times it happened either me 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.850
 ran past the enemy and and he had not 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.340
 absolutely no clue what I'm around 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.980
 either the enemy jumped out of the bushes right at the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.900
 me in the face at the last second 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.460
 this happens most often at point c where 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 vegetation is particularly dense 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.080
 in some places here literally not 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.270
 seen farther than your nose when you try 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.040
 seize this flag then opponents don't 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.409
 not only visible because they are sitting 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.840
 somewhere far in the bushes but because 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.069
 bushes everywhere around you and some 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.079
 hefty leaf misha 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.099
 I'll see at least something when 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.930
 you look in sight 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.030
 and when you try to go out for more 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.040
 a good place to shoot something for you 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.560
 immediately opens fire from 10 different 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.540
 directions on this flag there is another 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.670
 a bit more secure shelter 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.219
 namely huts but keep in mind that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.469
 the walls of these huts fly away even from 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.629
 conventional small arms and again the same 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.239
 and leave you completely open 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.189
 now while moving on this map 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.109
 you need to check not only all possible 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.510
 corners of which you can open 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.430
 fire but every bush on the subject of 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.889
 don't sit there any Vietnamese 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.689
 partisans but again it's my personal 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.909
 impressions and maybe I'm completely 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.340
 I am mistaken and everyone will like this 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.439
 card if you plan to spend a lot 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.120
 time on this card is now on test 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.189
 servers or when it comes out 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.590
 the main game then without fail 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.870
 use a silencer no matter what 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.819
 always use a weapon in your hands 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.439
 miniature silencer is the most reliable 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.780
 tool by which you can 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.459
 navigate in these thickets and if 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.930
 you will not glow on the mini map 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.299
 the enemy will be in your hands 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.220
 a huge advantage of course not 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.509
 it's worth remembering that the muffler is very 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.060
 greatly reduces the initial speed 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.680
 flight bullets and if you're going to lead 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.840
 long range shooting 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.129
 which of course are here 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.530
 get ready to face some 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.329
 difficulties but the muffler will have quite 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.790
 by the way if you are going to capture 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.250
 for example the point d on which is located 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.500
 the real maze of huts or that 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.139
 same point c which we said a little bit 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.810
 before another problem is the distance 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.479
 between flags between points b c and d 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.370
 relatively short distance if you 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.470
 want to spend as little time as possible 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.150
 moving between flags is better 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.470
 you stay in the area here 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.810
 actually occur the most 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.299
 intense shootout but as for 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.459
 points to her and they are far away 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.889
 not that from each other but even 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.199
 central area where there are b c and 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.969
 d transport on this card is not so 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.280
 a lot and the movement may take 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.840
 a lot of time and let's not forget that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.639
 due to local vegetation 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
 notice opponents quite difficult 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.599
 let's say you run through the jungle and 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.459
 stumble on one opponent or 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.620
 a whole squad that may well be 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.109
 time to react will 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.120
 minimum 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.909
 and as you yourself understand, nothing good is 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.740
 will not end either the same other scenario you 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.629
 run across the open area and you 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.849
 open fire from any thickets 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:31.889
 and most likely they will kill you sooner than you 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.629
 you can understand where they shot at all 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.030
 I doubt anyone will like it 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.189
 run for about a minute just to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.080
 to die from nowhere and when 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.219
 this without killing a single opponent and not 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.530
 getting to the flag 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:45.870
 drivers of equipment here will also have to 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.150
 hard being in t-re see 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.979
 opponents is quite difficult and easy 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.889
 You can overlook any support 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.449
 who throws 4 on your btr either 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.759
 same engineer who decided to run 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.370
 rocket from the bushes while you fire 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.719
 the place where the rocket came from 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 the enemy can easily move to 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.490
 another point and you won't even notice 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.750
 due to limited visibility and exactly 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.969
 same as in infantry battles 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.099
 here it will be much harder for you to understand 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.500
 where does the enemy shoot than others 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.960
 road maps here of course there 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.969
 but most of the map is covered with hills and 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.889
 move on them on armored vehicles not 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:22.379
 quite convenient so if you are 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.539
 in bt this is an opportunity for movement 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.789
 you will be somewhat limited and rather 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.680
 all you can be more efficient 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.779
 if you move on your own two 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.029
 some moments of course can still 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:34.919
 change to release cards but this is unlikely 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.550
 there will be something that will greatly affect the 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.379
 gameplay 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.330
 most likely like all the cards from 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.860
 additions and it will be popular first 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.289
 few weeks after release 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.879
 and then they will all forget though who 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.009
 probably knows those moments that 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:48.900
 others seemed to me problems 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.150
 seem positive features of this 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.800
 cards and it will be popular enough 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.259
 for a long time as they say 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.150
 wait and see and the last thing you want 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.849
 say about this card today 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.229
 this is something that was recently announced 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.419
 voting for priority 2 mode 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.669
 which will be available here like 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.069
 nothing special but as we showed 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.819
 example bf4 mode will not work 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.680
 as intended 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.319
 if you just shove it on some 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.419
 map they design a map specifically 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.159
 under this mode if the developers 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.349
 announced voting means they 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.419
 initially did not know what the second mode 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:23.520
 would like to see here and did not plan 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.370
 card under it let's say it will be 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.370
 rush I think many people remember how bad 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.960
 worked rush in bf4 at the start not even on 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.970
 start in the first year of life bf4 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.669
 and it is quite possible that rush on this map 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.169
 repeat the fate of everyone else but can 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.210
 be i just imagining the worst 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.930
 the script and the developers are well aware 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.599
 what are they doing 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.180
 again wait and see well and on this 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.889
 perhaps I must write everything 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.650
 in the comments what do you think about this 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:53.050
 map and what fate do you expect it and 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.940
 of course if you found out today for 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.979
 yourself something new or just 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.620
 had a good time don't forget to rate 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.319
 video thank you very much for watching not 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.509
 forget to subscribe to the channel with you was 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.509
 tank slot and see you next video
