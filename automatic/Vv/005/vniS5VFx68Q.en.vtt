the<00:01:10.140> pole<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.710> woman<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.400> X<00:01:14.420> notice<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.540> we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the pole to the woman be X notice if we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
the pole to the woman be X notice if we
label<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.110> way<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.979> length<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
label it this way the length of the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.380 
label it this way the length of the
shadow<00:01:17.750> would<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> longer<00:01:19.530> length<00:01:19.740> Y

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
shadow would be the longer length Y

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.730 
shadow would be the longer length Y
minus<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.420> shorter<00:01:21.780> length<00:01:21.990> X<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.680> Y<00:01:23.520> minus<00:01:23.880> X

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.990 

now<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> woman<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.520> walking<00:01:29.670> at<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
now because the woman is walking at a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.700 
now because the woman is walking at a
speed<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> 4<00:01:30.630> feet<00:01:30.810> per<00:01:31.110> second

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
speed of 4 feet per second

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130 
speed of 4 feet per second
that<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.490> how<00:01:32.670> fast<00:01:32.939> X<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.600> changing

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that would be how fast X is changing

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.520 
that would be how fast X is changing
therefore<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.220> DX<00:01:35.700> DT<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:37.229> change

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
therefore we know that DX DT the change

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
therefore we know that DX DT the change
in<00:01:37.710> X<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.159> respect<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> T<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> equal<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
in X with respect to T is equal to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.370 
in X with respect to T is equal to
positive<00:01:40.079> 4<00:01:40.790> feet<00:01:41.790> per<00:01:42.030> second<00:01:42.479> X<00:01:43.200> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
positive 4 feet per second X is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
positive 4 feet per second X is
increasing<00:01:43.770> therefore<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.000> is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
increasing therefore we know this is

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.929 
increasing therefore we know this is
positive<00:01:46.100> we<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.250> want<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> determine<00:01:47.700> how

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
positive we also want to determine how

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.850 
positive we also want to determine how
fast<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.630> tip<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> our<00:01:49.079> shadow<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> moving

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
fast the tip of our shadow is moving

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
fast the tip of our shadow is moving
which<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.640> 45<00:01:51.270> feet<00:01:51.299> from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> base<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
which is 45 feet from the base of the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
which is 45 feet from the base of the
pole<00:01:52.590> which<00:01:53.490> means<00:01:53.820> when<00:01:54.030> x<00:01:54.210> equals<00:01:54.390> 45<00:01:55.170> or<00:01:56.540> 45

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
pole which means when x equals 45 or 45

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
pole which means when x equals 45 or 45
feet<00:01:57.840> to<00:02:00.740> determine<00:02:01.740> how<00:02:01.890> fast<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> tip<00:02:02.430> of

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
feet to determine how fast the tip of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.840 
feet to determine how fast the tip of
our<00:02:02.610> shadow<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> moving<00:02:03.390> when<00:02:03.930> x<00:02:04.110> equals<00:02:04.200> 45<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
our shadow is moving when x equals 45 we

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.169 
our shadow is moving when x equals 45 we
can<00:02:06.030> find<00:02:06.299> how<00:02:06.600> fast<00:02:06.840> Y<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.229> changing<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:08.009> dy<00:02:08.729> DT

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
can find how fast Y is changing or dy DT

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.430 
can find how fast Y is changing or dy DT
so<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.259> goal<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> find<00:02:10.860> dy<00:02:11.280> DT

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so it goal is to find dy DT

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.430 
so it goal is to find dy DT
now<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:13.980> need<00:02:14.160> an<00:02:14.250> equation<00:02:14.460> relating<00:02:14.970> X&amp;Y<00:02:15.900> so

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
now we need an equation relating X&amp;Y so

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.540 
now we need an equation relating X&amp;Y so
we<00:02:16.530> can<00:02:16.680> then<00:02:16.830> find<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> derivative<00:02:17.460> with

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
we can then find the derivative with

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.310 
we can then find the derivative with
respect<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> T<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:18.540> then<00:02:18.990> use<00:02:19.200> this

so<00:02:27.480> looking<00:02:28.140> at<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> larger<00:02:28.620> right<00:02:28.770> triangle

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
so looking at the larger right triangle

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.520 
so looking at the larger right triangle
on<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.430> smaller<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.000> triangle<00:02:30.530> notice

this<00:02:31.830> side<00:02:33.440> corresponds<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.980> side<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.700> we

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
this side corresponds to this side so we

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.870 
this side corresponds to this side so we
can<00:02:36.690> say<00:02:36.930> 18<00:02:37.790> 2<00:02:38.790> 6<00:02:39.290> must<00:02:40.290> equal<00:02:40.740> now<00:02:41.640> again

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
can say 18 2 6 must equal now again

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.900 
can say 18 2 6 must equal now again
looking<00:02:42.120> at<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.450> large<00:02:42.900> right<00:02:43.170> triangle<00:02:43.910> this

looking at the large right triangle this
side<00:02:45.240> here<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.590> would<00:02:46.710> be<00:02:46.890> y<00:02:47.630> must

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
side here which would be y must

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.410

which<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.810> y<00:02:52.320> minus<00:02:52.350> X<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:54.660> can<00:02:54.780> say<00:02:55.610> Y<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.670> 2

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
which is y minus X so we can say Y is 2

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.400 
which is y minus X so we can say Y is 2
y<00:02:57.810> minus<00:02:58.200> X<00:02:59.510> this<00:03:00.510> will<00:03:00.660> be<00:03:00.720> our<00:03:00.900> equation<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
y minus X this will be our equation that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620 
y minus X this will be our equation that
relates<00:03:01.560> X<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.160> y<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.700> let's<00:03:03.300> solve<00:03:03.480> this

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630

relates X and y so let's solve this
equation<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:04.230> y<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:05.160> could<00:03:05.340> simplify<00:03:05.840> 18

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840

let's go ahead and cross multiply and

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.870 
let's go ahead and cross multiply and
solve<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:19.709> y<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> 1<00:03:21.240> times<00:03:21.510> y<00:03:22.250> must<00:03:23.250> equal<00:03:23.400> 3

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
solve for y so 1 times y must equal 3

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.680 
solve for y so 1 times y must equal 3
times<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.660> quantity<00:03:24.780> Y<00:03:25.740> minus<00:03:26.130> X<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.420> again

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
we'd have 1 times y is y must equal 3

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.520 
we'd have 1 times y is y must equal 3
times<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.200> quantity<00:03:31.290> Y<00:03:31.770> minus<00:03:32.160> X<00:03:33.410> let's<00:03:34.410> go

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
ahead and distribute the 3 so we have y

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.360 
ahead and distribute the 3 so we have y
equals<00:03:39.420> 3<00:03:40.200> y<00:03:40.670> minus<00:03:41.670> 3x<00:03:42.560> subtract<00:03:43.560> 3y<00:03:43.890> on<00:03:44.220> both

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
equals 3 y minus 3x subtract 3y on both

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.010 
equals 3 y minus 3x subtract 3y on both
sides<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.820> would<00:03:44.910> give<00:03:44.970> us<00:03:45.239> negative<00:03:45.360> 2<00:03:45.600> y

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
sides that would give us negative 2 y

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.000 
sides that would give us negative 2 y
equals<00:03:46.860> negative<00:03:47.580> 3x<00:03:48.320> divide<00:03:49.320> both<00:03:49.530> sides<00:03:49.830> by

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
equals negative 3x divide both sides by

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.770 
equals negative 3x divide both sides by
negative<00:03:50.160> 2<00:03:52.550> notice<00:03:53.550> how<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
negative 2 notice how we have the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.050 
negative 2 notice how we have the
equation<00:03:55.290> y<00:03:55.530> equals<00:03:56.160> 3<00:03:57.090> halves<00:03:57.300> times<00:03:58.170> X<00:03:59.060> so

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
equation y equals 3 halves times X so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.020 
equation y equals 3 halves times X so
this<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.420> equation<00:04:00.810> relates<00:04:01.170> x<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.709> y<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
this is the equation relates x and y so

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.920 
this is the equation relates x and y so
now<00:04:03.150> we'll<00:04:03.300> find<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.510> derivative<00:04:03.570> with

goal<00:04:52.629> here<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.930> find<00:04:53.169> dy<00:04:53.409> DT<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.099> now<00:04:54.189> we

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:54.249 
goal here is to find dy DT and now we

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.659 
goal here is to find dy DT and now we
can<00:04:54.580> because<00:04:54.969> we<00:04:55.569> know<00:04:55.599> DX<00:04:56.080> DT<00:04:56.409> notice<00:04:57.189> how<00:04:57.340> dy

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
can because we know DX DT notice how dy

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.159 
can because we know DX DT notice how dy
DT<00:04:58.000> is<00:04:58.120> actually<00:04:58.389> going<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.599> be<00:04:58.689> a<00:04:58.719> constant

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
DT is actually going to be a constant

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.290 
DT is actually going to be a constant
based<00:04:59.620> upon<00:04:59.919> how<00:05:00.189> fast<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.699> person<00:05:01.029> is<00:05:01.120> moving

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
based upon how fast the person is moving

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.140 
based upon how fast the person is moving
it's<00:05:01.990> not<00:05:02.139> dependent<00:05:02.439> on<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.979> value<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.340> x<00:05:06.150> so

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
it's not dependent on the value of x so

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.559 
it's not dependent on the value of x so
dy<00:05:07.779> DT<00:05:08.139> in<00:05:08.379> this<00:05:08.529> case<00:05:09.300> it's<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.389> to<00:05:10.449> be

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
dy DT in this case it's going to be

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.939 
dy DT in this case it's going to be
equal<00:05:10.659> to<00:05:10.810> three-halves<00:05:11.729> times<00:05:13.289> DX<00:05:14.289> DT<00:05:14.500> which

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
equal to three-halves times DX DT which

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:21.619 
equal to three-halves times DX DT which
is<00:05:15.129> 4<00:05:15.550> feet<00:05:15.699> per<00:05:16.000> second

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.089

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
notice here the for the to simplify

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:26.219 
notice here the for the to simplify
there's<00:05:24.370> one<00:05:24.610> two<00:05:24.819> and<00:05:24.999> two<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.479> two<00:05:25.539> 2's<00:05:26.050> and

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
there's one two and two and two 2's and

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:33.899 
there's one two and two and two 2's and
four<00:05:26.819> so<00:05:27.819> dy<00:05:28.300> DT<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:31.479> equal<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.900> 6<00:05:32.560> feet<00:05:33.189> per

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
four so dy DT is equal to 6 feet per

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.110 
four so dy DT is equal to 6 feet per
second<00:05:34.389> which<00:05:34.889> is<00:05:35.889> how<00:05:36.189> fast<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.669> tip<00:05:36.879> of<00:05:37.000> her
