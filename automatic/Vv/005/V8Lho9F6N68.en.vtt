with this French legal one side and then

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.140 
with this French legal one side and then
we<00:00:16.830> did<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.400> well<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> previous

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
we did do very very well in the previous

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.609 
we did do very very well in the previous
episode<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.600> come<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.869> against<00:00:19.109> stuff<00:00:19.289> really

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
episode we come up against stuff really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.220 
episode we come up against stuff really
poor<00:00:20.010> side<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.580> not<00:00:20.820> entirely<00:00:21.270> sure<00:00:21.449> whether

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
poor side I'm not entirely sure whether

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
poor side I'm not entirely sure whether
it<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.890> guy's<00:00:23.189> semi-final<00:00:24.000> because

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
it was this guy's semi-final because

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.769 
it was this guy's semi-final because
there<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> no<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.650> team<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.910> Paul<00:00:27.269> been

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
there is no way a team that Paul been

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.450 
there is no way a team that Paul been
able<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.170> into<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> semi-final<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.279> cup

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
able to get into the semi-final of a cup

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
able to get into the semi-final of a cup
so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.300> cross<00:00:30.630> cross

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
so I think it's kind of cross cross

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.889 
so I think it's kind of cross cross
matching<00:00:31.800> us<00:00:31.920> through<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> rounds<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
matching us through the rounds but this

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.590 
matching us through the rounds but this
guy<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> he<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.489> decent<00:00:35.730> enough<00:00:35.969> at<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> game

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
guy and he was decent enough at the game

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.069 
guy and he was decent enough at the game
I<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.920> think<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:39.000> fact<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.300> his<00:00:39.629> chemistry

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
I just think the fact that his chemistry

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
I just think the fact that his chemistry
was<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.440> bad<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:40.980> players<00:00:41.280> were<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.090> poor

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
was so bad and his players were so poor

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.610 
was so bad and his players were so poor
in<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> positions<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.230> were<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.500> he

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
in the positions that they were in he

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.250 
in the positions that they were in he
was<00:00:43.680> playing<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> Sami<00:00:44.309> Khedira<00:00:44.700> at

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
was playing like a Sami Khedira at

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
was playing like a Sami Khedira at
centre-back<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> had<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.800> Luisao<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> think

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
centre-back and had a Luisao I think

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
centre-back and had a Luisao I think
it's<00:00:47.910> got<00:00:48.000> pace<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.300> 48<00:00:48.870> playing<00:00:49.200> him<00:00:49.379> at

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it's got pace like 48 playing him at

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's got pace like 48 playing him at
right-back<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.340> didn't<00:00:50.579> understand

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
right-back I really didn't understand

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.959 
right-back I really didn't understand
his<00:00:51.350> his<00:00:52.350> methods<00:00:52.800> behind<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
his his methods behind it but as you can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.240 
his his methods behind it but as you can
see<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.270> did<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.289> wait<00:00:55.440> until<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> 43rd

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
see we did have to wait until the 43rd

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.619 
see we did have to wait until the 43rd
minute<00:00:56.280> steak<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> one-nil<00:00:57.090> lead<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.510> were

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
minute steak a one-nil lead but we were

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
minute steak a one-nil lead but we were
on<00:00:57.809> top<00:00:58.020> ten<00:00:58.320> shots<00:00:58.590> five<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.460> which<00:00:59.579> were<00:00:59.820> on

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
on top ten shots five of which were on

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
on top ten shots five of which were on
target<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:00.930> half<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:01.649> were

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
target in the first half so we were

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
target in the first half so we were
definitely<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.340> top<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> game<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
definitely on top of the game and in

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.760 
definitely on top of the game and in
control<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.489> five<00:01:05.760> minutes<00:01:05.970> after

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
control but here just five minutes after

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.870 
control but here just five minutes after
after<00:01:07.770> half<00:01:07.920> time<00:01:08.189> he<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.460> out<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> bring<00:01:08.790> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880

the lead till halftime and we might be

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.890

but he did bring it back to 32 just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.089 
but he did bring it back to 32 just
before<00:03:21.810> halftime<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:22.440> Carlos<00:03:22.709> Tevez<00:03:23.010> a

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
before halftime with Carlos Tevez a

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.460 
before halftime with Carlos Tevez a
lovely<00:03:23.430> finish<00:03:23.690> underneath<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.870> goalkeeper

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
lovely finish underneath the goalkeeper

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.470 
lovely finish underneath the goalkeeper
and<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:26.400> brought<00:03:26.519> about<00:03:26.549> three<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> half

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and that brought about three to a half

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240 
and that brought about three to a half
time<00:03:27.659> like<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> saying<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> little<00:03:28.950> bit

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
time like I saying so I was a little bit

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.770 
time like I saying so I was a little bit
nervous<00:03:29.370> players<00:03:29.879> there<00:03:30.150> seemed<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
nervous players there seemed to be a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.509 
nervous players there seemed to be a
little<00:03:31.019> bit<00:03:31.170> agitated<00:03:31.409> arguing<00:03:32.280> amongst

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
little bit agitated arguing amongst

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.800 
little bit agitated arguing amongst
themselves<00:03:32.580> probably<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.360> why<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.569> fact

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
themselves probably about why the fact

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.270 
themselves probably about why the fact
that<00:03:33.870> he<00:03:33.959> had<00:03:34.200> three<00:03:34.440> men<00:03:34.590> against<00:03:34.890> our<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.159> at

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that he had three men against our one at

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.470 
that he had three men against our one at
the<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.730> as<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.269> we<00:03:36.450> have

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the back but as you can see we have

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.089 
the back but as you can see we have
plenty<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.989> ball<00:03:37.140> plenty<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.530> chances<00:03:37.950> and

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
plenty the ball plenty of chances and

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.280 
plenty the ball plenty of chances and
he'd<00:03:38.519> had<00:03:38.700> two<00:03:38.940> shots<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.450> scored<00:03:39.840> them<00:03:40.080> both

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
he'd had two shots and scored them both

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.320 
he'd had two shots and scored them both
so<00:03:40.560> clearly<00:03:40.860> he<00:03:41.099> was<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> clinical<00:03:41.819> finisher<00:03:42.209> so

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
so clearly he was a clinical finisher so

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.270 
so clearly he was a clinical finisher so
I<00:03:42.360> was<00:03:42.480> going<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:42.659> have<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.900> try<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.230> limit<00:03:44.099> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
I was going to have to try and limit the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
I was going to have to try and limit the
amount<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.700> chances<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.269> he<00:03:45.330> had<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.959> to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
amount of chances that he had and to

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.600 
amount of chances that he had and to
start<00:03:46.500> off<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.040> second<00:03:47.370> half<00:03:47.459> I

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
start off with in the second half I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.670 
start off with in the second half I
wasn't<00:03:48.000> able<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.330> do<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.629> nanny<00:03:48.930> here<00:03:49.230> was
