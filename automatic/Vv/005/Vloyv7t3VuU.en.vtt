00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
three sections start twisting this side

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.400 
three sections start twisting this side
and<00:02:36.130> cross<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.329> over<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.720> first<00:02:38.019> side<00:02:38.230> and

head now we're going to repeat the
process<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.660> again<00:02:46.750> divide<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.650> section

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
process and again divide this section

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.460 
process and again divide this section
into<00:02:48.400> two<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.030> we're<00:02:49.930> going<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.320> do
