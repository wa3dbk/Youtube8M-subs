 I want to read please try to do a little 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.620
 It was rumored to be windy overseas 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 crescendo 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.490
 Say 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.970
 Even reckless Shisen-dō to be it is a commodity 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.930
 Yes me I part is not even in the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.290
 That kind of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.500
 Thing 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.580
 And ear plugs It is a manufacturer called crescendo 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:48.370
 And this is often that yellow guy like you can focus the light bulb 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.660
 Also to say whether not you can not concentrate at all I was bought I know I you doing sold in pharmacies 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.960
 Cartoon Yon 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.960
 so 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.950
 That 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.750
 It is often said that that Japanese earplugs that it is Japan, but the yellow guy 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.390
 I'm such 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.260
 The same pattern 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.030
 For example, do you have such experience? 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:17.500
 Someone called me when I was doing some work with that earplug , for example being told by my mom 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.500
 Takayuki says rice 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:29.409
 Yan oh well I gorgeous even Domo picked up does therefore say 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:34.959
 Hear Well, If you do not hear anymore at all in order, but have earplugs at the time were told the rice so in the state 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:42.920
 Also that it called twice eating sound rice to eat is not rice to their is no meaning by I three-wire Once 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:45.650
 The voice of I experience I might be some people that I'm such this great thing people 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.790
 It is made to be easy to hear 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.799
 Yes 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:57.780
 It does not say what comfortably Well can voice conversation of people 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.810
 8 It is in the center of the part and the part of the cheek of the bass 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.770
 It has become the wind, such as to attenuate the sound 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.600
 so 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:10.010
 To say the so-called frequency I'd become the story of this wave of the waveform 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:19.550
 The waveform is like this Naminamina Miami 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:22.860
 It is said that low temperature Asian corn corn is high frequency and father is tens of thousands more times per second 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.830
 Wow that's why I 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.800
 Here is this 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:33.030
 What's up in the area, I can not hear this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.530
 people who are doing a headphone doing much human composers are doing Toka bj 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.700
 Yes another This will also be done ear after that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.640
 People who have always been headphones like Shinjuku 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:47.590
 I will give you the Evenge version 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.590
 I have seen that time or movie it is 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.210
 Rainy day Evangelion from August to August 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.990
 Beneath watching a movie 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:04.230
 8 is the ear is dangerous 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.600
 I 'm still young now, but please try to imagine when you were 50 and 60 . 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.960
 I would like to hear no more 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.530
 In fact even club life long people 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:17.680
 Rather I think has been done 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:20.620
 After all, the ear is a vibration of the tympanic membrane, so it is paralyzed more and more . 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.800
 Because it is gone 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:31.520
 When the previous Diva Disco generation's moveable property is transferred, only the left ear can not be heard 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.470
 I really like Huh by this equipment installation Toka or greater voice I'm Anda

 What barely longer really must-haves are doing this say that wave dissipating now 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.129
 It may be fictional 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.590
 Club culture and kind of do 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:58.420

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:01.810
 Something Yeah, is not it victims can be can experience iodine 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.260
 I wonder if headphones are bad for my ears 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.980
 Is the fact that whether there is a navy with people of Atobando 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:14.340
