quick<00:01:51.600> look<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.130> tells<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.640> how

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
quick look so this just tells you how

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.990 
quick look so this just tells you how
you're<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> use<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.740> device<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
you're going to use the device and it's

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.700 
you're going to use the device and it's
pretty<00:01:57.240> self-explanatory<00:01:57.630> we've<00:01:58.409> got<00:01:58.560> those

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
pretty self-explanatory we've got those

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
pretty self-explanatory we've got those
four<00:01:59.130> LED<00:02:00.090> lights<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> bag<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.350> each<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
four LED lights on the bag and each of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.870 
four LED lights on the bag and each of
those<00:02:02.310> represents<00:02:03.000> 25%<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> charge<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.469> 25<00:02:05.310> 50

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
those represents 25% of charge so 25 50

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 
those represents 25% of charge so 25 50
75<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.079> 100<00:02:07.680> percent<00:02:07.950> charge<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> power

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
75 and 100 percent charge in the power

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.240 
75 and 100 percent charge in the power
scheme<00:02:09.149> now<00:02:10.080> these<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> suction<00:02:11.039> cups

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
scheme now these are the suction cups

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.340 
scheme now these are the suction cups
these<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.300> different

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
these are really different

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.650 
these are really different
and<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.400> lightning<00:02:14.880> connector<00:02:15.300> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and this is the lightning connector and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.660 
and this is the lightning connector and
you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:16.080> here<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> flexible<00:02:17.430> base

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you can see here it's on a flexible base

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.210 
you can see here it's on a flexible base
so<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.930> has<00:02:19.050> obviously<00:02:19.170> got<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> cable<00:02:19.830> going

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
so this has obviously got a cable going

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.310 
so this has obviously got a cable going
through<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.670> flexible<00:02:21.120> base<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.990> what<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
through this flexible base and what this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.840 
through this flexible base and what this
allows<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.100> according<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
allows you to do according to the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.660 
allows you to do according to the
manufacturers<00:02:24.510> use<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.020> with<00:02:25.860> various

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
manufacturers use this with various

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.600 
manufacturers use this with various
cases<00:02:27.030> as<00:02:27.390> well<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.350> I've<00:02:28.590> got<00:02:28.770> my<00:02:28.800> iphone<00:02:29.070> 5

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
cases as well so I've got my iphone 5

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.910 
cases as well so I've got my iphone 5
here<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.150> I've<00:02:31.110> been<00:02:31.260> testing<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.710> for<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
here and I've been testing this for a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140 
here and I've been testing this for a
little<00:02:32.040> while<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.670> basically<00:02:32.850> do

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
little while now what you basically do

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510 
little while now what you basically do
is<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.540> sort<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> connecting<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
is just you sort of connecting to the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.030 
is just you sort of connecting to the
actual<00:02:36.210> battery<00:02:36.540> case<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.740> you<00:02:37.830> push

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
actual battery case and then you push

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.010 
actual battery case and then you push
down<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.520> suction<00:02:38.910> cups<00:02:39.150> grip<00:02:39.510> onto<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
down and the suction cups grip onto the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.350 
down and the suction cups grip onto the
back<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.440> your<00:02:40.530> device<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.090> pretty

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
back of your device see it's pretty

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.690 
back of your device see it's pretty
secure<00:02:42.810> really<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.800> by<00:02:44.070> doing<00:02:44.280> things<00:02:44.520> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
secure really nice by doing things you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.850 
secure really nice by doing things you
can<00:02:44.820> still<00:02:45.030> use<00:02:45.240> your<00:02:45.270> phone<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.870> when<00:02:46.710> you

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
can still use your phone and when you

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
can still use your phone and when you
hit<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.640> button<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> back<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.900> starts

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
hit that button on the back it starts

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.340 
hit that button on the back it starts
charging<00:02:49.680> how<00:02:50.310> cool<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.020> very<00:02:52.020> very

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
charging how cool is that very very

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.190 
charging how cool is that very very
simple<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:54.090> really<00:02:54.600> good<00:02:54.810> way<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.960> doing

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
simple and a really good way of doing

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.910 
simple and a really good way of doing
things<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.960> only<00:02:58.170> thing<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.770> it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
things and it the only thing is it is it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.770 
things and it the only thing is it is it
doesn't<00:02:59.670> turn<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.360> think<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.750> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
doesn't turn off I think you have to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.720 
doesn't turn off I think you have to
press<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.290> hold<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.830> back<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.400> turn<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
press and hold on the back to turn the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.160 
press and hold on the back to turn the
charge<00:03:02.970> off<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.360> there<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.570> go<00:03:03.600> now<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.020> not

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
charge off so there you go now it's not

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.820 
charge off so there you go now it's not
charging<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:05.370> quick<00:03:05.580> press<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.830> it's

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
charging so a quick press and it's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.710 
charging so a quick press and it's
charging<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:09.210> press<00:03:09.960> and<00:03:10.140> hold<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.720> it

charging and then press and hold and it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.780 
charging and then press and hold and it
stops<00:03:13.020> charging<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.830> conserve<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> battery

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
stops charging to conserve the battery

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.010 
stops charging to conserve the battery
in<00:03:14.850> here<00:03:14.910> when<00:03:15.540> you're<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:15.990> hundred

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
in here when you're up to one hundred

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.370 
in here when you're up to one hundred
percent<00:03:16.320> on<00:03:16.890> your<00:03:17.400> iPhone<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.390> don't<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
percent on your iPhone you don't need to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
percent on your iPhone you don't need to
charge<00:03:19.590> any<00:03:19.830> longer<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.310> may<00:03:20.520> as<00:03:20.550> well

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
charge any longer so you may as well

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.910 
charge any longer so you may as well
sort<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.420> save<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:21.810> little<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.290> battery<00:03:22.740> in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
sort of save a little bit of battery in

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.190 
sort of save a little bit of battery in
that<00:03:22.950> external<00:03:23.370> battery<00:03:23.880> pack<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.900> let's<00:03:25.020> turn

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
that external battery pack so let's turn

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.890 
that external battery pack so let's turn
that<00:03:25.320> off<00:03:25.440> again<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> we're<00:03:27.270> now<00:03:27.390> turned<00:03:27.690> off

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
that off again so we're now turned off

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.190 
that off again so we're now turned off
and<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:29.310> can<00:03:29.550> release<00:03:29.880> these<00:03:30.150> suction<00:03:30.420> cups

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
and we can release these suction cups

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.500 
and we can release these suction cups
it's<00:03:32.130> going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.370> take<00:03:32.580> my<00:03:32.730> screen<00:03:33.060> protector

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
it's going to take my screen protector

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.130 
it's going to take my screen protector
off<00:03:33.630> probably<00:03:34.220> which<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.510> that's<00:03:36.510> okay<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
off probably which is that's okay and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.330 
off probably which is that's okay and
then<00:03:37.770> we<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:37.980> disconnect<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.870> iphone<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
then we just disconnect the iphone like

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.230 
then we just disconnect the iphone like
so<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.620> we<00:03:43.620> will<00:03:43.770> replace<00:03:44.100> my<00:03:44.400> back<00:03:44.640> protector

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
so and we will replace my back protector

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.240 
so and we will replace my back protector
that's<00:03:45.960> not<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> problem<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:47.040> only<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
that's not a problem it's only a

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.060 
that's not a problem it's only a
temporary<00:03:47.520> back<00:03:48.060> protector<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.070> and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
temporary back protector on here and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.910 
temporary back protector on here and
then<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:51.090> will<00:03:51.210> put<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.660> iphone<00:03:52.200> back<00:03:52.500> into<00:03:52.800> my

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
then we will put my iphone back into my

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.350 
then we will put my iphone back into my
case<00:03:53.190> now<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.490> case<00:03:53.700> i'm<00:03:53.940> using<00:03:53.970> at<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
case now the case i'm using at the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.640 
case now the case i'm using at the
moment<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:56.100> speck<00:03:56.730> candyshell<00:03:57.630> flip<00:03:58.500> i

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
moment is this speck candyshell flip i

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.930 
moment is this speck candyshell flip i
think<00:03:58.860> it's<00:03:59.010> called<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.400> was<00:03:59.550> my<00:03:59.670> sort<00:03:59.880> of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
think it's called this was my sort of

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.820 
think it's called this was my sort of
favorite<00:04:00.330> case<00:04:00.570> throughout<00:04:00.990> my<00:04:01.230> review<00:04:01.620> of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
favorite case throughout my review of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.070 
favorite case throughout my review of
all<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.520> different<00:04:02.790> cases<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> iphone

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
all the different cases for the iphone

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.200 
all the different cases for the iphone
and<00:04:04.530> according<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.640> manufacturer<00:04:06.150> it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
and according to the manufacturer it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.540 
and according to the manufacturer it
should<00:04:06.570> still<00:04:07.110> be<00:04:07.170> able<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.530> be<00:04:07.830> used<00:04:08.040> in<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
should still be able to be used in the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.690 
should still be able to be used in the
case<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.570> let's<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> look<00:04:10.080> well<00:04:10.980> it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
case so let's have a look well it

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.880 
case so let's have a look well it
doesn't<00:04:11.880> work<00:04:12.270> with<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:13.020> as<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.770> can

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
doesn't work with this one as you can

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.120 
doesn't work with this one as you can
see<00:04:14.190> because<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.660> bulk<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.140> this<00:04:16.650> portion

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
see because of the bulk of this portion

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.580 
see because of the bulk of this portion
here<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:18.120> cannot<00:04:18.600> get<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.230> Lightning

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
here you cannot get the Lightning

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.430 
here you cannot get the Lightning
connector<00:04:19.710> into<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.430> phone<00:04:20.670> so<00:04:21.330> do<00:04:21.690> bear<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
connector into the phone so do bear that

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.170 
connector into the phone so do bear that
in<00:04:22.590> mind<00:04:22.620> now<00:04:23.430> what<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.669> going<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.850> give<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.150> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
in mind now what I'm going to give you a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.180 
in mind now what I'm going to give you a
general<00:04:24.479> advice<00:04:24.780> is

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
general advice is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.190 
general advice is
I<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.430> tested<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.000> with<00:04:27.180> other<00:04:27.480> cases<00:04:27.750> and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
I have tested this with other cases and

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.410 
I have tested this with other cases and
if<00:04:28.650> you're<00:04:28.800> using<00:04:29.070> one<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> very<00:04:29.700> thins<00:04:30.150> or

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
if you're using one of the very thins or

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.720 
if you're using one of the very thins or
feather-light<00:04:31.080> cases<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> it's<00:04:32.400> got<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.640> be<00:04:32.700> a

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
feather-light cases and it's got to be a

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.880 
feather-light cases and it's got to be a
glossy<00:04:33.150> one<00:04:33.450> really<00:04:33.900> for<00:04:34.140> these<00:04:34.260> suction<00:04:34.530> cups

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
glossy one really for these suction cups

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.370 
glossy one really for these suction cups
to<00:04:35.010> work<00:04:35.280> then<00:04:35.970> this<00:04:36.180> connector<00:04:36.720> will<00:04:36.990> still

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
to work then this connector will still

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.950 
to work then this connector will still
go<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:37.740> but<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.940> big<00:04:39.180> shame<00:04:39.480> if<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
go in but that is a big shame if the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.930 
go in but that is a big shame if the
manufacturer<00:04:40.440> had<00:04:40.710> tapered<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.370> down<00:04:41.640> a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
manufacturer had tapered this down a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.180 
manufacturer had tapered this down a
little<00:04:42.300> bit<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.170> make<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> thinner<00:04:43.710> it

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
little bit more to make it thinner it

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.620 
little bit more to make it thinner it
still<00:04:44.610> would<00:04:44.790> have<00:04:44.820> been<00:04:45.060> able<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> be<00:04:45.450> used

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
still would have been able to be used

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.690 
still would have been able to be used
for<00:04:45.810> cases<00:04:46.230> like<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.830> think<00:04:47.160> that

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
for cases like this and I think that

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.790 
for cases like this and I think that
most<00:04:47.940> cases<00:04:48.270> are<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.680> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
most cases are like this this is the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.100 
most cases are like this this is the
case<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.190> generally<00:04:50.850> like<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.510> use<00:04:51.840> something

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
case I generally like to use something

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.020 
case I generally like to use something
with<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> dual<00:04:52.650> layer<00:04:52.680> protection<00:04:53.310> this

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
with a dual layer protection this

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.960 
with a dual layer protection this
particular<00:04:54.360> product<00:04:55.400> is<00:04:56.400> not<00:04:56.670> going<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.910> work

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
particular product is not going to work

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.270 
particular product is not going to work
with<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.660> dual<00:04:57.840> layer<00:04:58.080> protection<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:59.250> i

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
with the dual layer protection but i

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.250 
with the dual layer protection but i
will<00:04:59.490> say<00:04:59.790> now<00:05:00.270> we<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:00.540> take<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:00.810> out<00:05:01.020> game

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
will say now we just take this out game

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.740 
will say now we just take this out game
day<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:02.070> still<00:05:02.400> very<00:05:02.760> good<00:05:03.090> products<00:05:03.450> in<00:05:03.630> my

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
day is still very good products in my

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.710 
day is still very good products in my
opinion<00:05:04.050> it's<00:05:04.620> such<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:05.130> cool<00:05:05.460> design<00:05:05.670> and<00:05:06.150> with

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
opinion it's such a cool design and with

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.080 
opinion it's such a cool design and with
a<00:05:06.750> little<00:05:07.050> bit<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.490> manipulation<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
a little bit of manipulation to the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.970 
a little bit of manipulation to the
design<00:05:09.420> i<00:05:09.690> think<00:05:10.050> like<00:05:10.320> i<00:05:10.440> said<00:05:10.650> if<00:05:10.800> they<00:05:10.920> were

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
design i think like i said if they were

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.310 
design i think like i said if they were
just<00:05:11.340> tapered<00:05:11.820> this<00:05:12.000> section<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.660> little<00:05:13.200> bit

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
just tapered this section a little bit

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.040 
just tapered this section a little bit
more<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:14.100> would<00:05:14.310> be<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.880> perfect<00:05:15.210> product<00:05:15.810> as

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
more it would be the perfect product as

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.350 
more it would be the perfect product as
it<00:05:16.680> is<00:05:16.830> i<00:05:16.860> still<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.520> it<00:05:17.760> because<00:05:17.880> if<00:05:18.240> you

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
it is i still like it because if you

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.090 
it is i still like it because if you
don't<00:05:18.540> use<00:05:18.780> your<00:05:18.810> iphone<00:05:19.200> in<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.440> case<00:05:19.620> or<00:05:19.920> if

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
don't use your iphone in the case or if

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.340 
don't use your iphone in the case or if
you<00:05:20.220> use<00:05:20.400> it<00:05:20.580> in<00:05:20.640> a<00:05:20.730> slimline<00:05:21.060> case<00:05:21.480> it's<00:05:22.020> still

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
you use it in a slimline case it's still

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.620 
you use it in a slimline case it's still
going<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.590> work<00:05:22.770> very<00:05:23.310> well<00:05:23.400> indeed<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.240> the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
going to work very well indeed and the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.660 
going to work very well indeed and the
fact<00:05:24.870> that<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.260> doesn't<00:05:25.590> add<00:05:25.710> on<00:05:25.860> too<00:05:26.460> much

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
fact that it doesn't add on too much
