Hurst factory in Detroit well now that
the<00:00:40.600> whole<00:00:40.719> thing<00:00:40.929> about<00:00:41.079> light<00:00:41.350> weights<00:00:41.559> was

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
the whole thing about light weights was

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.559 
the whole thing about light weights was
pulling<00:00:42.190> weight<00:00:42.339> out<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.760> moving<00:00:42.969> it<00:00:43.179> around

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
pulling weight out and moving it around

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.049 
pulling weight out and moving it around
exactly<00:00:44.170> drag<00:00:44.530> racing<00:00:45.010> is<00:00:45.190> all<00:00:45.460> about<00:00:45.760> weight

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
imbalance and one of the things that

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.069 
imbalance and one of the things that
they<00:00:48.460> did<00:00:48.519> with<00:00:48.850> this<00:00:48.999> particular<00:00:49.179> model<00:00:49.719> is

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
to move a lot of weight from the front

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.819 
to move a lot of weight from the front
to<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.449> back<00:00:52.600> they<00:00:53.109> moved<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.379> lot<00:00:53.559> of<00:00:53.679> back

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
battery to there they they moved a lot

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.139 
battery to there they they moved a lot
of<00:00:56.109> battery<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.829> they<00:00:57.159> put<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.489> very<00:00:57.579> heavy

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149

plate underneath it and it really helped

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.410 
plate underneath it and it really helped
the<00:01:00.190> performance<00:01:00.729> and<00:01:00.909> traction<00:01:01.329> in

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
the performance and traction in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.629 
the performance and traction in
particular<00:01:01.960> well<00:01:02.530> now<00:01:02.649> in<00:01:02.799> pulling<00:01:03.399> weight

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
particular well now in pulling weight

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.440 
particular well now in pulling weight
out<00:01:03.789> of<00:01:03.819> the<00:01:03.969> car<00:01:04.180> then<00:01:04.690> would<00:01:04.960> with<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.450> back

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
out of the car then would with this back

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.120 
out of the car then would with this back
window<00:01:07.690> have<00:01:07.900> been<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.110> light<00:01:08.350> weight<00:01:08.530> no

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
window have been a light weight no

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.440 
window have been a light weight no
actually<00:01:09.549> they<00:01:09.729> wanted<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.120> keep<00:01:10.270> that

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
take a look at this big elephant motor

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
take a look at this big elephant motor
well<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.690> light<00:02:57.870> hood<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
well very light hood in it that's the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.010 
well very light hood in it that's the
mitt<00:02:59.460> that's<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.880> idea<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.450> guess<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
mitt that's the idea I guess that is the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.680 
mitt that's the idea I guess that is the
point<00:03:01.640> yeah<00:03:02.640> how<00:03:02.850> did<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.090> ever<00:03:03.270> get<00:03:03.540> that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
point yeah how did they ever get that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.060 
point yeah how did they ever get that
thing<00:03:03.750> shoe<00:03:04.110> hard<00:03:04.320> they<00:03:04.410> had<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> lot<00:03:05.040> of

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
master cylinder is a good example of how

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.580 
master cylinder is a good example of how
they<00:03:11.550> had<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.940> build<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.510> special<00:03:12.750> relocation

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
they had to build a special relocation

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.150 
they had to build a special relocation
block<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.070> move<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.460> outboard<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.740> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
block to move it outboard so that the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.770 
block to move it outboard so that the
Hemi<00:03:17.370> motor<00:03:17.580> would<00:03:17.790> actually<00:03:18.210> fit<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.540> there

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
Hemi motor would actually fit in there

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.320 
Hemi motor would actually fit in there
with<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.110> valve<00:03:19.320> covers<00:03:19.740> in<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.820> order<00:03:21.120> for
