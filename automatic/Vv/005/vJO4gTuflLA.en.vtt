comics<00:00:58.420> but<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.539> game<00:00:59.690> achromatic<00:01:00.019> will

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
comics but the game achromatic will

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.910 
comics but the game achromatic will
probably<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.649> big<00:01:00.800> draw<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:03.109> here<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.679> one<00:01:03.829> of

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
probably the big draw so here is one of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.740 
probably the big draw so here is one of
the<00:01:03.980> games<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.309> came<00:01:04.369> with<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:05.269> came<00:01:05.600> with

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
the games that came with it came with

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.719 
the games that came with it came with
the<00:01:05.869> game<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:07.790> plays<00:01:08.060> normally<00:01:08.390> like<00:01:08.689> this<00:01:09.729> so

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
the game it plays normally like this so

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.060 
the game it plays normally like this so
I'm<00:01:11.000> avoiding<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.600> paratroopa<00:01:14.829> now<00:01:15.829> under

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
I'm avoiding the paratroopa now under

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.249 
I'm avoiding the paratroopa now under
the<00:01:16.159> hood<00:01:16.280> I<00:01:16.640> can<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.720> graphics<00:01:18.049> tab

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
the hood I can go a to the graphics tab

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.380 
the hood I can go a to the graphics tab
and<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.490> see<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.990> know<00:01:21.079> here's<00:01:21.320> Mario<00:01:21.560> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
and I can see you know here's Mario and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.080 
and I can see you know here's Mario and
maybe<00:01:24.250> maybe<00:01:25.250> I'm<00:01:25.400> one<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.610> those<00:01:25.670> guys<00:01:25.880> that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
maybe maybe I'm one of those guys that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.840 
maybe maybe I'm one of those guys that
likes<00:01:26.329> Luigi<00:01:26.780> better

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
likes Luigi better

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.880 
likes Luigi better
so<00:01:28.850> let's<00:01:29.090> actually<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.049> think<00:01:30.110> Luigi<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.710> this

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
so let's actually I think Luigi is this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.320 
so let's actually I think Luigi is this
color

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320 

so<00:01:37.330> maybe<00:01:37.510> I'll<00:01:37.630> be<00:01:37.720> Luigi<00:01:38.080> for<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.290> while<00:01:39.330> and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
so maybe I'll be Luigi for a while and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.120 
so maybe I'll be Luigi for a while and
then<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:40.960> want<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.200> see<00:01:41.290> how<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:41.560> looks<00:01:41.770> I

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
then if I want to see how that looks I

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.670 
then if I want to see how that looks I
can<00:01:42.940> immediately<00:01:43.060> go<00:01:43.330> back<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.570> play<00:01:46.680> of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
can immediately go back to play of

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.810 
can immediately go back to play of
course<00:01:47.890> because<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.220> only<00:01:48.310> animate<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.700> only

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
course because I only animate it only

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.310 
course because I only animate it only
change<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.240> one<00:01:49.360> frame<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.750> animation<00:01:50.140> looks

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
change the one frame the animation looks

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.360 
change the one frame the animation looks
all<00:01:50.440> silly<00:01:50.650> now<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.830> also<00:01:53.950> change<00:01:54.190> the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
all silly now but I can also change the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.360 
all silly now but I can also change the
background<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.830> want<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.630> happen

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
background if I want to have it happen

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.560 
background if I want to have it happen
in<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.610> bright<00:02:00.820> yellow<00:02:00.970> place<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:02.020> do<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.290> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in a bright yellow place I can do that I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.720 
in a bright yellow place I can do that I
can<00:02:04.570> add<00:02:05.380> stamps<00:02:06.070> if<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.400> want<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.700> a

the game logic this is how the basic set
up<00:02:36.520> here<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.940> trigger<00:02:37.360> happens<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.200> when

course you can also create your own

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.190 
course you can also create your own
games<00:03:02.230> from<00:03:02.380> scratch<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.870> record<00:03:05.110> my

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
games from scratch so the record my

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.290 
games from scratch so the record my
chromatic<00:03:05.590> is<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.459> same<00:03:06.640> as<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.850> music<00:03:07.120> maker

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
chromatic is the same as the music maker

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.680 
chromatic is the same as the music maker
that's<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.750> game<00:03:07.900> there's<00:03:08.890> also<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.690> bunch

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that's in the game there's also a bunch

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.640 
that's in the game there's also a bunch
of<00:03:10.750> different<00:03:11.020> kinds<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.260> instruments<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
of different kinds of instruments to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.330 
of different kinds of instruments to
choose<00:03:11.860> from

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.809 

and<00:03:16.500> five<00:03:17.500> different<00:03:17.709> tracks<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.459> work<00:03:18.610> with

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
and five different tracks to work with

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.000 
and five different tracks to work with
so<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.120> can<00:03:19.209> have<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> harmony<00:03:19.989> going<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.560> can<00:03:20.860> also

have a rhythm section the other thing
that's<00:03:23.380> really<00:03:23.680> intriguing<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:25.170> the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that's really intriguing is the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.290 
that's really intriguing is the
