ideas come from I remember I wrote a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
ideas come from I remember I wrote a
book<00:00:57.149> two<00:00:57.390> years<00:00:57.420> ago<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.960> hit<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> ground

book two years ago I hit the ground

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
book two years ago I hit the ground
leading<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.579> wrote<00:00:59.940> most<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.480> chapters

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
leading and I wrote most of my chapters

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.330 
leading and I wrote most of my chapters
while<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.289> running<00:01:01.590> every<00:01:01.829> morning<00:01:01.859> that's

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
while I was running every morning that's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
while I was running every morning that's
when<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.670> thought<00:01:03.090> well<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.600> sitting<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
when I thought well not sitting at the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
when I thought well not sitting at the
desk<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.580> important

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
desk so I think it's really important

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
desk so I think it's really important
from<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.659> career<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:06.990> well<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.200> yourself

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
from your career as well as yourself

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
from your career as well as yourself
makes<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.280> sense<00:01:08.630> why<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.689> some<00:01:09.990> people

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
makes so much sense why do some people

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539 
makes so much sense why do some people
though<00:01:10.409> feel<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:10.890> can't<00:01:11.159> disconnect

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
though feel that they can't disconnect

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
though feel that they can't disconnect
because<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.229> yeah<00:01:13.470> at

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
because they're all the time yeah at

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.270 
because they're all the time yeah at
home<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.330> BlackBerry<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:17.040> on

with<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.310> they're<00:01:20.430> gonna<00:01:20.520> miss<00:01:20.729> something

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
with what they're gonna miss something

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.800 
with what they're gonna miss something
mm-hmm

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
mm-hmm

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.999 
mm-hmm
well<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.590> there's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> couple

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
well I think you know there's a couple

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.410 
well I think you know there's a couple
of<00:01:23.220> reasons<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of reasons one of them is this is a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.990 
of reasons one of them is this is a
decade<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> volatile<00:01:25.920> business<00:01:26.400> times<00:01:26.670> right

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
decade of volatile business times right

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.390 
decade of volatile business times right
and<00:01:27.030> jobs<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:28.110> changing<00:01:28.140> companies<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.220> -

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and jobs are changing companies are -

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.160 
and jobs are changing companies are -
yes<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.729> people<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.210> quite<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.630> secure<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.330 
urgent must look at and I put it away an
hour<00:02:43.840> later<00:02:44.200> so<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> think<00:02:44.799> it's<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.069> about

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
hour later so I think it's all about

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.330 
hour later so I think it's all about
setting<00:02:46.120> boundaries<00:02:46.840> around<00:02:47.319> what<00:02:47.799> you're

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
setting boundaries around what you're

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.949 
setting boundaries around what you're
doing<00:02:48.609> while<00:02:48.819> you're<00:02:48.849> away<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.569> you<00:02:49.659> can

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
doing while you're away so that you can

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.839 
doing while you're away so that you can
actually<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.799> chill<00:02:51.099> time<00:02:51.400> where<00:02:51.700> your

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
actually have that chill time where your

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.360 
actually have that chill time where your
brain<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.329> doing<00:02:52.510> something<00:02:52.659> besides<00:02:53.409> work<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
brain is doing something besides work so

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.360 
brain is doing something besides work so
that<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.639> can<00:02:54.879> you<00:02:55.150> know<00:02:55.269> get<00:02:55.659> that<00:02:55.930> creative

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
that you can you know get that creative
