00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.819
 can draw 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.670
 ordinary creeper for this will need 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.120
 pencil and the most common non-thoughtful 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.519
 some kind of unusual it's scary we need 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.560
 There will be a notebook for took such in the store 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 because she liked me and everything 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 whether it should be either in the cell 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.550
 Adding this already as you want also 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.699
 we will need colored pencils and they 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 composed it we start drawing twice 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.399
 then we are somewhere in the middle well, and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 the solution to a big crisis is no higher 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:45.360
 approximately on 5 cells we draw specifics 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.920
 in the fifth line of draw as much the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.090
 there is it like two lines 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.090
 If you look here it is on clay 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 will cross out 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.510
 draw the body 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.160
 you will take some ideas may 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.590
 be going to take from i am ok forest 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.370
 by the way just comments ok u 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.260
 I get it or not I of course 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.640
 not at all he draw it on so well 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.640
 here is our torso 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:28.310
 we close it it should be 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:31.580
 about 4 perhaps four loans 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.160
 up to 4 and head deal about the other we do on 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.440
 one line is the same as hum 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:44.509
 maybe a little bit 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:48.740
 see how personally we are doing 3 not well 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.460
 here it is a problem so we do here 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:02:03.200
 two lines you can see something 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 gets so connect so we do more 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.330
 one line 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.290
 the most we are so good 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:17.390
 do the same thing with legs legs and for 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:22.220
 that did not set the edge of the bath did not steal provide 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.940
 a precise and here are conducting line and that's how it 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.630
 so convenient we get now we 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.470
 have to get up jail well here it is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.470
 mascara 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.110
 so what 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.250
 well, sort of 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:02.790
 I think you have to be this wipe 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.640
 ok now draw eyes i don't know not 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.319
 I can draw now try 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.189
 I will not paint it much 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.609
 right 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.250
 shiver draw here forge a face because 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.560
 what I can't I don't want to wind up 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450
 still make this video take long 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.939
 your time so you can just amount 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.790
 it's red draw take green 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.260
 pencil 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.609
 I like green better dark but to me 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.400
 for some reason we paint over anyone 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.359
 the back of the world staining is strong then 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:43.470
 have you pass on this part we 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:48.139
 painting strongly face and later we 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.139
 let's say in chemistry 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.560
 and serves as a settlement paint 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:06.299
 this is not too boring to watch this 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.019
 as terskov also on my channel will 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.599
 small 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.030
 small competitions i mean i'm an example 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.280
 I will be with my friends and with someone 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.099
 we will draw pictures and then you will 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.109
 in the comments or in the VKontakte group 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:24.599
 write who got the picture for the better 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.680
 me or my friends there in general 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.570
 will be pretty fun 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:33.389
 I don't know if someone did something like that, but 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.470
 it seems to me no one is an angel you can 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.909
 draw finish something else 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.770
 Nizamuddin is possible to finish him something 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.240
 in principle, everything is all bye 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.240
 see you in the next series
