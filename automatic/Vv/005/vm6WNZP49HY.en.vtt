00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 cynical it's a scenic but with a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 much more aggressive design a lot 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.240
 more attractive many more passionate 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 and then at the same time with 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.450
 inside a rate of beats that is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.070
 much closer to the wish of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 some drivers go from one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 very schering weather environment 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.330
 sharing on stage an environment of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.330
 pilots 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 we wanted to accentuate in sportiness 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.820
 of the basic vehicle by working on it 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.210
 more about seat confections for 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.020
 make a little more 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.790
 sports and support the seat is added 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.650
 a steering wheel also a little bit higher 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.680
 of range by recovering a steering wheel 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
 laguna and then the novelty of 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
 the interior and the center console on 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 which we wanted to bring a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 special finish 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.100
 there are three modes the mode more you 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.440
 usual is the normal road mode 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.090
 the car and handle completely way 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.920
 automatic and there is a mode 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.750
 completely manual or the driver 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.490
 takes control and drives the 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.370
 couple with sap the accelerator 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.230
 between the two a very specific mode 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.060
 ben laden snow that allows the driver 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.440
 thanks special tires to have 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.620
 special adjustment for the floors 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.620
 furniture 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.500
 the renault multimedia system and alix a 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.230
 very simple system that aims to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.959
 gather in one and the same object the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 world of multimedia navigation from 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.260
 telephony that is connected to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.090
 vehicles so we recover from 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.830
 vehicle information especially for 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 the trading &amp; co 2 program for example 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.690
 which offers access to a certain 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 number of apps and at the store 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.769
 of erling store apps and it's a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.700
 last world they show 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.260
 settings 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.410
 so it's a very easy system 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.410
 of use
