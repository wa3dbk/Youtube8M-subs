okay check this out I'm on a very high
block<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.390> so<00:00:06.540> let's<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.740> what<00:00:07.890> happens<00:00:08.250> if

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
block here so let's see what happens if

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.129 
block here so let's see what happens if
I<00:00:08.519> fall<00:00:08.580> off<00:00:10.580> boom

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
I fall off boom

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.189 
I fall off boom
how<00:00:13.139> cool<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:14.130> okay<00:00:15.120> wait<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
how cool is that okay wait it

how cool is that okay wait it
unfortunately<00:00:17.130> only<00:00:17.460> works<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.359> game<00:00:18.990> o2<00:00:19.199> but

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
unfortunately only works in game o2 but

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
unfortunately only works in game o2 but
so<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:23.130> might<00:00:23.369> guess<00:00:23.699> what<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.180> doing<00:00:24.510> here

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
so you might guess what I'm doing here

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
so you might guess what I'm doing here
and<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.640> very<00:00:26.640> easy<00:00:26.760> actually<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:28.760> there

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and it's very easy actually to do there

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.150 
and it's very easy actually to do there
command<00:00:30.720> looks<00:00:30.960> oh<00:00:32.360> I<00:00:33.360> guess<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
command looks oh I guess you know that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.500 
command looks oh I guess you know that
but<00:00:35.760> anyway<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.809> falling<00:00:37.489> falling<00:00:38.489> sent<00:00:39.000> or

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
but anyway it's falling falling sent or

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
but anyway it's falling falling sent or
actually<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.280> sandstone<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:42.000> motion<00:00:43.520> upward

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
actually a sandstone with motion upward

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.750 
actually a sandstone with motion upward
so<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.210> flying<00:00:45.660> upwards<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.430> I've<00:00:47.430> got

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
so it is flying upwards and I've got

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.470 
so it is flying upwards and I've got
these<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.430> set<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> five<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
these and this one is set to five and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
these and this one is set to five and
this<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.260> set<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> three<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.500> that<00:00:55.500> that's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this one is set to three so that that's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.970 
this one is set to three so that that's
just<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> should<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.559> input<00:00:58.559> every

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
just so I should have to input every

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.979 
just so I should have to input every
position<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.629> copy<00:01:00.840> paste

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
position that's just so I can copy paste

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.149 
position that's just so I can copy paste
them<00:01:01.350> easily<00:01:01.829> using<00:01:02.640> mcedit<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:04.159> well

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
them easily using mcedit and well

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.719 
them easily using mcedit and well
basically<00:01:05.400> every<00:01:05.970> time<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.750> powered

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
basically every time that it's powered

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.640 
basically every time that it's powered
you<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.750> looks<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.470> cool

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
you will see that it looks pretty cool

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.690 
you will see that it looks pretty cool
if<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> ask<00:01:14.340> me<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.009> also<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
if you ask me and you can also see here

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.280 
if you ask me and you can also see here
this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.330> scoreboard<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.560> set<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.400> full

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
this is a scoreboard it's set to full

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.160 
this is a scoreboard it's set to full
basically<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> created<00:01:23.070> new<00:01:23.189> scoreboards

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
basically I created new scoreboards

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.280 
basically I created new scoreboards
reactives

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
reactives

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.270 
reactives
and<00:01:27.200> call<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> fall<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.729> call<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.150> stats

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
and call it fall and then call it stats

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450 
and call it fall and then call it stats
believe<00:01:32.280> fall<00:01:33.229> 1cm<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.680> sure<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.100> cm

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
believe fall 1cm I'm not sure what cm

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.510 
believe fall 1cm I'm not sure what cm
stands<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:36.509> anyway<00:01:37.100> every<00:01:38.100> time<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
stands for but anyway every time you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.260 
stands for but anyway every time you
fall<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.900> sound<00:01:40.860> or<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.850> actually

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
fall and make that sound or or actually

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.330 
fall and make that sound or or actually
you<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.810> any<00:01:42.960> particles<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.009> doesn't

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you see any particles because it doesn't

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.100 
you see any particles because it doesn't
work<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.180> jumping<00:01:45.570> without

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
work when you're just jumping without

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.219 
work when you're just jumping without
the<00:01:46.259> jump<00:01:46.500> boost<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:48.479> score<00:01:48.960> will<00:01:49.200> go

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the jump boost then your score will go

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.010 
the jump boost then your score will go
up<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.479> it's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
up one and what this one does is it's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.569 
up one and what this one does is it's
tests<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.979> anyone<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.540> my<00:01:55.140> name<00:01:55.549> my<00:01:56.549> name

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
tests for anyone with a my name my name

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.910 
tests for anyone with a my name my name
of<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:59.040> once<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.479> full<00:02:01.469> set<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of one so once you get one full set to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.340 
of one so once you get one full set to
one<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.600> automatically<00:02:03.600> set<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> back<00:02:04.290> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
one it will automatically set it back to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
one it will automatically set it back to
zero<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.070> there's<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.180> comparator

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
zero and there's also this comparator

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:16.700 
zero and there's also this comparator
which<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.530> spawning<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:10.009> let's<00:02:11.009> see

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.430 

right<00:02:17.710> over<00:02:17.890> here<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.430> redstone<00:02:18.760> block<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
right over here is a redstone block and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.040 
right over here is a redstone block and
it's<00:02:20.440> making<00:02:21.340> its<00:02:21.640> well<00:02:22.210> not<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.660> jump

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it's making its well not really jump

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.560 
it's making its well not really jump
it's<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.500> making<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.950> an<00:02:24.190> entity<00:02:24.580> because

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
it's just making it an entity because

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.050 
it's just making it an entity because
time<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.020> set<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.320> zero<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.980> really<00:02:27.850> said

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
time is set to zero and really said

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.850 
time is set to zero and really said
setting<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.780> back<00:02:28.990> really<00:02:29.230> quick<00:02:29.590> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
setting it back really quick so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.240 
setting it back really quick so
everything<00:02:30.490> will<00:02:30.610> be<00:02:30.790> powered<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.960> way<00:02:32.250> so

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
everything will be powered that way so

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.560 
everything will be powered that way so
yeah<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.640> cool

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
yeah really cool

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.990 
yeah really cool
I'll<00:02:35.320> actually<00:02:35.830> for<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> first<00:02:36.370> time<00:02:36.820> we'll

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
I'll actually for the first time we'll

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.380 
I'll actually for the first time we'll
put<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> download<00:02:37.840> link<00:02:38.760> schematic<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:39.970> well

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
put a download link schematic or well

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.380 
put a download link schematic or well
actually<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.780> world<00:02:41.020> folder<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.240> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
actually a world folder to in the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.420 
actually a world folder to in the
