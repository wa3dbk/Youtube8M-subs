00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.720
 today I have another recipe for pancakes 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.840
 but this time it's going to be for everyone 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.910
 those who like the banana and 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.580
 let's start with the ingredients 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 we are going to need 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.740
 again baking powder 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.510
 sodium bicarbonate 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.510
 we are going to need flour 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.600
 we are going to need egg 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:42.200
 banana 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.200
 milk and also oil 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.230
 and little vanilla too 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.230
 all right 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.760
 let's start crushing a banana what 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's grind well with a fork or with 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.130
 the grinder of beans or the puree of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.430
 potatoes the one you have there at the 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.430
 hand 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.070
 once we have the banana well 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.270
 we are going to add the egg and go 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 to mix very well 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.240
 Y 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.190
 We are going to add the teaspoon of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 vanilla we mix 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.940
 and then we're going to add a teaspoon 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.330
 of sugar if the banana is what 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.950
 mature enough to be sweet 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.740
 it is not necessary to add the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:58.470
 teaspoon of sugar and two tablespoons of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.760
 vegetable oil olive oil 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 safflower of which they have 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:10.819
 then add the baking powder 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.939
 baking soda we mix very well 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.939
 Y 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 and we add the cup and a half of flour and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.200
 once again we mix very well 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:48.600
 and finally we add the milk cup 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.600
 and we mix well 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 all right 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.040
 once we have our mix already 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.490
 for the pancakes, we leave it to a 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.450
 and then with the banana that we 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.630
 We'll cut it into slices and 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.540
 let's make a banana sauce that 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.970
 It's super simple in a pan 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.390
 cited at medium-high heat we put a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.470
 little oil and add the 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.560
 bananas 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.810
 they can leave golden brown or as 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 you like it 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 then we add 2 teaspoons 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.040
 brown sugar we leave there to be made 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.530
 like a salsita and ready we're going to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.530
 have our silver sauce 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.409
 ah 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.870
 in our frying pan or the griddle we are going to 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.520
 put a little oil and we 're going to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.640
 clean with a napkin this nothing else 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:15.240
 so that we do not stick the bread kings 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.590
 and we make all the mix the same 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.600
 procedure we add the mixture and the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.410
 turn around once you're already with 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.410
 Bubbles 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.000
 this mix will also leave us 6 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.190
 Pancakes 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.510
 with 174 calories each in this case 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.030
 it is no longer necessary for us to add 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.300
 honey because that's why we made our 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.080
 banana sauce then I hope that you 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.080
 like 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.549
 comment and give thanks
